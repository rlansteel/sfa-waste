    "overall_summary": "Denmark generates a relatively high amount of municipal solid waste (MSW) at around 4.9 million tons per year, but has achieved high recycling and incineration rates, diverting most waste from landfills. Key challenges include reducing waste generation and increasing circularity.",

      "scale_and_rate": "With a population of around 5.8 million and high-income status, Denmark generates a significant amount of MSW totaling 4.9 million tons per year, or around 0.84 tons per capita annually. While total waste generation increased until 2018, more recent data suggests a potential decoupling from economic growth.",
