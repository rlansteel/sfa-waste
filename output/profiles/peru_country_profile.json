    "overall_summary": "Peru generates around 8.4 million tons of municipal solid waste annually, with a recycling rate of only 4% and over 56% disposed in open dumps. Key challenges include improving waste collection coverage, transitioning from open dumpsites to sanitary landfills, and increasing recycling through formalization of the informal sector.",
    "generation_context": {
      "scale_and_rate": "With a population of around 31 million and an upper-middle income status, Peru generates a significant amount of municipal solid waste totaling over 8 million tons per year. The per capita generation rate is moderate compared to its income level.",
      "contributing_factors_trends": "Rapid urbanization, population growth, and increasing economic activity, particularly in sectors like tourism and industry, are likely contributing to rising waste generation rates in Peru."
    },
    "waste_stream_composition": {
      "summary": "The waste stream in Peru is predominantly organic (50.4%), followed by plastics (10.5%), paper/cardboard (7.4%), and glass (3.1%).",

    "collection_and_transport": {
      "coverage_and_methods": "Peru has a relatively high waste collection coverage of around 83% of the population. Both formal municipal services and informal waste pickers play a role in collection. Specific collection methods are not detailed in the available sources.",

    "treatment_and_disposal": {
      "dominant_methods_summary": "Open dumping is the dominant waste disposal method in Peru, accounting for 56.4% of waste. Only 24% goes to sanitary landfills and 15.6% to controlled landfills. Recycling is very limited at 4%.",
      "infrastructure_highlights": "No specific waste treatment facilities or landfills were highlighted in the web findings.",
      "key_challenges": "A major challenge is transitioning from reliance on open dumpsites to developing sanitary landfill capacity and improving waste treatment infrastructure."

      "informal_sector_role": "The informal waste picker sector plays a role in waste collection and likely informal recycling activities, though their specific role is not detailed."

    "policy_and_governance": {
      "regulatory_framework": "Peru has national solid waste laws and a designated national agency for waste management. However, details on specific local regulations or municipal plans were not provided in the sources reviewed.",
