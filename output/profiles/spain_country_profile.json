    "overall_summary": "Spain, a high-income European country, generates a significant amount of municipal solid waste (MSW) annually, with a recycling rate around 17% and over half going to landfills. Key challenges include increasing recycling and diverting organic waste from landfills through initiatives outlined in the national waste management plan.",
    "generation_context": {
      "scale_and_rate": "With a population of over 47 million and high GDP per capita, Spain generates around 22.4 million tons of MSW annually, or around 475 kg per capita. The web findings do not provide clear trends on generation rates over time.",
