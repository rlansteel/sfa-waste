    "overall_summary": "Spain generates around 22.4 million tons of municipal solid waste annually, with a GDP per capita of around $41,000 USD. The waste stream is dominated by organic waste (49%), followed by paper/cardboard, plastics, glass, metals, and other materials. While total waste generation has decreased in recent years, waste excluding major mineral streams has increased in line with economic growth. Spain has a comprehensive waste collection system in place, though effectiveness of separate collection, especially for bio-waste, needs improvement. The dominant treatment methods are landfilling (55%), recycling (17%), composting (16%), and incineration (12%). Spain meets the 2025 packaging recycling target but more efforts are required to reach municipal waste recycling and landfill reduction targets for 2025 and 2035. Spain has national waste laws, agencies, and plans like PEMAR 2016-2022 aimed at improving waste management and transitioning to a circular economy model.",

      "scale_and_rate": "Spain generated a total of 22.4 million tons of municipal solid waste in the latest reported year, with a GDP per capita of around $41,000 USD. According to some reports, Spain's total waste generation has followed a decreasing trend in recent years, while waste generation excluding major mineral waste has increased overall, roughly following trends in economic growth.",

      "summary": "Based on the composition data, Spain's municipal solid waste stream is predominantly organic (49%), followed by paper/cardboard (15%), plastics (9%), glass (8%), metals (3%), wood (2%), and other materials (14%). The organic fraction makes up nearly half of the waste stream.",

The collection likely involves formal municipal services and private waste management companies. Some reports suggest there is a need to improve the effectiveness of the separate collection system, especially for bio-waste.",
      "key_challenges": "Key challenges mentioned include the need to incentivize better sorting at source and improve the separate collection of bio-waste streams. Enhancing the effectiveness of the overall separate collection system is cited as an area requiring more efforts."

      "dominant_methods_summary": "According to the structured data, the dominant waste treatment methods in Spain are landfilling (55.09%), recycling (16.84%), composting (16.45%), and incineration (11.62%). Some reports suggest Spain has recently managed to slightly increase recycling rates and reduce landfilling of municipal waste, but more efforts are required to meet future targets. The national waste management plan highlights the need to improve separate collection systems, especially for bio-waste, and incentivize sorting at source.",
      "infrastructure_highlights": "No specific information found in sources regarding notable waste treatment/disposal infrastructure or facility types.",
      "key_challenges": "Key challenges related to waste treatment and disposal in Spain include: meeting future EU targets for increasing recycling rates and reducing landfilling of municipal waste, improving effectiveness of separate collection systems (particularly for bio-waste), incentivizing better sorting of waste at the source, and potentially overcoming issues with overestimated recycling rates."

Some reports suggest Spain has recently managed to slightly increase the recycling rate for municipal waste, but still significantly more efforts are required to reach the 2025 target of 55% for preparing for reuse and recycling. Spain already reports a packaging recycling rate above the 2025 target of 65%, however, the rate might be overestimated.",

Some key national plans and strategies mentioned in the web findings include the State Framework Plan for Waste Management (PEMAR) 2016-2022 and the State Waste Prevention Programme 2014-2020. The PEMAR plan aims to improve waste management and move towards a circular economy model.
