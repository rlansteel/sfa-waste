    "overall_summary": "Mexico generates a substantial amount of municipal solid waste, estimated at 53.1 million tons annually or around 0.42 tons per capita. The waste stream is predominantly organic (52.4%), followed by paper/cardboard, plastics, and other components. While sanitary landfilling (74.5%) is the dominant disposal method, open dumping remains prevalent at 21%. Recycling rates are relatively low at 5%, with no data available on composting or incineration. Mexico has enacted national waste management laws and standards, but faces challenges in providing comprehensive collection services, reducing open dumping, expanding recycling and composting infrastructure, and mitigating emissions from large landfills.",
    "generation_context": {
      "scale_and_rate": "Mexico generates a substantial amount of municipal solid waste, with an estimated 53.1 million tons generated annually. This translates to a per capita generation rate of around 0.42 tons per person per year. Some reports suggest the total waste generation has been increasing in recent years, likely driven by factors such as population growth and economic development.",
      "contributing_factors_trends": "Key factors contributing to Mexico's waste generation include its large population of over 125 million, urbanization and growth of major cities like Mexico City, industrial activities, and a thriving tourism sector. According to national plans, the waste generation rate is expected to continue rising due to population growth, economic expansion, and increasing consumption patterns. However, efforts are being made to promote waste reduction and sustainable waste management practices."

    "waste_stream_composition": {
      "summary": "The waste stream composition in Mexico is predominantly organic (52.4%), followed by paper/cardboard (13.8%), plastics (10.9%), other (12.1%), glass (5.9%), and metals (3.4%). Some components like rubber/leather, wood, and yard/garden green waste have no data available.",

      "coverage_and_methods": "No specific information found in sources on the overall waste collection coverage percentage for Mexico. However, some reports suggest a significant role for the informal waste sector in collection activities, particularly in urban areas. The primary methods appear to be municipal collection services and informal waste pickers collecting recyclable materials.",
      "key_challenges": "Key challenges inferred from the data and web findings include: providing adequate waste collection services to the entire population, especially in rural or lower-income areas; integrating and formalizing the role of informal waste workers; and improving collection efficiency and reducing environmental impacts from open dumping or uncontrolled disposal during collection and transport."

    "treatment_and_disposal": {
      "dominant_methods_summary": "According to the structured data, the dominant municipal solid waste treatment and disposal methods in Mexico are sanitary landfilling (74.5%) and open dumping (21%). Some reports suggest open dumping may account for around 25% of landfill gas emissions in the country. Recycling is relatively low at 5%, while composting and incineration percentages are not specified.",
      "infrastructure_highlights": "Large sanitary landfills are highlighted as the primary source of landfill gas emissions in Mexico. Open dumps, while still prevalent, also contribute significantly to emissions. The country has enacted regulations like NOM-161-SEMARNAT-2011 to promote better management of construction and demolition waste.",
      "key_challenges": "Key challenges related to waste treatment and disposal in Mexico include the continued reliance on open dumping practices, lack of comprehensive recycling and composting infrastructure, and emissions from large sanitary landfills. Improving waste diversion, upgrading disposal facilities, and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from the waste sector remain important goals."

Some reports suggest Mexico has developed national plans and standards for waste management, such as the NOM-161-SEMARNAT-2011 standard requiring construction waste management plans since 2013. However, no specific information was found in the sources regarding the existence of a dedicated national waste management agency.",
