It builds to a large extent on the answers provided by the Danish Environmental Protection Agency in April 2021 to a questionnaire developed by the EEA and ETC/WMGE. The EEA and ETC/CE would like to thank the Danish authorities for the provided information and for the kind review of drafts of this assessment report in 2021 and April 2022. 1 Introduction 1.1 Background and purpose The Waste Framework Directive 2008/98/EC (as amended by Directive (EU) 2018/851) includes a target to recycle and prepare for reuse, by 2025, 55 % of municipal waste generated. The Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive (94/62/EC as amended by Directive (EU) 2018/852) includes targets for the recycling of packaging waste, both in total and by material, to be achieved by 2025. The Landfill Directive (1999/31/EC as amended by Directive (EU) 2018/850) requires to limit the landfilling of municipal waste to 10 % of the generated municipal waste by 2035. The Directives also foresee that the European Commission, in cooperation with the European Environment Agency, publishes early warning reports on the Member States’ progress towards the attainment of the targets, including a list of Member States at risk of not attaining the targets within the respective deadlines, three years ahead of the target dates. This assessment is a contribution from the EEA to the early warning reports according to Article 11b Waste Framework Directive and Art. 6b Packaging and Packaging Waste directive. This document is an early warning assessment for Denmark. The document is based on the analysis of a number of factors affecting recycling performance (success and risk factors). The assessment aims at concluding whether Denmark is at risk of missing the targets for municipal waste and packaging waste set in EU legislation for 2025. In addition, it provides a preliminary assessment of the prospects for meeting the 2035 target for landfilling of municipal waste. The assessment takes into account information that was available before 10 May 2022. 1.2 Approach The assessment follows a methodology developed by the EEA and ETC/WMGE and consulted with the Eionet in 2020 (ETC/WMGE, 2021), which was adjusted in 2021 taking into account experiences with applying the methodology in 2021 (ETC/CE & ETC/WMGE, 2022). This methodology uses a set of quantitative and qualitative success and risk factors that have been identified to affect the recycling performance. The assessment is to a large extent based on the information provided by the Member State in the reply to an EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire as well as on available data and information from Eurostat and other relevant sources. In addition, a consortium under contract with the European Commission (led by Rambøll Group) has conducted a critical review of the draft assessment in Q4/2021 and provided further information. More specifically, chapter 2.1 assesses the likelihood for Denmark to achieve the target to prepare for reuse and recycle at least 55 % of municipal solid waste (MSW) for 2025. Chapter 2.2 assesses the likelihood for Denmark to achieve the overall packaging waste and specific packaging materials’ recycling targets for 2025. Chapter 2.3 examines the prospects for Denmark to landfill less than 10 % of the generated municipal solid waste by 2035. The official early warning assessment for the landfilling target is only due in 2032 and accordingly, the assessment contained in Chapter 2.3 is only preliminary. 1.3 Member State profile – context parameters Municipal waste generation and treatment The annual municipal waste generation and treatment has remained rather stable in Denmark between 2016 and 2020. The municipal waste generation was around 5 million tonnes in 2020. Waste generation per capita is very high, with 845 kg/cap in 2020, which is significantly higher than the (estimated) EU average of 505 kg/cap in 2020. The country has a quite even division between waste collected for recycling and waste incineration, being 53.9 % and 45.2 % respectively in 2020. Less than 1 % is being landfilled. Waste collected for material recycling increased between 2016 and 2020 from 29.9 % to 35.5 %, while composting and digestion stagnated around 18.4 %. The recycling rate (collected for material recycling and composting and digestion) has increased from 48.3 % in 2016 to 53.9 % in 2020 (Eurostat, 2022a). Denmark has a very high incineration capacity, roughly double the amount of residual municipal waste sent to incineration in 2019. On 16 June 2020, the Danish Government and Parties representing a broad majority in the Danish Parliament agreed on a Climate plan for a green waste sector and a circular economy. The climate plan includes initiatives – amongst others – towards reducing waste and reducing the capacity for waste incineration. In order to adjust the capacity, a tender-based model is foreseen and the waste incineration plants will have to compete for the waste. Environmental requirements for the incineration plants will be tightened so that plants that lag behind environmentally either invest in technological improvements or close. Figure 1.1 Municipal waste generation and treatment in Denmark between 2016 and 2020, in thousand tonnes Notes: Provisional data for 2020 Source: Eurostat (2022a) Legal Framework The main national regulations in the area of waste are the Environmental Protection Act (Miljø- og Fødevareministeriet, 2022) and the Statutory Order on Waste (Miljøministeriet, 2020b), defining principles, responsibilities and requirements on waste prevention and management in Denmark. The Statutory Order on waste regulations, fees and actors (Klima-, Energi- og Forsyningsministeriet, 2020) covers the treatment of waste that is not regulated by other legislation, the municipalities’ regulations on waste, schemes for waste, fees for waste, assignment of waste benchmarking of waste incineration plants. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency has issued guidelines for the sorting and collection of municipal waste from households (Miljøministeriet, 2020c, 2020d). Waste management plan(s) Denmark’s National Waste Management Plan (NWMP) Action plan for circular economy - National plan for prevention and management of waste 2020-2032 (Handlingsplan for cirkulær økonomi - National plan for forebyggelse og håndtering af affald 2020-2032) was adopted by the Danish Ministry of Environment (Miljøministeriet) in 2021 (Miljøministeriet, 2021a). The plan was drawn up largely based on previous strategies, agreements, plans and revised ordinances and can thus be seen as a consolidation of these. It will be reviewed at the latest after six years from its adoption. The NWMP covers all types of waste generated in Denmark also including commercial waste, sewage sludge, soil waste. The only exception is nuclear/radioactive waste. The NWMP covers the entire territory and is supplemented by municipal WMPs. According to the NWMP sorting and collection of household waste must be streamlined for ten types of household waste (food, paper, cardboard, metal, glass, plastic, textile and hazardous waste as well as food and beverage cartons and residual waste). These waste streams must be collected from households and common national sorting criteria for household waste must be used to create a basis for increased recycling with higher quality. The NWMP states that the Danish government expects to meet the 2025 and 2030 packaging waste recycling targets by implementing all measures included in the plan, with the exception of plastic. To increase plastics recycling, Denmark is launching a number of initiatives such as the ban of the marketing of certain disposable plastic products; a requirement to use 25 % recycled plastic in plastic bottles in 2025 and 30 % in 2030; a requirement of a minimum of 60 % real recycling of collected plastic waste from households by 2022 (Miljøministeriet, 2020b). Packaging waste generation and treatment In Denmark, 983 000 tonnes (169kg/cap) of packaging waste were generated in 2019, which is slightly below the EU average of 178 kg/cap. Packaging waste generation has been increasing, especially plastics packaging (Figure 1.2). Paper and cardboard packaging waste generation fluctuates at the level of approximately 67 kg/cap since 2010 (Eurostat, 2022b). Figure 1.2 Packaging waste generation in Denmark between 2010 and 2019, in kg per capita Note: Data for 2010 are estimated values for all packaging waste, and in 2011 there is a break in time series for metallic and glass packaging. Values for 2011 and 2012 are flagged as estimates for metallic and glass packaging. Source: Eurostat (2022b) Capture rates for recyclables The capture rate is a good performance indicator of the effectiveness of the separate collection system. The capture rate has been calculated for this report by dividing the separately collected weight of a certain municipal waste material by the estimated weight of the total amount of material in the municipal waste. The Danish EPA has provided calculations for the residual waste composition for municipal waste. Due to an expected difference in composition for recycling stations and households/non-households residual waste, amounts of materials present in the residual waste from these two sources were calculated separately. For Denmark the separate collection capture rates are presented in Table 1.1. Table 1.1 Capture rates for different waste fractions in Denmark Residual waste compo-sition (%)(a) Residual waste composition (tonnes)(b) Residual waste composition for recycling stations (%)(c) Residual waste composition for recycling stations (tonnes)(d) Separately collected amounts (tonnes) (e) Materials in total MSW (tonnes) Capture rates (%) Mixed municipal waste, total 1 858 138 136 709 Paper and cardboard 18 343 220 18 25 252 555 614 924 086 60 Metals 2 36 341 2 2 674 166 562 205 577 81 Glass 2 28 265 2 2 080 148 420 178 765 83 Plastic 10 193 298 10 14 222 75 331 282 851 27 Garden waste 1 13 612 1 1 367 948 750 963 730 98 Food waste 44 820 921 1 1 367 115 188 937 476 12 Textiles 2 40 379 5 6 835 1 203 48 418 2 Wood n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a Source: Miljøministeriet (2022) Notes: (a) Analysis of household residual waste and source-separated organic waste, 2018, the Danish EPA (Miljø- og Fødevareministeriet, 2017). The composition is calculated based on data from the report. (b) The composition of household and non-household municipal residual waste is assumed to be the same. The amount of mixed municipal waste is from Affaldsstatistik 2019 (Miljø- og Fødevareministeriet, 2020), excl. the amount from recycling stations. (c) For residual waste from recycling stations, the same composition from household residual waste was applied except for the share of food and textile waste. The composition is an estimate. (d) Provided by the Danish EPA (e) As reported in Affaldsstatistik 2019, Miljø- og Fødevareministeriet (2020) This indicates that there is some room for improvement to capture higher amounts of the generated food waste, plastics and textiles and to some extent also of paper and cardboard. Since 2017 more municipalities have increased the number of separately collected material which is expected to affect the composition of municipal residual waste, especially for food waste (Miljøministeriet, 2022). While a capture rate for WEEE can be calculated with the same method, it delivers unreliable outcomes as there are considerable invisible flows (Miljøministeriet, 2021b) that are not captured in the data. 2 Success and risk factors likely to influence future performance 2.1 Target for preparing for reuse and recycling of municipal waste This chapter aims at assessing the prospects of Denmark to achieve the 55 % preparing for reuse and recycling target for municipal waste in 2025. For a detailed description of the methodology followed, the development of success/risk factors and their impact on recycling, please consult the methodology report (ETC/CE & ETC/WMGE, 2022). 2.1.1 Current situation and past trends SRF MSWR-1.1: Distance to target The overall recycling rate of Denmark shows a steady increase mainly driven by increasing material recycling (Figure 2.1). In this analysis the recycling rate is calculated by dividing the summed amounts of recycling of materials and of composting and digestion by the total generated amounts. The data source used is the Eurostat data set Municipal waste by waste management operations [env_wasmun] (following the OECD/Eurostat Joint Questionnaire); Data reported by Member States according to Article 10.2(a) of the Waste Framework Directive are not used for this assessment as the reporting methods differ by Member State, resulting in a lack of comparability between Member States. The data source used here is assumed to be the best available proxy, given that data in accordance with the rules on the calculation of the attainment of the targets as defined in Article 11a are not yet available. Figure 2.1 Recycling rate in Denmark between 2016 and 2020, in percentage Source: Eurostat (2022a) The actual distance to the target for the most recent data point is a key factor determining the likelihood of meeting/not meeting the target. The closer the Member State is to the target already, the more likely it becomes that the target will be met. For Denmark, the rate of municipal waste collected for recycling is 53.9 % in 2020, which is close to the 55 % target for 2025 (Miljø- og Fødevareministeriet, 2020). However, the data used for this analysis is based on a different methodology than the calculation rules for the target. The Danish government has provisionally estimated the impact of the application of the new calculation rules on the recycling rates by accounting for average loss rates per waste type. The expected impact on the recycling rate for municipal waste is that the recycling rate would drop from 52 % to 44 % for 2019 (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2020). The same 8 percentage point decrease is applied to the latest available data (2020) in this assessment to calculate the actual distance to the target. The Danish government is working on a more precise way of calculating the recycling rate according to the new rules (Miljøministeriet, 2022). Summary result Distance to target 5 - 15 percentage points Based on the currently available data, Denmark’s recycling rate was 53.9 % in 2020, 1.1 percentage points below the 2025 target. Considering however, the application of the new calculation rules, an estimated decrease of the recycling rate by 8 percentage points is assumed, leading to an approximate recycling rate of 45.9 % or 9.1 percentage points below the target. Robustness of the underlying information The new calculation rules are likely to lead to lower calculated recycling levels. Based on calculations done by the Danish authorities, the recycling rate would drop by 8 percentage points. SRF MSWR-1.2: Past trend in municipal solid waste recycling rate The recycling rate over the last five years shows a steady increase of 5.6 percentage points from 2016 to 2020, mainly driven by increasing material recycling (Figure 2.1). This indicates that efforts have to be intensified compared to progress of the past few years. Summary result RR > 45%, and increase in last 5 years < 10 percentage points The recycling rate has increased with 5.6 percentage points. For Denmark the application of the new calculation rules would result in an estimated recycling rate of 45.9 %, based on estimates done by the Danish Environmental Protection Agency that the recycling rate would decrease by 8 percentage points. The pace of improvement needs to be speeded up to obtain the target. Robustness of the underlying information There are no breaks in the time series data. For 2019 the Danish Environmental Protection Agency estimated that the recycling rate would drop by 8 percentage points if the new calculation rules would be applied, this same rate is used for 2020 in this assessment. 2.1.2 Legal instruments SRF MSWR-2.1: Timely transposition of the revised Waste Framework Directive into national law Timely transposition of the Waste Framework Directive as amended by Directive 2018/851, into national law within the foreseen period is key for a waste management system in line with EU requirements. Denmark has transposed the amended Waste Framework Directive in its Act No 807 of 9 June 2020 and Act No 645 of 19 May 2020 amending the Environmental Protection Act. Furthermore, the requirements for separate collection and waste management are transposed in Order No 2159 of 9 December 2020, which has since been repealed and replaced by Order No 2512 of 10 December 2021. Summary result Transposition without delay Denmark has transposed the amended WFD into national law by the transposition deadline. Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the European Commission (status as of 12 November 2021). SRF MSWR-2.2: Responsibilities for meeting the targets, and support and enforcement mechanisms, e.g. tools, fines etc. Clearly defined responsibilities, enforcement and support mechanisms for meeting the targets across different entities and governance levels are important for achieving high recycling rates. The clearer the responsibilities for meeting the targets and the accountability for failing the targets are, the higher the chance that the targets will be met. The Ministry of Environment is responsible for preparing the national legislation related to waste management, including setting targets for preparation for re-use, recycling, or material recovery of municipal waste, as well as stating minimum requirements for the management of waste. The Danish Climate action plan for a green waste sector and a circular economy was adopted in June 2020, which agreed to streamline the collection of municipal waste, as well as changing the framework for the waste sector so that it supports less waste incineration and more recycling. Further, it was agreed in the same Plan to reduce the incineration capacity. Capacity must be reduced and adapted to the Danish waste volumes so that the available capacity is not filled up with imported waste. In order to address plastic waste, the Plan foresees setting up a system for collecting plastic waste in the public space by January 2025 at the latest, as part of the extended producer responsibility for packaging to be introduced in Denmark. The municipalities are responsible for collecting household waste and packaging waste as a part of household waste and have to ensure proper municipal waste management. It is defined in the Danish legislation, which types of waste the municipalities are obliged to collect separately and how the municipalities are to ensure proper waste management. The municipalities have to define minimum requirements for the collection of different waste fractions (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; Miljø- og Fødevareministeriet, 2019; Miljøministeriet, 2020b). The municipalities are required to separately collect ten different types of waste using high convenience collection systems (door-to-door or, for apartment blocks, in short walking distance): food, paper, cardboard, metal, glass, plastic, textile waste as well as beverage and food cartons, residual waste and hazardous waste. This requirement is implemented in national legislation and applies from 1 July 2021. However, a majority of municipalities have been granted an extension of the deadline until end of 2022 (Miljøministeriet, 2021a); for textile waste the deadline still has to be decided but will lie between 1 July 2023 and 1 January 2025. If the municipalities offer bulky waste schemes they are also required to sort the waste after collection in order to achieve a high recycling and reuse rate. Commercial producers of waste, including of municipal waste similar to household waste, are obliged to sort their waste at source into recyclable fractions, and to make sure that the recyclable fractions are used for material recovery (Miljøministeriet, 2020b). Municipalities can decide to organise collection of residual waste from commercial waste producers or oblige them to deliver the waste to certain waste facilities (Energistyrelsen, 2021). Municipalities are obliged to control the correct management of commercial waste via inspections (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021). Measures to achieve the targets are defined in the Circular Economy Action Plan – National plan for prevention and management of waste (Handlingsplan for cirkulær økonomi – National plan for forebyggelse og håndtering af affald 2020-2032). In addition, the municipalities are required by 1 January 2022 to set requirements for minimum 60 % recycling of the collected household plastic waste in their contracts with the waste collectors. The municipalities must furthermore ensure a high recycling rate of all separately collected recyclable types of waste, however, national legislation does not set quantitative targets for recycling for the municipalities to meet. The Danish deposit and return system (DRS) for beverage packaging is responsible for collection and recycling of disposable beverage packaging, not for the handling of refillable bottles. The DRS is regulated in the Order on Deposits (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; Miljøministeriet, 2020a). The Danish EPA supports the implementation of proper waste management in Denmark via communication and cooperation with municipalities. The EPA has published guidelines for waste management, aiming to streamline and improve waste collection and ensure increasing capture rates of recyclables in Denmark for both municipal waste and packaging waste (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021). Related to enforcement mechanisms, the National Board of Appeal is the supervising authority for the municipalities, supervising the compliance with national law. In the case of non-compliance, the Board can assign daily fines to the members of the municipal council as enforcement mechanism. (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021) Summary result Clearly defined responsibilities, enforcement and good set of support mechanisms for meeting the recycling targets Denmark reports clearly defined responsibilities, as well as clearly defined enforcement mechanisms for meeting the targets on recycling of municipal waste, in addition Denmark also presents support mechanisms to improve the implementation of the responsible entities. Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the Danish authorities through the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire 2.1.3 Economic instruments SRF MSW-3.1: Taxes and/or ban for landfilling residual- or biodegradable waste Bans and taxes on landfilling of residual municipal waste can help to discourage strong reliance on residual waste treatment and thus support recycling. Denmark has a landfill tax in place since 1987 of 475 DKK/t (about 63.3 EUR/t) before VAT (about 79 EUR/t VAT incl.). Since 1997, there is also a landfill ban on recyclable and combustible waste (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; Skatteministeriet, 2020). Summary result Ban in place for landfilling residual or biodegradable waste Denmark has a landfill ban, and a landfill tax of 79 EUR/t (corresponding to 56 EUR/t rescaled based on purchasing power parities(a)) Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the Danish authorities through the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire. (a) Note: Rescaled based on purchasing power parities Eurostat (2020a) SRF MSWR-3.2: Taxes on municipal waste incineration Taxes on incineration of residual municipal waste can help to discourage strong reliance on residual waste treatment and thus support recycling. Denmark has taxes on waste incineration via three different elements (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; SKAT (Danish Tax Authority), 2022; Miljøministeriet, 2022): • An incineration tax since 1999 that totals 52.5 DKK/GJ in 2022, consisting of: o A tax on heat generated from waste incineration (20.7 DKK/GJ), which is indexed annually with the net price index o An additional incineration tax (31.8 DKK/GJ), which is not indexed. • A CO2-tax since 2010 which is levied on incinerated non-biodegradable waste (179.2 DKK/tonne of CO2 emitted), which is indexed annually with the net price index. Due to the different tax bases for the three taxation elements, the taxes cannot easily be translated into a tax per tonne of waste. If an energy content of 10.6 GJ/tonne is assumed (Danish Ministry of the Environment, 2013), the incineration tax alone would be around 557 DKK/tonne, corresponding to 75 EUR/t. Summary result Taxes > 18 EUR/t(a) If an energy content of 10.6 GJ/tonne is assumed, the incineration tax alone would be about 75 EUR/t (corresponding to 53 EUR/t rescaled based on purchasing power parities). Furthermore, a CO2-tax is levied on incinerated non-biodegradable waste. Robustness of the underlying information The underlying information provided by the Danish authorities can be considered robust. The calculation of the total incineration tax rate is based on assumptions. (a) Note: Rescaled based on purchasing power parities Eurostat (2020a) SRF MSWR-3.3: Pay-as-you-throw (PAYT) system in place PAYT systems are designed to incentivize citizens to make a bigger effort in separating their waste at source. However, a PAYT system should be designed with the appropriate level of source separation encouragement to ensure that citizens do not misplace waste in recycling bins in order to avoid residual waste charges. Overall, PAYT usually has a positive effect on source separation and thus recycling rates through direct involvement of citizens. Denmark has a policy of full cost recovery for municipal waste collection which allows for the possibility of PAYT-schemes. As a principle, the fees for municipal waste management shall cover all costs related to the service. It is not allowed to cover cost for the service of collecting recyclables through the residual waste fee. The legal framework permits the use of PAYT by municipalities. Municipalities still often charge a flat rate for collection of both recyclables and residual waste, with some municipalities granting citizens a choice of the size of container, the larger container having a higher fee (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; Klima-, Energi- og Forsyningsministeriet, 2020). Recent information about the shares of the different systems is not available. A survey of Danish municipalities performed in 2015 indicated that container volume based fees and fees based on a combination of factors were dominant while there was very little use of weight based systems (Deloitte and Incentive, 2015). Summary result PAYT scheme implemented in some regions/ municipalities (50-80% of population covered) Denmark has a policy for municipal waste collection which allows for the possibility of PAYT-schemes but municipalities often do not implement PAYT. Robustness of the underlying information It is unclear how strong the economic incentive is for citizens to place waste in the bins for recyclables instead of in the bin for residual waste. Recent information about the shares of the different systems (volume based, frequency of collection, weight based) is not available. 2.1.4 Separate collection system SRF MSWR-4.1: Convenience and coverage of separate collection systems for the different household waste fractions Separate collection systems are a key enabler for high recycling rates and for collecting recyclables at adequate quality. Generally, the more convenient and accessible these systems are for their users, the better results they deliver. The assessment methodology categorises different types of collection systems (door-to-door, bring points with a density of > 5 per km2, bring points with a density of < 5 per km2, civic amenity site) for assessing the degree of convenience, and differentiates between cities (densely populated), towns and suburbs (intermediate densely populated) and rural (thinly populated areas). It then calculates which share of the population is served by which type of system. The assessment is done on a material basis and takes into account the different materials according to their average share in municipal waste. This is described in more detail in the methodology (ETC/CE & ETC/WMGE, 2022) For Denmark, according to the most recent data, the percentage of households living in cities is 32 %, in towns and suburbs 35 % and in rural areas 33 % (Eurostat, 2021a). In Denmark, there have been a large number of different waste sorting and collection schemes across the municipalities, resulting in a high variance in the collection schemes between municipalities. This changed in July 2021 with the implementation of the Climate action plan for a green waste sector and a circular economy (see next section), however, the majority of Danish municipalities have been granted an extension of the deadline to fully implement the new requirements until end of 2022. The use of co-mingled collection has been increasing (Eurostat, 2020b). The separate collection of food waste is today not covered by all municipalities (56 %) (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021). The municipalities are required to separately collect ten different types of waste through high convenience collection systems: food, paper, cardboard, metal, glass, plastic, textile waste as well as beverage and food cartons, residual waste and hazardous waste. The collection should be door-to-door if possible, with respect to the types of buildings/housing area. Depending on the type of areas a bring point can be used, that is located so it can be reached by foot. Thus, the type of schemes used will change over the next two years – since the deadline has been postponed for a number of municipalities. Both households and companies are obliged to sort their waste for separate collection. Municipalities can decide if companies can use the collection system organised by the municipality or if they should organise collection themselves or through contractors. However, municipalities are responsible for the inspection of commercial waste management (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; Miljøministeriet, 2020c). Table 2.1 gives an overview of the collection system in Denmark. The collection in Demark is material based and the collection systems do not distinguish between packaging and non-packaging waste. The Danish EPA publishes data about municipalities’ implementation of the requirements to collect ten different fractions separately (Miljøministeriet, 2021c). Table 2.1 Characterisation of the collection system in Denmark Cities (densely populated areas) Towns and suburbs (intermediate density areas) Rural areas (thinly populated areas) Door-to-door - separate Door-to-door - co-mingled Bring point (>5 per km²) Bring point (<5 per km²) Civic amenity site Door-to-door - separate Door-to-door - co-mingled Bring point (>5 per km²) Bring point (<5 per km²) Civic amenity site Door-to-door - separate Door-to-door - co-mingled Bring point Civic amenity site Residual waste xx x xx x xx x Paper and Cardboard xx x xx x x xx x xx x x xx x xx x Ferrous metals x x x x x x x x x x x Aluminium x x x x x x x x x x x Glass x x x x x x x X x x x x x x Plastic x x x x x x x x x x x Bio-waste food x x x x x x garden x x x x x x x x Textiles x (few) x x x x (few) x x x x (few) x x Wood x x x x x x x x x WEEE x x x x x x x x Composite packaging x(a) (few) x(a) (few) X(a) (few) Other: Hazardous waste x x (with WEEE) x x x x x (with WEEE) x x x x x (with WEEE) x x Note: xx: dominant system; x: other significant systems. Grey cells indicate high convenience collection systems. (a) Primo 2022, about 1.25 million people (23 % of the population) covered by separate collection of food and drink cartons Source: Danish Environmental Protection Agency (2021), Miljøministeriet (2021c) Taking this into account, Denmark uses a range of options for separate collection, with different services offered in different municipalities. Summary result Paper and cardboard A high share of the population is covered by high convenience collection services For paper and cardboard waste, different types of separate collection systems are used by the Danish municipalities but door-to-door separate collection and high-density bring points dominate. Metals A high share of the population is covered by high convenience collection services For metals waste, a large range of different types of separate collection systems are used by the Danish municipalities, except low-density bring points in urban areas and civic amenity sites in rural areas. Plastics A high share of the population is covered by high convenience collection services For plastic waste, a large range of different types of separate collection systems are used by the Danish municipalities, except low-density bring points in urban areas and civic amenity sites in rural areas. Glass A high share of the population is covered by high convenience collection services Denmark conducts all separate collection alternatives for the collection of glass waste. More than 70 % of the municipalities collect glass waste either by door-to-door collection or high-convenience bring points. Bio-waste A medium share of the population is covered by high convenience collection services Denmark conducts door-to-door and high density bring point collection for food and garden waste, but not yet in all municipalities. Garden waste is additionally collected at civic amenity sites. Improvements are expected by the end of 2022. Wood A high share of the population is covered by high convenience collection services Denmark conducts door-to-door and high density bring point collection for wood waste. This collection mainly refers to picking up bulky waste from households. Wood waste is additionally collected at civic amenity sites. Textiles A low share of the population is covered by high convenience collection services Denmark conducts bring point and civic amenity site collection with a small addition of co-mingled collection for textile waste. Reusable textiles are also collected by charities. WEEE High to medium convenience collection services dominate Denmark conducts door-to-door and high-density bring point collection for WEEE and additionally civic amenity site collection in urban areas. Many municipalities have introduced collection schemes for battery waste and small electronic waste, e.g. so that it is collected together with hazardous waste. Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the Danish authorities through the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire. Danish municipalities apply different types of separate collection systems for the different materials. However, no quantitative information is available for the coverage of each system. This means that the population coverages in this table are rough estimates. SRF MSWR-4.2: Firm plans to improve the convenience and coverage of separate collection for the different household waste fractions In the waste Law it is stated , that as of July 2021, with the option to apply for a derogation until 31 December 2022, all municipalities are obliged to arrange high convenience separate collection schemes for the following waste fractions (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; Miljøministeriet, 2020b): residual waste, paper, cardboard, metal, glass, plastic, food waste, textiles (between mid-2023 and 1 January 2025), composite packaging (food- and drink cartons) and hazardous waste. The municipalities can choose between door-to-door-separate collection or door-to-door-co-mingled collection (for certain combinations of materials). For glass as well as for all fractions in densely populated areas and from holiday cottages a bring point system in walking distance from the house is accepted. For the following fractions co-mingled collection will be allowed (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; Miljøministeriet, 2020d): paper/cardboard, metal/plastic, plastic/ composite packaging, metal/plastic/composite packaging and metal/glass. Today, reusable textiles are collected via charity organisations. The separate collection scheme for textile waste will be limited to textiles waste not suitable for reuse (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021). Together with the national harmonisation of the separate collection system, a harmonised pictogram and colour scheme is rolled out in order to improve the citizen’s understanding of the waste collection system across the country. It has been developed by the Danish Environmental Protection Agency, the Association of municipalities and the Danish Waste Association and is used or underway to be used by nearly all Danish municipalities (Danish Waste Association, 2021). As of 2023, non-household waste generators are obliged to sort their waste for separate collection similar to household waste for the same fractions as households with the same options regarding co-mingled fractions (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; Miljøministeriet, 2020c). It is important to note that non-household waste generators already are obliged to sort their waste and ensure proper waste management. But from 2023 they are obliged to sort municipal waste in the same way and use the same pictograms on the collection containers as municipalities shall for collection containers for household waste. Non-household waste generators are allowed to sort in more detailed fractions if it is suitable with regard to the specific waste generated. Summary result Paper and cardboard Firm plans to improve the separate collection system, with clear responsible entities and defined targets and timeline.

Textiles Firm plans to improve the separate collection system, with clear responsible entities and defined targets and timeline. Between 2023 and 2025, it will be required that all municipalities in Denmark are obliged to arrange separate collection schemes (door-to-door or high convenience bring points) WEEE N/A (for countries already covering > 80% of the population by high convenience collection services) No changes planned. Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the Danish authorities through the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire. The obligations for municipalities are set in the Danish legislation and explained in recommendations issued by the Danish EPA. 2.1.5 Extended producer responsibility (EPR) and similar schemes SRF MSWR-5.1: Fee modulation in EPR schemes for packaging Within EPR schemes, fee modulation (or eco-modulation) is a system with different fees for different types of packaging material and designs. While basic fee modulation, i.e. different fees for the main material groups, are common, advanced fee modulation can create stronger incentives for packaging producers to design for recycling and thus create favourable conditions for higher recycling rates. The level of advancement of the fee modulation is assessed against four criteria that have been selected as benchmarks for a well-designed eco-modulated fee system: • recyclability, for example differentiating between PET and PS, between different colours of PET, or between 100 % cardboard boxes and laminated beverage cartons; • sortability and disruptors, for example a malus for labels/caps/sleeves made of other materials, which are not fitted for the recycling technologies of the main packaging; • recycled content; and • if there is a transparent compliance check by the Producer Responsibility Organisation (PRO) that producers report correctly. Denmark has no general EPR scheme for packaging yet, instead Denmark has a comprehensive deposit return system for beverage packaging, also aiming at preventing free riding in relation to beverage packaging. The deposit return system is planned to continue and to operate in parallel with a new general EPR scheme for all other packaging, which is not covered by the deposit return system. The implementation process for setting up a general EPR scheme has started. A law that establishes the legal basis for a general EPR system for packaging in Denmark was passed by the Danish Government in June 2020. In March 2022, the organisation and administrative setup for the EPR system is still under discussion with political parties (Miljøministeriet, 2022). The EPR scheme for packaging will be introduced no later than 31 December 2024 and will include all types of packaging in all types of materials. While no EPR system and thus no fee modulation within EPR is currently in place for packaging, the Danish deposit return system (Dansk Retursystem) requires producers and importers of bottled and canned beverages to pay a quarterly fee for marketing beverages on which deposits are payable. The fees vary for each type of bottle or can, depending on the volume of the bottle or can and their recyclability. The fees are calculated each year based on the expenditure of Dansk Retursystem versus the income. The fees are required to solely reflect the exact costs of operating and administering an efficient deposit and return system (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021). Summary result No EPR scheme and no advanced fee modulation Denmark has no EPR scheme for packaging yet. Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the Danish authorities through the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire. 2.1.6 Treatment capacity for bio-waste SRF MSWR-6.1: Capacity for the treatment of bio-waste Bio-waste is the largest single waste material fraction in municipal waste, and adequate treatment capacity needs to be made available. As reported by the Danish authorities, the country’s separately collected bio-waste amounted to 1 336 000 tonnes in 2019, comprising of 353 000 tonnes of food waste collected from households, restaurants, catering, retail and food industry, and 983 000 tonnes of garden waste. 93 % of garden waste from households was collected for recycling (Miljø- og Fødevareministeriet, 2020). In 2019 882 000 tonnes municipal waste was collected for composting and digestion (Eurostat, 2021b). The Danish authorities estimate, based on current knowledge, that 75 % of garden waste collected for recycling undergoes recycling treatment, if accounting for average loss rates per waste type according to the new calculation rules. For food waste the estimate is 85 %. The Danish authorities do not report a specific available capacity for the treatment of bio-waste. The total generation of bio-waste within total municipal waste, including separately collected bio-waste and bio-waste present in the residual waste fraction, is estimated at 1 901 206 tonnes in 2017 (this is the sum of food waste and garden waste) (Table 1.1). As of July 2021 and by end of 2022 at the latest, all households should have collection of food waste, and from 31 December 2023 the municipalities are required to establish a separate collection scheme for garden waste from households. Bio-waste treatment will be privately organised and municipalities must tender the treatment of bio-waste. Municipalities unable to cover the capacity demand from the private sector may be granted exemption from the legal requirement to tender the treatment of bio-waste and allowed to arrange for treatment capacity themselves (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; Government of Denmark, 2020). Based on a survey of treatment installations and a calculation on the potential of food waste in Denmark, the Waste and Resource Network Denmark (DAKOFA, 2021) estimates that the current capacity for anaerobic digestion of food waste covers 72-87 % of the food waste potential (related to both food waste from households and the service sector). Based on the presented information, it is likely that the currently available capacity for the treatment of bio-waste is slightly below 80 % of the generated bio-waste, however, the municipalities have a clear mandate to either tender or create the additional capacity needed to close any capacity gap. Summary result Bio-waste capacity below 80% of generated municipal bio-waste but firm plans to close the gap The Danish authorities report that the required additional capacity demand for the treatment of bio-waste will be covered by the private sector or the municipalities. Robustness of the underlying information The information regarding available capacities is limited, and information is lacking on how the future capacity building will be implemented in practice. SRF MSWR-6.2: Legally binding national standards and Quality Management System for compost/digestate To create a market for compost and digestate, compost should be of a good quality for use as a soil improver or fertilizer. Legally binding standards provide guarantees regarding the quality of the compost/digestate produced. A quality management system aims at addressing different elements of a production process to ensure a stable and high-quality output (product) which helps toward reaching a defined quality for the product. Denmark has national standards for compost quality (EEA, 2020; Miljø- og Fødevareministeriet, 2018, 2008). Before the composting and/or biogas process, the bio-waste needs to comply with the limit values laid down in statutory order no. 1001 of the 27 June 2018 regarding the use of waste for agricultural purposes (Miljøministeriet, 2022). The Danish Agricultural Agency is in the process of implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1009 of the 5 June 2019 regarding laying down rules on the making available on the market of EU fertilising products. This regulation includes quality management systems and standards for compost quality (Miljøministeriet, 2022). Summary result Legally binding national standards for compost/digestate quality but no quality management system Denmark has legally binding national standards for compost quality. The bio- waste needs to comply with certain limit values before being used in a composting and/or biogas process. Robustness of the underlying information The information is based on legal standards. 2.2 Target for the recycling of packaging waste This chapter aims at assessing the prospects of Denmark to achieve the 65 % recycling target for packaging waste in 2025 as well as the material specific packaging waste recycling targets (50 % of plastic; 25 % of wood; 70 % of ferrous metals; 50 % of aluminium; 70 % of glass; 75 % of paper and cardboard). In order to conclude on this likelihood, the analysis takes stock of the status of several factors that are proven to influence the levels of recycling in a country. For a detailed description of the methodology followed, the development of success/risk factors and their impact on recycling, please consult the methodology report (ETC/CE & ETC/WMGE, 2022). 2.2.1 Current situation and past trends SRF P-1.1 Distance to target The actual distance to the target for the most recent data point is a key factor determining the likelihood of meeting or not meeting the target. This analysis is based on data reported by Denmark to Eurostat in accordance with Commission Decision 2005/270/EC as last amended by the Commission Implementing Decision 2019/665 (EC, 2019), published in the dataset Recycling rates of packaging waste for monitoring compliance with policy targets, by type of packaging [env_waspacr]. The latest available data refers to 2019. The performance of Denmark for 2019 is illustrated in Figure 2.2. Figure 2.2 Packaging recycling rates for Denmark in 2019, in percentage Note: No data available for ferrous and aluminium packaging, only for metallic packaging. Source: Eurostat (2022c), EU (2018) For Denmark the reported recycling rates exceed the targets for all packaging materials except of plastics packaging. For total packaging, the recycling exceeds the target by 5.4 percentage points, for paper and cardboard packaging by 22.7 percentage points, for glass by 1.1 percentage points, and for wooden packaging by 32.4 percentage points. For metals, the reported rates do not make a distinction between ferrous metals and aluminium, but the total recycling rate for metals (61.3 %) still exceeds the recycling target for aluminium, but not for ferrous metals. For plastics packaging, the reported recycling rate is 12.6 percentage points below the target (Eurostat, 2022c). However, the recycling rates presented are based on the calculation rules of the Commission Decision 2005/270 before it was amended by the Commission Implementing Decision 2019/665 and will likely differ from the recycling rates to be reported according to the new calculation rules. The new calculation rules will only be mandatory to be used for the reference year 2020 and onwards. A key difference in the new calculation rules compared to the old rules is that the amount of sorted packaging waste that is rejected by the recycling facility shall not be included in the reported amount of recycled packaging waste. Denmark has carried out a preliminary assessment of the impact of the new calculation rules. Currently, the reported data refer to packaging waste collected for recycling and the final recycling rate will refer to the output of recycling. The Danish government has estimated final recycling rates for the year 2018 by accounting for average loss rates per waste type (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021). If the same reduction in the rates (in percentage points) are used to calculate the impact of the new calculation rules to the reported data for the year 2019, the recycling rates would decrease as follows: • Paper and cardboard packaging waste by 3 per cent points from 99.7 % to 96.7 % • Metal packaging waste by 10 per cent points from 61.3 % to 51.3 % • Glass packaging waste by 3 per cent points from 71.1 % to 68.1 % • Plastic packaging waste by 17 per cent points from 37.4 % to 20.4 % • Wood packaging waste by 4 per cent points from 57.4 % to 53.4 % • Total packaging: Calculated based on the amounts of each packaging material generated and recycled in 2019, the recycling rate would drop from 70.4 % to 64.1 %. The waste generation data includes also privately imported packaging, and for plastics and paper/cardboard also estimates for online sales (Eurostat, 2020b). It is likely that the currently reported recycling rate of 99.7 % is overestimated for paper and cardboard packaging. The latest Danish composition analysis of mixed household waste (Miljøstyrelsen, 2018) found that 3.1 % of this waste was cardboard, corresponding to around 31 000 tonnes in 2017 (the same study reports the amount of mixed household waste to be 995 000 tonnes). If it is assumed that most of this cardboard is packaging, around 8 % of the generated paper and cardboard packaging would end up in mixed municipal waste. This estimate does not take into account municipal waste from non-households and paper packaging. Summary result Total packaging < 5 percentage points below target Denmark reports a recycling rate of 70.4 %. If the estimated loss rate provided by Denmark is applied (taking into account losses in the recycling plants), the estimated recycling rate would drop to 64.1 %, 0.9 percentage points below the 2025 target. Paper and cardboard packaging Target exceeded Denmark reports a recycling rate of 99.7 %. If the estimated loss rate provided by Denmark is applied (taking into account losses in the recycling plants), the estimated recycling rate would drop to 96.7 %, 21.7 percentage points above the 2025 target. Ferrous metals packaging > 15 percentage points below target Denmark reports a recycling rate of 61.3 % for total metals packaging. If the estimated loss rate provided by Denmark is applied (taking into account losses in the recycling plants), the estimated recycling rate would drop to 51.3 %, 18.7 percentage points below the target for steel and 1.3 percentage points above the target for aluminium. Aluminium packaging Target exceeded Glass packaging < 5 percentage points below targe Denmark reports a recycling rate of 71.1 %. If the estimated loss rate provided by Denmark is applied (taking into account losses in the recycling plants), the estimated recycling rate would drop to 68.1%, 1.9 percentage points below the 2025 target. Plastics packaging > 15 percentage points below target Denmark reports a recycling rate of 37.4 %. If the estimated loss rate provided by Denmark is applied (taking into account losses in the recycling plants), the estimated recycling rate would drop to 20.4 %, 29.6 percentage points below the 2025 target. Wooden packaging Target exceeded Denmark reports a recycling rate of 57.4 %. If the estimated loss rate provided by Denmark is applied (taking into account losses in the recycling plants), the estimated recycling rate would drop to 53.4 %, 28.4 percentage points above the 2025 target. Robustness of the underlying information The recycling rates used for the assessment referring to 2019 data are estimated, by applying the same reduction (in percentage points) as calculated by the Danish authorities for losses during sorting and recycling for the 2018 data in order to assess the impact of the new calculation rules on the currently reported recycling rates. Separate data for aluminium and ferrous metals packaging are not yet available. The 99.7 % recycling rate for paper and cardboard packaging is very high, indicating that not all generated paper and cardboard waste may be included in the waste generation data. Danish authorities indicate that the methodology for the data on amounts put on the market underestimates the amounts for paper and cardboard and overestimates the amounts for plastics packaging. SRF P-1.2: Past trend in Packaging Waste Recycling The development of the historical trend in the recycling rate indicates previous efforts towards packaging waste recycling. In this analysis the recycling rate reported in the Eurostat dataset Recycling rates of packaging waste for monitoring compliance with policy targets, by type of packaging [env_waspacr] (latest data year: 2019) is used. The recycling trends for packaging waste by material in Denmark are illustrated in Figure 2.3. Figure 2.3 Trend in packaging waste recycling rates in Denmark between 2015 and 2019, in percentage Source: Eurostat (2022c) The overall packaging recycling rate for the past five years started at 73.9 % in 2015, peaked at 79 % in 2016 and dropped to 70.4 % in 2019. The recycling rate of paper and cardboard packaging increased from 95.3 % in 2015 to 99.7 % in 2019. Plastic packaging increased from 30.5 % in 2015 to 37.4 % in 2019, while it peaked in 2017 at 41.8 %. The recycling rate of wooden packaging has plummeted; starting at 75.9 % in 2015 and peaking at 87.3 % in 2016, the recycling rate was 57.4% in 2019. The strong rise and drop in recycling of wooden packaging is influenced by the supply of and replacement of re-used wooden pallets and recycling activities may not take place the same year as waste generation (Eurostat, 2020b). The recycling rate of metallic packaging showed a decrease of 10.6 percentage points during the five years, and for glass packaging a decrease with 8.4 percentage points. (Eurostat, 2022c) The Danish calculation methodology for packaging waste generation is to be updated (Eurostat, 2020b), which may improve the data also on recycling rates. Summary result Total packaging RR > 60% and increase in last 5 years < 5 percentage points The recycling rate decreased by 3.5 percentage points over the past five years, and is estimated to be 64.1 % in 2019 applying the estimated loss rate provided by Denmark. Paper and cardboard packaging RR > 75% The recycling rate increased by 4.4 percentage points over the past five years, and is estimated to be 96.7 % in 2019 applying the estimated loss rate provided by Denmark. Ferrous metals packaging RR < 60% and increase in last 5 years < 10 percentage points The recycling rate decreased by 10.6 percentage points over the past five years, and is estimated to be 51.3 % in 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Percentage Packaging Paper and cardboard packaging Plastic packaging Wooden packaging Metallic packaging Glass packaging Aluminium packaging RR > 50% 2019 applying the estimated loss rate provided by Denmark. Glass packaging RR > 65% and increase in last 5 years < 5 percentage points The recycling rate decreased by 8.4 percentage points over the past five years, and is estimated to be 68.1 % in 2019 applying the estimated loss rate provided by Denmark. Plastics packaging RR < 40% and increase in last 5 years < 10 percentage points The recycling rate increased by 6.9 percentage points over the past five years, and is estimated to be 20.4 % in 2019 applying the estimated loss rate provided by Denmark. Wooden packaging RR > 25% The recycling rate decreased by 18.5 percentage points over the past five years, and is estimated to be 53.4 % in 2019 applying the estimated loss rate provided by Denmark. Robustness of the underlying information There are no breaks in the time series for 2015-2019 indicated in the dataset. The estimated recycling rates used for the assessment referring to 2019 data are estimated by applying the same reduction (in percentage points) as calculated by the Danish authorities for losses during sorting and recycling for the 2018 data in order to assess the impact of the new calculation rules on the currently reported recycling rates. Separate data for aluminium and ferrous metals packaging are not yet available. 2.2.2 Legal instruments SRF P-2.1: Timely transposition of the revised Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive into national law Timely transposition of the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive as amended by Directive 2018/852, into national law within the foreseen period is key for a waste management system in line with EU requirements. Summary result Transposition without delay Denmark has transposed the amended Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive into national law by the transposition deadline. Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the European Commission (status as of 12 November 2021). SRF P-2.2: Responsibilities for meeting the targets, and enforcement mechanisms, e.g. fines etc. As described in Section 2.1.2, the current responsibilities, enforcement mechanisms and support tools for meeting the targets are well defined. Packaging waste is under the same administration as municipal waste. However, the implementation process for setting up a general EPR scheme has started (see Section 2.1.5), with the aim to transfer the responsibility for packaging recycling to the producers. The EPR scheme for packaging will be introduced no later than 31 December 2024 and will include all types of packaging in all types of materials. Decisions about the organisation and administrative setup for the EPR system have not yet been made and thus forthcoming responsibilities for meeting the packaging waste targets in Denmark are not fully defined. Summary result Unclear responsibilities, weak/no enforcement mechanisms and lack of support tools for meeting the recycling targets Denmark has planned to implement an EPR scheme for packaging waste by the end of 2024, but the configuration of the scheme, enforcement and support mechanisms are not yet defined. Robustness of the underlying information Reliable information provided by the Danish authorities in the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire. The implementation process for setting up an EPR scheme for packaging in Denmark has started but decisions about the organisation and administrative setup for the EPR system have not yet been made and thus forthcoming responsibilities are not fully defined. 2.2.3 Economic instruments SRF P-3.1: Taxes and/or ban for landfilling residual- or biodegradable waste Bans and taxes on landfilling of residual waste can help to discourage landfilling and thus support recycling, also of packaging waste. As described in Section 2.1.3 in more detail, Denmark has a landfill tax and a landfill ban in place. Summary result Ban in place for landfilling residual or biodegradable waste Denmark has a landfill ban in place Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the Danish authorities through the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire. SRF P-3.2: Taxes on municipal waste incineration Taxes on incineration of residual waste can help to discourage strong reliance on residual waste treatment and thus support recycling. As described in Section 2.1.3 in more detail, Denmark has an incineration tax in place annually adjusted by the net price index. Summary result Taxes > 18 EUR/t(a) If an energy content of 10.6 GJ/tonne is assumed, the incineration tax alone would be about 75 EUR/t (corresponding to 53 EUR/t rescaled based on purchasing power parities). Furthermore, a CO2-tax is levied on incinerated of non-biodegradable waste. Robustness of the underlying information The underlying information provided by the Danish authorities can be considered robust. The calculation of the total incineration tax rate is based on assumptions. (a) Note: Rescaled based on purchasing power parities Eurostat (2020a) SRF P-3.3: Packaging taxes Packaging taxes can support the aim to reduce packaging waste generation and/or to influence the choice of packaging materials and encourage recyclability and eco-design. According to the information available, Denmark implements packaging taxes with an escalator (taxes on packaging, bags and disposable tableware are indexed with 5.5 % in 2024), as presented in Table 2.2. The packaging taxes focus on beverage packaging (excl. dairy), PVC films for food, bags and disposable tableware. Packaging that is included in the deposit return scheme is exempted from the packaging taxes. Table 2.2 Packaging taxes in Denmark in 2021; DKK per kg and DKK per item.

Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the Danish authorities through the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire. SRF P-3.4: Pay-as-you-throw (PAYT) system in place As a large share of packaging waste is generated in households, incentivising households to separate packaging waste at source, e.g. by applying PAYT systems, is relevant for meeting the recycling targets for packaging waste. As described in Section 2.1.3 in more detail, Denmark has a policy for municipal waste collection which allows for the possibility of PAYT-schemes but municipalities often do not implement PAYT. Summary result PAYT scheme implemented in some regions/ municipalities (50-80% of population covered) Denmark has a policy for municipal waste collection which allows for the possibility of PAYT-schemes but municipalities often do not implement PAYT Robustness of the underlying information It is unclear how strong the economic incentive is for citizens to place waste in the bins for recyclables instead of in the bin for residual waste. Recent information about the shares of the different systems (volume based, frequency of collection, weight based) is not available. SRF P-3.5: Deposit return systems Deposit Return Systems (DRS) generate high capture rates for packaging covered by the system and thus contribute to increased recycling rates. The Danish Deposit and return scheme is regulated in the Statutory Order on Deposits. Dansk Retursystem A/S runs the deposit and return scheme in Denmark. Requirements on the targeted return percentage is agreed between the Danish Ministry of Environment and DRS. The Danish DRS covers the following packaging (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; Miljøministeriet, 2020a): • Beer; • Carbonated beverages (such as soft drinks with an alcohol content of 0–0.5 %); • Other fermented drink products (such as cider with an alcohol content of less than 10 %); • Mixer products in which spirits, wine or other fermented products are mixed with other beverages such as soft drinks, cider or juice (such as alcoholic soft drinks with alcohol content exceeding 0.5 % but not exceeding 10 %); • Mineral water, water, lemonade, iced tea and similar products that are non-carbonated and ready to drink; • Concentrated cordial intended to be diluted before it is consumed; • Pure juice of fruits and vegetables; • Smoothies (without milk). Summary result Aluminium drink cans Mandatory DRS for nearly all drink cans The mandatory system covers nearly all drink cans (see above list) Glass drink bottles Mandatory DRS for nearly all drink bottles The mandatory system covers nearly all drink glass bottles (see above list) Plastic drink bottles Mandatory DRS for nearly all drink bottles The mandatory system covers nearly all plastic bottles (see above list) Plastic crates Voluntary DRS for some specific plastic crates The voluntary system covers some specific plastic crates for beers and sodas Wooden packaging No DRS for wooden packaging Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the Danish authorities through the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire. 2.2.4 Separate collection system SRF P-4.1: Convenience and coverage of separate collection for different packaging waste fractions As a large part of packaging waste comes from households, separate collection systems for households and similar sources are a key condition for high recycling rates for packaging waste and for collecting recyclables at adequate quality. Such systems generally deliver better results the more convenient and accessible they are for their users, also compared to the collection of residual waste. The material specific assessment considers packaging waste from both household and non-household sources. For assessing the convenience and coverage of separate collection systems for households, the same methodology is used here as described in section 2.1.4. As described in Section 2.1.4 in more detail, separate collection is mandatory in Denmark for both households and companies (non-households). Summary result Paper and cardboard packaging 1. Packaging waste from households A high share of the population is covered by high convenience collection services Danish municipalities apply different separate collection schemes for the collection of paper and cardboard waste, but door-to-door separate collection and high-density bring points dominate. 2. Packaging waste from non-household sources Separation at source is mandatory for non-household paper and cardboard packaging waste Separation at source is mandatory in Denmark for companies Ferrous metals packaging 1. Packaging waste from households A high share of population is covered by high convenience collection services Denmark applies all separate collection alternatives for the collection of metals, except low-density bring points in urban areas and civic amenity sites in rural areas. 2. Packaging waste from non-household sources Separation at source is mandatory for non-household ferrous metals packaging waste Separation at source is mandatory in Denmark for companies Aluminium packaging Packaging waste from households A high share of population is covered by high convenience collection services Denmark applies all separate collection alternatives for the collection of metals, except low-density bring points in urban areas and civic amenity sites in rural areas. Plastics packaging 1. Packaging waste from households A high share of population is covered by high convenience collection services Denmark applies all separate collection alternatives for the collection of plastics, except low-density bring points in urban areas and civic amenity sites in rural areas. 2. Packaging waste from non-household sources Separation at source is mandatory for non-household plastic packaging waste Separation at source is mandatory in Denmark for companies Glass packaging 1. Packaging waste from households A high share of the population is covered by high convenience collection services Denmark applies all separate collection alternatives for the collection of glass waste. More than 70 % of the municipalities either have door-to-door collection services or collect glass in cubes within walking distance of the household. 2. Packaging waste from non-household sources Separation at source is mandatory for non-household glass packaging waste Separation at source is mandatory in Denmark for companies Wooden packaging Packaging waste from non-household sources Separation at source is mandatory for non-household wooden packaging waste Separation at source is mandatory in Denmark for companies Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the Danish authorities through the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire. Quantitative information on the shares of the population covered by the different systems is not available. Note: The main source for aluminium packaging waste is drink cans from households, therefore the assessment does not consider aluminium non-household waste. SRF P-4.2: Firm plans to improve the convenience of separate collection for the different packaging waste fractions Concrete plans are needed to improve the convenience and coverage of separate collection. This SRF is only relevant for MS and materials that do not score ‘green’ in SRF P-4.1. The assessment is done on a material basis, and summing up the scores of the different materials according to their average share in packaging waste1. Again, the material specific assessment considers packaging waste from both household and non-household sources. As described in Section 2.1.4 in more detail, as of July 2021 all municipalities in Denmark are obliged to arrange unified separate collection schemes. The collection should be door-to-door if possible with respect to the types of buildings/housing area. Depending on the population density, also high-density bring points can be used. 1 Based on data from Eurostat on the share of packaging materials in total packaging generated in 2018 Summary result Paper and cardboard packaging 1. Packaging waste from households Firm plans to improve the separate collection system, with clear responsible entities and defined targets and timeline. By end of 2022 at the latest, all municipalities in Denmark are obliged to arrange separate collection schemes with a high service level. 2. Packaging waste from non-household sources N/A (for countries already implementing mandatory sorting at source for non-household ferrous metals packaging waste) Ferrous metals packaging 1. Packaging waste from households Firm plans to improve the separate collection system, with clear responsible entities and defined targets and timeline. By end of 2022 at the latest, all municipalities in Denmark are obliged to arrange separate collection schemes with a high service level. 2. Packaging waste from non-household sources N/A (for countries already implementing mandatory sorting at source for non-household paper and cardboard packaging waste) Aluminium packaging Packaging waste from household sources N/A (for countries already covering > 80% of the population by high convenience points) Glass packaging 1.

Packaging waste from households Firm plans to improve the separate collection system, with clear responsible entities and defined targets and timeline. By end of 2022 at the latest, all municipalities in Denmark are obliged to arrange separate collection schemes with a high service level. 2. Packaging waste from non-household sources N/A (for countries already implementing mandatory sorting at source for non-household plastic packaging waste) Wooden packaging Packaging waste from non-household sources N/A (for countries already implementing mandatory sorting at source for non-household wooden packaging waste) Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the Danish authorities through the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire. 2.2.5 Extended producer responsibility (EPR) and similar schemes SRF P-5.1: Coverage of EPR schemes As described in Section 2.1.5 in more detail, Denmark has no general EPR schemes for packaging yet but only a deposit-return system for beverage packaging as described in section 2.1.5. Summary result Not all main packaging fractions(a) are covered by EPR schemes Denmark has no EPR scheme for all packaging yet. Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the Danish authorities through the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire. (a) Note: Paper and cardboard, Ferrous metals, Aluminium, Glass, Plastic SRF P-5.2: Fee modulation in EPR schemes for packaging As explained in Section 2.1.5, fee modulation (or eco-modulation) is a system with different fees for different types of packaging material and designs. The assessment is the same as described in Section 2.1.5 Summary result No EPR scheme and no advanced fee modulation. Denmark has no EPR scheme for all packaging yet, and thus no fee modulation. Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the Danish authorities through the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire. SRF P-5.3 Material specific EPR assessment The material specific assessment is based on a combination of the coverage of the material specific EPR schemes and the use of fee modulation for the specific packaging material. The assessment takes the different situations for different types of materials into account: Plastics packaging is the packaging material that is the most difficult to recycle out of the packaging materials targeted by the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive. Fee modulation therefore plays a larger role for plastic packaging than for the other materials and is therefore rated differently from paper/cardboard, ferrous metals, aluminium and glass. The methodology foresees a green score for plastics packaging only if all four fee modulation assessment criteria mentioned above are met. On the other hand, wooden packaging is mainly generated by commercial and industrial sources and fee modulation is less relevant, therefore the methodology only relies on EPR schemes for wooden packaging from commercial and industrial sources. As described in Section 2.1.5 in more detail, Denmark has no EPR schemes for packaging waste yet. Denmark has a deposit return system for beverage packaging made of plastic, glass or aluminium which operates similar to an EPR scheme as described above. Summary result SRF P-5.3.1 EPR scheme for Paper and cardboard packaging waste No EPR scheme Denmark has no EPR schemes yet. SRF P-5.3.2 EPR scheme for Ferrous metals packaging waste No EPR scheme Denmark has no EPR schemes yet. SRF P-5.3.3 EPR scheme for Aluminium packaging waste No EPR scheme Denmark has no EPR schemes yet. SRF P-5.3.4 EPR scheme for Glass packaging waste No EPR scheme Denmark has no EPR schemes yet. SRF P-5.3.5 EPR scheme for Plastic packaging waste No EPR scheme Denmark has no EPR schemes yet. SRF P-5.3.6 EPR scheme for Wooden packaging waste No EPR scheme Denmark has no EPR schemes yet. Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the Danish authorities through the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire. 34 2.3 Target on landfill of municipal waste 2.3.1 Current situation and past trends SRF LF-1.1: Distance to target The Landfill Directive (1999/31/EC), as amended by Directive (EU) 2018/850, sets a target to reduce, by 2035, the amount of municipal waste landfilled to 10 % or less of the total amount of municipal waste generated (by weight). Data to show the current rate of landfilling in line with the reporting rules will only be reported by mid-2022. Therefore, this analysis calculates the landfilling rate based on the current Eurostat dataset Municipal waste by waste management operations [env_wasmun]; by dividing the amount of landfilled waste by the total amount of waste generated. The overall landfilling rate of Denmark was 0.9 % in 2020 (Eurostat, 2022a) . Denmark has a very high incineration capacity, roughly double the amount of municipal waste sent to incineration, and thus landfill rates are expected to stay at a low level also in the future (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021). Summary result Target exceeded The landfilling rate of Denmark was slightly below 1 % in 2020. Robustness of the underlying information The data is derived from Eurostat and is considered to be rather robust. However, the reported landfill rate might increase once the new calculation rules laid down in the Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/1885 will be applied. Based on the available information, it is currently not possible to quantify the impact of the new calculation rules on the landfill rate. SRF LF-1.2: Past trend in municipal solid waste landfill rate Over the past five years, the overall landfilling rate of Denmark has remained steady at about 1 % (Figure 2.4). Figure 2.4 Landfilling in Denmark between 2015 and 2020, in percentage Source: Eurostat (2022a) Summary result Landfill rate < 10% The landfill rate of Denmark was about 1 % throughout the period 2016 to 2020. Robustness of the underlying information The data is derived from Eurostat and is considered to be rather robust. There is no break in the time series data. SRF LF-1.3: Diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from landfill According to Art. 5(2c) of the EU Landfill Directive, Member States had to ensure that by 2016, biodegradable municipal waste going to landfills is reduced to 35 % of the total amount (by weight) of biodegradable municipal waste produced in 1995 or the latest year before 1995 for which standardised Eurostat data is available. Denmark reported 0 % biodegradable waste landfilled in 2019 as share of the biodegradable waste generated in 1995, and performs therefore well within the target (EC, 2021). Summary result Target for reducing the amount of biodegradable municipal waste (BMW) landfilled to 35% of BMW generated in 1995 has been achieved in 2016 Denmark has reported 0 % biodegradable waste landfilled in 2019 as share of the biodegradable waste generated in 1995 and performs therefore well within the target. Robustness of the underlying information Based on officially reported data which is well in line with otherwise reported statistical data on landfilling of municipal waste. 3 Conclusion This risk assessment indicates whether Denmark at risk of not meeting the targets. The ‘total risk’ categorization is the result of the sum of the individual scores of each SRF as described in the previous chapter, where the assessment of each SRF results in a score of 2 points (green), 1 point (amber) or 0 points (red), depending on the assessment of the SRF. As some SRFs are considered to have a higher impact on meeting the target, the score of the SRF is multiplied by the defined weight of the SRF. As some SRFs might not be applicable to Denmark, only the SRFs relevant to Denmark are taken into account to define the maximum score. Denmark is considered to be ‘not at risk’ if its score is more than 50 % of this maximum score, and ‘at risk’ if its score is less than 50 % of this maximum score. 3.1 Prospects for meeting the recycling target for municipal solid waste 65 % of maximum score Based on the provided information and the analysis done, it is concluded that Denmark is not at risk for not meeting the municipal waste recycling target in 2025. Current situation and past trends: The recycling rate was at 53.9 % in 2020, which is 1.1 percentage points below the 2025 target. Considering, however, the impact of the new calculation rules, Denmark has estimated the impact of the application of the new calculation rules on the recycling rate, with the result that the recycling rate would drop by 8 percentage points, to 45.9 %, or 9.1 percentage points below the target. Denmark has an increasing trend in recycling; the recycling rate has increased with 5.6 percentage points during the past five years. Legal instruments: The amended WFD has been transposed into national law in Denmark by the transposition deadline. Denmark reports clearly defined responsibilities, as well as clearly defined enforcement mechanisms for meeting the targets on recycling of municipal waste, in addition Denmark also presents support mechanisms to improve the implementation of the responsible entities. Economic instruments: There is a landfill ban for biodegradable waste and high taxes on both landfilling and incineration. Denmark has a policy for municipal waste collection which allows for the possibility of PAYT-schemes but municipalities often do not implement PAYT. Separate collection systems: A high share of population is covered by high convenience collection services for paper and cardboard, metals, wood, glass, plastics and WEEE. A medium share of population is covered by high convenience collection services for bio-waste. A low share of population is covered by high convenience collection services for textiles. By the end of 2022 at the latest, high convenience separate collection of all examined fractions except wood waste and WEEE will be mandatory in all municipalities in Denmark, which will improve the service level and can be expected to increase the capture rates of recyclables and recycling rates. Extended producer responsibility: The implementation process for setting up an EPR scheme has started. The implementation of an EPR scheme, covering all main packaging materials, is expected to have a positive impact on the separate collection of packaging waste which will, in turn, also impact the capture rates and recycling of municipal waste. Bio-waste treatment capacity and quality management: Increasing the bio-waste treatment capacity is required in order to meet the increasing volumes of separately collected bio-waste. The Danish authorities report the required capacity demand for the treatment of biowaste will be covered by the private sector or the municipalities. Denmark has legally binding national standards for compost quality, but no quality management system yet. 3.2 Prospects for meeting the recycling targets for packaging waste 76 % of maximum score Based on the provided information and the analysis done, it is concluded that Denmark is not at risk for not meeting the 65 % recycling target for packaging waste in 2025 84 % of maximum score Paper and cardboard Not at risk 45 % of maximum score Ferrous metals packaging At risk 84 % of maximum score Aluminium packaging Not at risk 82 % of maximum score Glass packaging Not at risk 46 % of maximum score Plastics packaging At risk 78 % of maximum score Wooden packaging Not at risk Current situation and past trends: The total packaging recycling rate (applying the new calculation rules) in 2019 was 64.1 %, 0.9 percentage points below the 2025 target. There was a small trend of decreasing recycling rates for the period 2015-2019, and the recycling rate in 2019 was lower than in 2015. Plastics and ferrous packaging waste is more than 15 percentage points below the target, once losses during sorting and recycling are taken into account. One of the main reasons for the poor performance on plastics packaging might be that plastics sorting at source is still new to Danish citizens. Legal instruments: The amended Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive has been transposed into national law. Responsibilities for meeting the packaging waste targets are planned to change with the introduction of EPR for packaging, however the organisational set-up for the EPR scheme for packaging is to be decided, and enforcement and support mechanisms are therefore not yet clear. Economic instruments: There is a landfill ban for biodegradable waste and a high tax on incineration. Denmark applies taxes on packaging. There is a policy for municipal waste collection which allows for the possibility of PAYT-schemes but municipalities often do not implement PAYT. Denmark has a mandatory DRS is in place for all aluminium cans, plastic and glass bottles and a voluntary DRS for some specific plastic crates. There is no DRS for wooden packaging. Separate collection systems: As of July 2021 and by end of 2022 at the latest, door-to-door or high convenience bring point separate collection of all packaging materials except wood waste will be mandatory in all municipalities in Denmark, aiming to further improve the service level and increase the collection rates for packaging waste. The need for improvement and introduction of additional mandatory separate collection requirements are a sign of the data on rate of collection for recycling for paper and cardboard not being accurate, indicating also that the data for other packaging waste recycling may not be robust. Separation at source is mandatory in Denmark for both households and also for companies. Extended producer responsibility: Denmark does not have an EPR scheme for packaging yet. Denmark has a deposit return system covering beverage packaging, which operates similar to an EPR-scheme. The process for setting up an EPR scheme for all packaging has started and it is intended to be introduced no later than 31 December 2024. It will cover all types of packaging in all types of materials. 3.3 Prospects of meeting the landfill of municipal waste target 100 % of maximum score Based on the provided information and the analysis done, it is concluded that Denmark is not at risk for not meeting the 2035 target to reduce the amount of municipal waste landfilled to 10 % or less of the total amount of municipal waste generated. Current situation and past trends: The landfilling rate in 2020 was 0.9 %. Over the past five years, the overall landfilling rate of Denmark was about 1 %. Keeping the low landfilling rate should be no problem due to the high incineration capacity in Denmark. Diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from landfill: Denmark reported 0 % biodegradable waste landfilled in 2019 in as share of the biodegradable waste generated in 1995, and performs therefore well within the target.

Development process of the programme/ revision The Danish Government's Action Plan for Circular Economy constitutes the national plan for the prevention and management of waste for 2020-2032. The action plan was drafted in 2020 and sent for consultation in December 2020. The final plan was published June 2021. The Action Plan for Circular Economy describes the Danish targets, indicators, policies and initiatives in the entire circular value chain, which ranges from design and consumption to waste management, from which natural resources are recycled into new products and materials. 9. Foreseen budget for implementation of the project No specific budget for the implementation of the programme is included in the programme. WASTE GENERATION The following figures illustrate the progress towards waste prevention and decoupling of waste generation from economic growth in Denmark: MSW • The generation of municipal waste per capita (see Figure 1) increased from 740 kg per capita in 2006 and reached its maximum in 2011 with 862 kg per capita. The trend stagnated after 2011 and 2012-2019 waste generation has remained on the same level 810-840 kg/capita and year, and in 2020 this dropped somewhat to 814 kg. Denmark’s waste generation is thereby one of the highest in Europe, compared to the 2020 per capita European average of 517 kg1. • The first WPP of Denmark came into force in 2013 and, although MSW generation is influenced by many factors (e.g. household expenditure), the prevention measures in that WPP might partially explain the stable trend in waste generation. To note is that household expenditure increased steadily during the same period2, thus some decoupling effect may have occurred. Figure 1: Municipal waste generation in Denmark (kg per capita), 2006-2020 (data unavailable in 2010) Source: Eurostat [ENV_WASMUN] Total waste • Denmark´s waste generation (excluding major mineral wastes) has fluctuated from 2010 to 2020 but decreased overall by 4% (see Figure 2). During the same period, Denmark’s GDP grew steadily. • Although a longer time series is needed to solidify a decoupling conclusion, Denmark seems to be on track to decouple total waste (excluding major mineral wastes) generation from economic growth since 2010. • There may be slight decoupling between total waste (excluding major mineral wastes) generation and population growth, which grew slowly during the same period 2010-2020. 1 Based on data collected from Eurostat in September 2022. 2 https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.CON.PRVT.PP.KD?end=2019&locations=DK&start=2012 650 700 750 800 850 900 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 WPP • Based on the figure, one cannot notice a clear immediate impact of Denmark’s first waste prevention programme (2013- ) on total waste generation. The total waste (excluding major mineral wastes) generation is however lower in 2018 compared to 2010.

Waste prevention objectives of the Programme - quantitative objectives (waste reduction) - qualitative objectives (reduction of hazardous substances/ environmental impacts) The Danish Government is committed to ensure less waste and better use of natural resources by e.g.: • Strengthen efforts to include circular economy in EU eco-design regulations • Introduce mandatory use of ecolabels in state procurement • decreasing the level of limescale in drinking water (leading to, among others extended durability for electronics and reduced consumption of cleaning agents) • Introduce mandatory use of total cost of ownership in state procurement • Create a clear framework for municipal second-hand shops 2. Sectors covered the Action Plan for Circular Economy focuses on three areas with significant environmental and climate impact: • biomass, • construction and • plastics 3. Priority waste types • biomass, • construction and • plastics 4. Target groups The programme focuses on possible measures by public institutions, industry and households Targets, indicators and monitoring 1. Indicators proposed Denmark’s action plan for circular economy includes a number of indicators of which the following address waste prevention: • Total waste sector CO2e emission (mil. tonnes) • Less waste and better use of natural resources • Municipal waste per capita (kg) • Material footprint (RMC per capita) (tonnes) • Resource productivity (BNP/RMC) (DKK per kg) • Number of products and services with Nordic Swan Ecolabel • Turnover of products and services with Nordic Swan Ecolabel (billion DKK) • Circular material use rate (recycling and mate-rial recovery compared to DMC) • Climate footprint of public procurement (mill. tons CO2e) • Significantly reduce the amount of marine waste • Reduce the amount of food waste in all parts of the food value chain • Reduce the environmental impact from construction and demolition o Proportion of constructions certified with the Nordic Swan Ecolabel, DGNB, LEED or BREEAM • Reduce consumption and improve reuse and recycling of plastics o Amount of marketed plastic packaging (1000 tonnes) o Amount of certain types of single-use products (tonnes) o Separate collection of plastic bottles 2. Quantitative targets Targets are set in accordance with EU target e.g. • halving food waste generation until 2030, based on the SDG • Separate collection of plastic bottles >70 % in 2025 >90 % in 2029 3. Monitoring of programme • waste intensity will be monitored based on annual reports by the German statistical office • share of reusable packaging is monitored by annual reports due to the German packaging law 4. Evaluation of the programme The implementation of the programme will be evaluated after six years. Based on the annual monitoring of the above outlined indicators, additional measures might be introduced in order to fulfil the indicated targets. Prevention measures Implemented prevention measures according to Article 9 Table 1: Specific waste prevention measures structured according to Art 9 WFD Promote and support sustainable consumption models • Quality standards for green procurement and training in green procurement is developed (2021- ). • All public procurement must be eco-labeled by 2030. Encourage the design, manufacturing and use of products that are resource-efficient, durable (including in terms of life span and absence of planned obsolence), reparable, re-usable and upgradable. • A guide for design of reusable packaging was published on a multistakeholder platform in 2019 (plast.dk) • All public procurement to include total cost of ownership criteria. Target products containing critical raw materials to prevent that those materials become waste. • Denmark has set targets for separate collection of batteries, > 45% and waste electronics, > 65%. • The EPR organisation Elretur has established an experience exchange forum for municipalities and waste companies that either already work towards reuse in the field of electronics or aspire to it. • A major part of municipal waste centers organizes C2C exchange of used electronic good or make them available in their thrift shops3. Encourage the re-use of products and the setting up of systems promoting repair and re-use activities, including in particular for electrical and electronic equipment, textiles and furniture, as well as packaging and construction materials and products. • Analysis on whether a reduced VAT rate for repair activities und second hand products can be implemented. • The government will continue informing about options and benefits of reuse. • Donations for reuse will be deductible for tax purposes. • Collection of electronic products will be improved in order to support reuse; also cooperations with local reuse networks. • circle house project. Encourage, as appropriate and without prejudice to intellectual property rights , the availability of spare parts, instruction manuals, technical information, or other instruments, equipment or software enabling the repair and re-use of products without compromising their quality and safety. • Quality standards for second hand products as well as legal liabilities will be harmonized. • The government is committed to strengthen its efforts to include circular economy in EU eco-design regulations 3 https://www2.mst.dk/Udgiv/publikationer/2020/01/978-87-7038-158-1.pdf Reduce waste generation in processes related to industrial production, extraction of minerals, manufacturing, construction and demolition, taking into account best available techniques. • Denmark’s circular action plan’s one key sector is construction. • The government is committed to update the Building Regulations with elements from the voluntary sustainability class and introduce increasing limit values for climate footprint from buildings. It will also introduce requirements for standardised demolition plans. • Exchange platforms for construction elements and materials will be supported. • A specific obligation to explore prevention potentials in construction projects will be evaluated. • Modular construction enabling reuse of construction elements is piloted in the Circle House project.4 Reduce the generation of food waste in primary production, in processing and manufacturing, in retail and other distribution of food, in restaurants and food services as well as in households as a contribution to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal to reduce by 50 % per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and to reduce food losses along production and supply chains by 2030. • The national strategy on food waste prevention will be implemented and further developed. • ONE\\THIRD, a think tank operating as an independent organization under the Danish Ministry of Environment is managing ’Denmark against food waste’, a voluntary agreement that unites 25+ food producers and retailers behind the shared mission to halve food waste by 2030. The members of the voluntary agreement co-develop a methodology and metrics to measure food waste reliably that is t ested. ONE\\THIRD publishes a yearly report on general progress on preventing food waste and loss in Denmark. • Other governmental actions include provision of professional assistance to reduce food waste in retail. Encourage food donation and other redistribution for human consumption, prioritising human use over animal feed and the reprocessing into non-food products. • Options to support food donations will be developed in a specific working group with the federal states • A study on legal options to support food donations will be prepared. • Legal risks and liabilities for food donations will be minimized wherever possible. Promote the reduction of the content of hazardous substances in materials and products, without prejudice to harmonised legal requirements concerning those materials and products laid down at Union level, and ensure that any supplier of an article as defined in point 33 of Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council provides the information pursuant to article 33(1) of that regulation to the European Chemicals Agency as from 5 January 2021. • The government to introduce requirements to carry out an environmental and resource survey prior to demolition and major renovations. The survey will map the occurrence of contaminants and the possibility of re-use and recycling of the materials. 4 https://stateofgreen.com/en/partners/3xn/solutions/designing-housing-for-disassembly-and-reuse/ Reduce the generation of waste, in particular waste that is not suitable for preparing for re-use or recycling. • Danish companies will need to pay for the waste disposal of packaging used for their branded products by 2025. Identify products that are the main sources of littering, notably in natural and marine environments, and take appropriate measures to prevent and reduce litter from such products, where Member States decide to implement this obligation through market restrictions, they shall ensure that such restrictions are proportionate and non-discriminatory. • The environmental organization Plastic Change works for combatting plastic pollution on a global scale. Accredited by UNEA, it works with major brands to reduce plastic packaging, single us sups, plastic bags and the use of microbeads. Based on voluntary work and grants, the organization has distributed knowledge on littering to more than 50 million people worldwide. • The EU Single Use Plastics Directive will be implemented. • EPR system to be introduced to Danish companies for packaging used for their branded products by 2025. Aim to halt the generation of marine litter as a contribution towards the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal to prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds. • Introduce a ban on certain single-use plastics • Reduce the amount of specific forms of plastic take-away packaging by 50 % • Require recycling of a minimum of 60 % of collected plastic waste • Establish a research mission on recycling and reduction of e.g. plastic waste Develop and support information campaigns to raise awareness about waste prevention and littering. • Regional and local waste organisations have put up information centers linked to their recycling/waste centers. • A number of special purpose NGOs conduct information and awareness raising campaigns especially for preventing food waste and plastic packaging • Mind the trash -teaching material for school students in 4.-6. class on waste and resources. Website with eight teaching courses. Additional implemented prevention measures, not covered by Article 9 Collection of used textiles Denmark has a long tradition for used textile collection by charities and private actors. Recently municipal waste companies have begun collecting used textiles and textiles waste in civic amenity centres and via door-to-door collection. Some brands/retailers have also experimented with collection. Collection of used textiles from public institutions (hospitals etc. is minimal, as is collection of workwear from business. In Denmark, collection of used textiles is not considered to be waste collection when the collector makes it clear that it only wishes to receive clean, reusable textiles. However, typically 20-30 % of collected textiles are not reusable but are directed to recycling. The Danish government and supporting parties agreed in June 2020 to require Danish municipalities to carry out the separate collection of textile waste from 20225. 5 https://www2.mst.dk/Udgiv/publications/2020/06/978-87-7038-202-1.pdf FOOD WASTE PREVENTION Food waste generation Denmark produces approximately 1,200,000 tonnes food waste from primary production, processing and manufacturing, retail, restaurants and households annually. The amount of food waste from households has decreased by 14,000 tonnes from 2011 to 2017. That is an average decrease in food waste of 8 % per household per week. Measures to prevent food waste ONE\\THIRD, a think tank operating as an independent organization under the Danish Ministry of Environment and Food Their five focus areas are: 1. Support the civil society's battle against food loss and food waste 2. Contribute to general business opportunities relating to food waste prevention 3. Offer insights on how to overcome barriers to preventing food waste and food losses 4. Improve data collection and impact assessment 5. International cooperation on know-how and sharing of experiences Their actions have been described in the previous table (Specific waste prevention measures structured according to Art 9 WFD) The REFOOD label is a scheme for companies and organizations in the food and service sector, for minimising and recycling food waste. Membership requires to choose three food waste reduction initiatives and have a scheme for recycling food waste. in 2021, 1320 organisations hold the refood certificate. Several food donor and food sharing programmes and organisations have emerged during the last years. The NGO Stop Spild Af Mad (“Stop Wasting Food”), the largest movement against food waste pushed for the first “National Day of Food Waste” celebrated on September 29, to raise awareness on the issue. The NGO has launched a food bank called GratisMad (“Free Food”), Food Sharing Copenhagen is also one of Demark’s largest volunteer-led organisations working to raise awareness of and prevent food waste. Food Sharing Copenhagen has built relationships with local fruit and vegetable suppliers and wholesalers and large food sharing events take place once to twice a week Eat GRIM (“Eat Ugly”) delivers food boxes of organic and “ugly” fruit and vegetables, which won’t fit supermarket’s beauty standards, nor the EU’s quality standards. By buying whatever farmers could not sell they have saved around 572 tons of food and created over $1 billion income for farmers. REUSE OF PRODUCTS Data With regard to the Commission Implementing Decision (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2021.010.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ%3AL%3A2021%3A01 0%3ATOC), this section will be updated by the EEA accordingly. Measures to support ReUse In the frame of the EU TAIEX-EIR PEER 2 PEER programme, which provides tailored support to Member States' authorities implementing environmental policy and legislation Danish waste organisation has conducted study visits to learn from Belgium on how to create repair and reuse networks6. 6 https://www.municipalwasteeurope.eu/newsitem/denmark-belgium-taiex-eir-p2p-study-visit-experts-danish-municipal-waste-management-learn Aarhus area waste organisation supports reuse in their recycling center, where people can leave things they don’t use anymore and pick up needed used items. Volunteers additionally host exhibitions, events and courses on waste and recycling. Depending on the season, citizens can come by and e.g. fix their bikes etc. The center has 300-350 visitors a day and a yearly turnover of ca 500 tons of objects, furniture, saving ca 550 tons CO2. Each year, about 50 school classes visit REUSE to take part in an interactive education. Moreover, students moving to Aarhus in August can get a free “move-in box” including table ware, pots and pans. Cargo bike are available for free when need to transport bigger objects The smartphone app ‘kleen hub’ allows restaurants to lend their customers reusable stainless steel boxes and coffee mugs instead of using compostable or plastic food containers. Customers can borrow the boxes for up to 10 days and without any cost unless the box is not returned. In collaboration between City of Copenhagen, some NGOs and the industry a guide for reuse and recycling of plastic consumer packaging has been published. It contains considerations when choosing reuse as a business model and design parameters for reuse and reuse case studies7. A collaboration between a major Danish Brewery and four of Denmark’s largest music festivals replaces 2 million disposable plastic cups with reusable cups that can be washed and reused. Previously the four festivals formerly served drinks in more than 2 million disposable plastic cups during the music festivals. Now, the beverages will be served in reusable cups that are collected after use. Then they are washed in a huge, mobile dishwasher that can wash 9,000 cups an hour, which allows the cups to be reused during the festivals. The Knowledge Centre for Circular Economy in Construction guides building owners, contractors, advisers and municipalities on recycling of C&D waste and on problematic substances in rebuilding, renovation and demolition. The advisory board on circular economy has drawn up a number of innovative recommendations for the building sector which are now being implemented. The following actions relate to reuse: • additional information requirements for amounts of reused, recycled and recyclable materials and for undesirable substances in new buildings and large renovation projects from 2020, with a voluntary sustainability classification system for buildings becoming mandatory in 2025 • a standardised, freely available digital building passport, plus a product database for suppliers with digital factsheets for building products • a selective demolition plan to identify materials and the content of hazardous substances, assess materials’ recycling/reuse value and specify demolition methods8. Best practice examples Support for reuse at municipal recycling stations Municipal recycling stations receive large amounts of waste, which can be prepared for reuse and recycling, including furniture and other furniture, textiles, building materials and electronics. However, only part of these fractions are actually reused/recycled, as their appeal is in practice not high enough for the potential next user. Thus, it is not always economically attractive for the municipal waste companies to prepare such products for reuse/recycling. To recovery as much as possible with a practical value, some recycling stations train employees to be able to assess the value of the products used so that these employees can sort the saleable items for their own second-hand shops. Several recycling stations carry out sorting and cleaning of many products before these go on to reuse. A number of recycling stations also repair incoming products (e.g. furniture and white goods) which are sold in their thrift stores. Some recycling stations also has barter markets where 7 Network for circular plastic packaging. 2019 Design Guide.

Moreover, several municipal recycling stations collect for other actors, including charities which then organise further recycling and reuse (e.g. textiles). Food Sharing Copenhagen Food Sharing Copenhagen is a voluntary based organisation for utilising non-sold food in Copenhagen. In 2019 their collective efforts helped save over 13,000 tons of food waste and nourish over 16,000 people. Every week, they collect surplus food from businesses, including bread and dry goods that would have been thrown out to waste and share it with hundreds of people. The food sharing events take place once to twice a week thanks to a significant number of volunteers. In contrast to most other similar social activities Food sharing Copenhagen was able to keep up its activities also during the pandemic. Under their principles of unconditional sharing, Food Sharing Copenhagen doesn’t make a distinction between those who are accessing the services based on financial disadvantage or those who are simply making an ethical choice. Links to circular economy Waste prevention is an integral part of the comprehensive transformation towards a circular economy. It reduces the input of natural resources into the economy as well as the necessary efforts to collect and recycle waste. Approaches for improving circularity are often highly interlinked with successful waste prevention. The following table shows which circular strategies are explicitly integrated into the German waste prevention programme. Topic Addressed in the programme Comments Eco-design Yes Inter alia by supporting EU eco-design regulation Repair, refurbishment and remanufacture Yes E.g. guided t is organised linked to some municipal waste centers’ activities . Recycling Yes Recycling of municipal waste is covered in the Danish waste management law. Increased recycling of biomass and construction waste are foci in Denmark’s circular economy action plan. Economic incentives and finance Yes Inter alia by assessing how waste prevention can be included in eco-modulated packaging fees. Circular business models Yes E.g. multi-stakeholder platforms for business models aiming to prevent food waste throughout the food chain Eco-innovation Yes E.g. project on construction for disassembly. Governance, skills and knowledge Yes E.g. by integrating waste prevention into comprehensive school curriculum. Training in green procurement for public procurers."

This transformation has occurred as a result of a dedicated and thorough policy regime that draws in key actors and assigns clear responsibilities. In the 1970s, landfilling and dumping of waste on sites lacking any kind of environmental protection was still the most common waste disposal practice in Denmark. Landfill was still so common in the 1980s that the landfill capacity was exhausted in the Copenhagen region. The generation and disposal of waste in Denmark was first mapped in 1985. This showed that 39 % of all waste and 33 % of household waste ended in landfills. The percentage of household waste landfilled was reduced to 19 % by 1995 and to 4 % by 2008, while recycling and incineration have simultaneously increased; waste is now seen as a resource to be recovered. As a consequence, many landfills receive so little waste that it is no longer economically viable to keep them fully operational (ETC/SCP, 2012, Fischer et al., 2013). The first National Waste Plan was developed in 1992, covering the period 1993–97. It included targets for recycling, incineration and landfilling of all waste (Fischer et al., 2013). Since then three plans covering the periods 1998–2004, 2005–2008 and 2009–2012 have been developed and implemented. The current plan, Denmark without Waste, Resource Plan for Waste Management 2013-2018 was adopted in 2014. The waste regulation per 1 January 2010 (Statutory order on waste 2010) changed the definition of waste regarded as MSW. All enterprises became responsible for the recycling of suitable waste under the new regulation, whereas previously, the municipalities had more authority over and duties for recyclable waste from private enterprises. In addition to household waste, fractions similar to household waste from institutions, commerce and offices had also been collected by through municipal schemes (Marcher, 2005). The change in regulation also resulted in municipalities no longer having responsibility for ensuring that sufficient recycling capacity was available either at publicly or privately owned plants for waste from institutions, commerce and offices. In order to keep 5 the coherence of the data time series, this sorted recyclable waste has been removed from municipal waste data since 1995. A new waste data system, based on the European List of Waste, was introduced in 2011 (Eurostat, 2015). Municipalities have the responsibility for introducing collection schemes to secure meeting the targets on the national level, through whichever collection scheme they choose. Practically all households in Denmark have a door-to-door collection service for residual waste. In general, 70 % of municipalities provide a source-separated collection service for paper and glass (Gibbs et al., 2014a). In addition, separate collection of further waste fractions is offered by some municipalities. In 2014, Denmark generated 4.3 million tonnes of MSW, and all generated waste was reportedly sent to treatment operations (Eurostat, 2016). 2.1 Municipal solid waste indicators The following indicators illustrate the development of Danish MSW generation and management in 2001–2014. All percentage figures have been calculated as proportions of generated waste, rather than managed waste. Figure 2.0 Denmark, municipal solid waste generation per person, 2001 – 2014 Source: Eurostat, 2016. According to Eurostat data, the generation of MSW in Denmark (Figure 2.) increased between 2001– 2008, from 606 kilograms per person to 741 kilograms, and then decreased to 673 kilogram in 2010. The considerable increase to 781 kilograms per person in MSW generation that can be seen between 2010 and 2011 may be due to the introduction of a new waste data system in 2011. In 2012-2014 MSW generation stabilized at 750–760 kilogram per person. Management of MSW in Denmark is characterised by a high degree of incineration, amounting to 54 % in 2014. It is the highest percentage and the highest amount per person in EU-28 (Eurostat, 2016). 6 2.1.1 Municipal solid waste recycling, 2001–2014 Figure 2. shows the development of recycling of MSW in Denmark related to total recycling, material recycling and composting and other biological treatment. Figure 2. illustrates a positive trend between 2001 and 2009. Total recycling increased from 31 % in 2001 to 44 % in 2009. Thereafter, the total recycling rate levelled at close to 44 %. Figure 2.1 Denmark, recycling of municipal solid waste, 2001–2014, per cent and tonnes Source: Eurostat, 2016. The increase in recycling rate is primarily linked to material recycling. The major increase in material recycling waste took place between 2007 and 2008. Most of this increase can be explained by increased generation and recycling of iron and other metals from households. There was, however, a problem with the reporting of metals from households, leading to unrealistically high amounts being recorded (ISAG Database 2012 and Miljøstyrelsen, 2011). According to the new waste data system (Table 2.1), the data for 2011–2013 show that the main waste fractions collected from households include paper, wood, packaging glass and iron and steel. Organic recycling only increased from 14 % to 17 % between 2001 and 2014, an increase from 449 000 tonnes to 743 000 tonnes. The main part of this is garden waste from households (Table 2.1). 7 Table 2.1 Denmark, main waste fractions of household waste collected, 2104, ‘000 tonnes 2011 2012 2013 Domestic and similar wastes 1 440 1 382 1 354 Waste suitable for incineration 491 469 456 Organic waste 56 54 65 Paper incl. newspapers and packaging paper 189 190 178 Packaging cardboard and other cardboard 34 38 45 Packaging glass 98 95 94 Glass 13 12 17 Packaging wood 0.4 0.4 7 Wood 76 98 117 Packaging plastic 17 15 17 Plastic 6 9 10 Packaging metal 6 6 8 Iron and steel 111 98 93 WEEE 39 40 49 Refrigerators containing freon 3 5 14 Batteries 2 1 1 Garden waste 534 551 569 Tires 4 4 4 Impregnated wood 15 13 16 PVC 1 1 1 Plaster 2 2 2 Waste suitable for landfill 72 69 50 Other wastes 63 66 106 Total 3 272.4 3218.4 3 273 Source: Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2015. The EU’s 2008 WFD includes a target for certain fractions of MSW: ‘by 2020, the preparing for re-use and the recycling of waste materials such as at least paper, metal, plastic and glass from households and possibly from other origins as far as these waste streams are similar to waste from households shall be increased to a minimum of overall 50 % by weight’. EU Member States may choose between four different methodologies to calculate compliance with the target1. Denmark has chosen calculation method 1 (Hogg et al., 2015). The recycling rates shown in this paper correspond to method 4, the only method for which time series data exist. In 2015, the European Commission has proposed new targets for municipal waste of 60 % recycling and preparing for reuse by 2025 and 65 % by 2030, based on only one calculation method, and with the option of time derogations for some countries (EC, 2015b). 1 Commission Decision 2011/753/EU allows countries to choose between four different calculation methods to report compliance with this target. Member States have the option of considering four alternative waste streams and fractions: 1. paper, metal, plastic and glass household waste; 2. paper, metal, plastic, glass household waste and other single types of household waste or of similar waste from other origins; 3. household waste; 4. municipal waste (the method used in this document). 8 2.1.2 Landfilling of biodegradable municipal waste According to the EU Landfill Directive (1999/31/EC), Member States have to reduce the amount of biodegradable municipal waste (BMW) landfilled by a specific percentage by 2006, 2009 and 2016. The targets are related to the amount of BMW generated in 1995, 1 813 000 tonnes in Denmark’s case. In 1997, Denmark implemented a landfill ban on biodegradable MSW. According to data reported to the European Commission, Denmark has not landfilled BMW for many years (EC, 2015a). Figure 2.2 Denmark, landfill of biodegradable municipal waste, 2006–2012 Source: EC, 2015a. 2.1.3 Regional differences of municipal solid waste recycling, 2001–2013 No regional data for Denmark has been reported to Eurostat. 2.1.4 Recycling and landfill taxes The Danish Landfill Tax was introduced on 1 January 1987, along with a tax on incineration. The aim was to create an incentive to reduce the amount of waste going to landfill and incineration and to promote recycling (ETC/SCP, 2012). Originally, the landfill tax included only landfills receiving waste from municipal collection schemes, but in 1989 coverage was extended to all landfills, with the exception those for hazardous waste. In 1987, the tax was DKK 40 per ton of waste (~EUR 5.3). The landfill tax was increased several times – to DKK 160 in 1993 (~EUR 21.3), DKK 335 in 1997 (~EUR 44.7), DKK 375 (~EUR 50) in 1999 and DKK 475 (~EUR 63.3) in 2010. The tax is levied on waste delivered to registered plants and a refund is granted for waste that is subsequently removed, for example, for recycling. In that way, the tax is only paid for the net amount received (ETC/SCP, 2012). The incineration tax is lower than the landfill tax. Before 2010, the incineration tax was levied per ton of waste incinerated, since 2010 it depends on the waste’s energy content (59.8 DKK/GJ), and includes also a CO2 tax (Miljøstyrelsen, 2014). 9 From 1985 to 2008, the absolute amount of household waste sent to landfill declined by 0.5 million tonnes, equivalent to a reduction of 77 %. The landfill tax has probably played a role in this reduction, together with other measures such as a ban on the landfilling of combustible waste. Figure 2.3 Denmark, landfill tax and the development of recycling, landfill and incineration of municipal solid waste, 2001–2014 Source: ETC/SCP, 2012, Eurostat, 2016, Miljøstyrelsen, 2014 The landfill tax seems to have had little impact on landfilling of MSW in the last 10 years as it was already at a low level in 2001 (Figure 2.3). Nevertheless, the landfilling rate has decreased from 7.7 % in 2001 to 1.3 % in 2014. The percentage of incineration of MSW has decreased from 61 % in 2001 to 54 % in 2014. It is likely that the incineration tax has contributed to this trend, next to the increasing policy focus on recycling. 2.1.5 Environmental benefits of better municipal solid waste management Figure 2.4 shows a scenario for greenhouse gas emissions from MSW management in Denmark. The scenario assumes a yearly growth of 0.9 % for municipal waste generation for 2011–2015 and 0.6 % for 2015–2022. The scenario also assumes that EU targets for municipal waste are fully met. The calculation of emissions is based on data and assumptions in the European Reference Model on Municipal Waste Generation and Management. The approach taken in the model is rooted in life-cycle thinking, in that it considers not only direct emissions, but also avoided emissions associated with the recycling of materials, and the generation of energy from waste management processes. The more detailed methodology is described in Gibbs et al. (2014b). The level of emissions depends on the amount of waste generated and the treatment it undergoes each year. Figure 2. shows direct emissions, avoided emissions and net emissions resulting from the management of MSW. All the emissions (positive values) represent direct operating emissions for each waste management option. The phases of the waste management chain covered include waste prevention; material recycling; composting and anaerobic digestion; mechanical biological treatment (MBT) and related technologies; collection and sorting; incineration and landfill. 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 DKK per tonne Landfill of MSW (%) Total incineration, including energy recovery (%) Total recycling (%) Material recycling (%) Composting and digestion (%) Landfill tax per tonne (DKK) 10 For avoided emissions (negative values), the calculations integrate the benefits associated with energy recovery and material recycling of paper, glass, metals, plastics, textiles and wood, and bio-treatment of food and garden waste from MSW (Gibbs et al., 2014c). Figure 2.4 Denmark, scenario for greenhouse gas emissions from municipal solid waste management in Denmark, 2011–2020 Source: ETC/WMGE, calculation based on the European Reference Model on Waste Note: Results presented in this figure should not be used for the compilation of greenhouse gas reporting for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) national inventory report, or be compared with IPCC figures, as the methodology employed here relies on life-cycle thinking and, by definition, differs substantially from the IPCC methodology. MBT means mechanical-biological treatment. In countries with a low landfill share and high recycling rate, waste treatment can have an overall positive impact on greenhouse gas emissions, reducing emissions from the economy as a whole; Denmark is one of these. Based on the modelled scenario with full policy implementation, net emissions from the treatment of municipal waste in Denmark are expected to be negative and further decrease over the period 2011–2020. Throughout the modelled period, direct greenhouse gas emissions related to municipal waste management are almost exclusively from incineration. 2.2 Uncertainties in the reporting Some uncertainties or differences in how countries report MSW recycling can result in different recycling levels. This applies, for example, to the following issues:  the extent of packaging waste from households and similar packaging from other sources included or not included in the MSW recycling reported;  the definition of municipal waste used by the country, such as the inclusion or exclusion of home composting; 11  the methodology used to report the inputs and outputs of MBT and sorting plants. Denmark does not have a producer responsibility scheme for packaging, and figures for the recycling of packaging waste are included in the municipal waste data. Until 2009, a more detailed reporting system had been used, as the general waste statistic did not deliver sufficiently good data on packaging recycling. One of the aims of the new data system for waste, introduced in 2010, was to improve the data quality for the recycling of packaging. Mechanical biological treatment plants are not used in Denmark. 2.3 Important initiatives taken to improve municipal solid waste management The major initiatives to improve MSW management in Denmark were taken before 2001. The landfill tax and incineration tax, introduced in 1987, and the total ban on the landfilling of combustible waste, agreed in 1994 and effective from 1 January 1997, have been the main drivers of the treatment of municipal waste (Fischer et al., 2013). In addition, the establishment of separate collection schemes for paper, glass packaging and garden waste has contributed significantly to the increased level of recycling. Minor initiatives were taken to improve MSW management between 2001 and 2010. The second Danish Waste Plan 1998–2004 (Waste 21) set a target of 60 % recycling for paper and cardboard waste from households and municipalities with low rates of separate collection of paper were obliged to introduce separate containers in each household for paper waste (Regeringen, 1999). The potential in tonnes was huge. The data, however, shows little change in the volume of paper collected from households between 2000 and 2009 (Miljøstyrelsen, 2011). During the last decade the recycling centres for household waste run by the municipalities have been expanded and more waste types can be delivered to the recycling centres. The third Danish Waste Plan 2005–2008 implemented the targets in the EU Directive for packaging and packaging waste that had to be fulfilled in 2008. Some initiatives focused on municipal waste. The municipalities had to implement collection schemes for metal packaging and certain types of plastic packaging (Regeringen, 2003). The introduction of a deposit system for single-use beverage packaging in 2002 increased the amount of separately collected plastic and metal packaging waste and the amount of recycling. However, the potential in tonnes for these schemes were quite small and it did not influence the total recycling of municipal waste. The fourth Danish Waste Plan 2009–2012 did not focus on new initiatives for the recycling of municipal waste other than setting a target for the collection of batteries (Regeringen, 2009). The most recent initiatives were introduced in the National Waste Management Plan (NWMP) for 201–2018, released in 2014 (Miljøstyrelsen, 2014). The initiatives presented in it are focused on meeting the recycling targets for household waste. The Danish national target is that 50 % of organic, including wood, paper, cardboard, glass, plastic, and metal waste from households is collected for recycling or material recovery by 2022, and the strategy for achieving this is based on ensuring the development of new separate collection schemes in municipalities. This will allow citizens better access to sorting and secure an increase in the recycling of waste, including organic, plastic and metal fractions. In addition, establishing partnerships between different actors, including municipalities, companies, designers and anthropologists, could help the development of simple and easily accessible waste systems (BiPRO and CRI, 2015). In 2013, Denmark also adopted the Denmark without Waste (Danmark uden affald) strategy and a number of follow-up projects have been started or finalised (Miljøstyrelsen, 2016). 12 Figure 2.5 Denmark, recycling of municipal solid waste in Denmark and important policy initiatives, 2001–2014 Source: Eurostat, 2016.– 2.4 Possible future trends According to the data presented in Figure 2., the recycling rate has increased very slowly since 2009. The 2013 Denmark without Waste strategy (Regeringen, 2013) and the NWMP 2013–2018 (Miljøstyrelsen, 2014) aim to increase the share of recycling, particularly through increased separate collection. These initiatives have only just started and it remains to be seen how effective they will be. 13 References BiPRO and CRI, 2015, National factsheet on separate collection – Denmark, prepared within the EC study Assessment of separate collection schemes in the 28 capitals of the EU.
