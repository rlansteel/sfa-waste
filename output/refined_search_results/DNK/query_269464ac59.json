It builds to a large extent on the answers provided by the \nDanish Environmental Protection Agency in April 2021 to a questionnai re developed by the EEA and \nETC/WMGE . The EEA and ETC/ CE would like to thank the Danish authorities for the provided \ninformation and for the kind review of draft s of this assessment report in 2021 and April 2022 .1 Introduction \n1.1 Background and purpose\nThe Waste Framework Directive 2008/98/EC (as amended by Directive (EU) 2018/851) includes a \ntarget to recycle and prepare for reuse, by 2025, 55 % of municipal waste generated. The Packaging \nand Packaging Waste Directive (94/62/EC as amended by Directive (EU) 2018/852) includes targets \nfor the recycling of packaging waste, both in total and by material, to be achieved by 2025. The Landfill \nDirective (1999/31/EC as amended by Directive (EU) 2018/850) requires to limit the landfilling of \nmunicipal waste to 10 % o f the generated municipal waste by 2035. The Directives also foresee that \nthe European Commission, in cooperation with the European Environment Agency, publishes early \nwarning reports on the Member States’ progress towards the attainment of the targets, in cluding a \nlist of Member States at risk of not attaining the targets within the respective deadlines, three years \nahead of the target dates. This assessment is a contribution from the EEA to the early warning reports \naccording to Article 11b Waste Framewor k Directive and Art. 6b Packaging and Packaging Waste \ndirective. \nThis document is an early warning assessment for Denmark . The document is based on the analysis of \na number of factors affecting recycling performance (success and risk factors). The assessm ent aims \nat concluding whether Denmark is at risk of missing the targets for municipal waste and packaging \nwaste set in EU legislation for 2025. In addition, it provides a preliminary assessment of the prospects \nfor meeting the 2035 target for landfilling of municipal waste. \nThe assessment takes into account information that was available before 10 May 2022. \n1.2 Approach\nThe assessment follows a methodology developed by the EEA and ETC/WMGE and consulted with the \nEionet in 2020 (ETC/WMGE, 2021) , which was adjusted in 2021 taking into account experiences with \napplying the methodology in 2021 (ETC/CE & ETC/WMGE, 2022) . This methodo logy uses a set of \nquantitative and qualitative success and risk factors that have been identified to affect the recycling \nperformance . The assessment is to a large extent based on the information provided by the Member \nState in the reply to an EEA -ETC/WMG E questionnaire as well as on available data and information \nfrom Eurostat and other relevant sources. In addition, a consortium under contract with the European \nCommission (led by Ramb øll Group) has conducted a critical review of the draft assessment in \nQ4/2021 and provided further information. \nMore specifically, chapter 2.1 assesses the likelihood for Denmark to achieve the target to prepare for \nreuse and recycle at least 55 % of municipal solid waste (MSW) for 2025. Chapter 2.2 assesses the \nlikelihood for Denmark to achieve the overall packaging waste and specific packaging materials’ \nrecycling targets for 2025. Chapter 2.3 examines the prospects for Denmark to landfill less than 10 % \nof the generated municipal solid waste by 2035. The official early wa rning assessment for the \nlandfilling target is only due in 2032 and accordingly, the assessment contained in Chapter 2.3 is only \npreliminary. 1.3 Member State profile – context parameters \nMunicipal waste generation and treatment \nThe annual municipal waste generation and treatment has remain ed rather stable in Denmark \nbetween 2016 and 2020 . The municipal waste generation was around 5 million tonnes in 2020 . Waste \ngeneration per capita is very high, with 845 kg/cap in 2020, which is significan tly higher than the \n(estimated) EU average of 50 5 kg/cap in 20 20 . The country has a quite even division between waste \ncollected for recycling and waste incineration , being 53.9 % and 45.2 % respectively in 2020 . L ess than \n1 % is being landfilled. Waste col lected for m aterial recycling increased between 2016 and 2020 from \n29.9 % to 35.5 %, while composting and digestion stagnated around 18. 4 % . The recycling rate \n(collected for material recycling and composting and digestion ) has increased from 4 8.3 % in 201 6 to \n53.9 % in 20 20 (Eurostat, 2022a) .\nDenmark has a very high incineration capacity, roughly double the amount of residual municipal waste \nsent to incineration in 2019. On 16 June 2020, the Danish Government and Parties representing a \nbroad majority in the Danish Parliament agreed on a Climate plan for a green waste sector and a \ncircular economy . The climate plan i ncludes initiatives – amongst others – towards reducing waste and \nreducing the capacity for waste incineration. In order to adjust the capacity , a tender -based model is \nforeseen and the waste incineration plants will have to compete for the waste. Environmental \nrequirements for the incineration plants will be tightened so that plants that lag behind \nenvironmentally either invest in technological improvements or close. \nFigure 1.1 Municipal waste generation and treatment in Denmark between 2016 and 2020, in \nthousand tonnes \nNotes: Provisional data for 2020 \nSource : Eurostat (2022a) Legal Framework \nThe main national regulations in the area of waste are the Environmental Protection Act (Miljø - og \nFødevareministeriet, 2022) and the Statutory Order on Waste (Miljøministeriet, 2020b) , defining \nprinciples, responsibilities and requirements on waste prevention and management in Denmark . The \nStatutory Order on waste regulations, fees and actors (Klima -, Energi - og Forsyningsministeriet, 2020) \ncovers the treatment of waste that is not regulated by other legislation, the municipalities ’ regulations \non waste, schemes for waste, fees for waste, assignment of waste benchmarking of w aste incineration \nplants . In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency has issued guidelines for the sorting and \ncollection of municipal waste from households (Miljøministeriet, 2020c, 2020d) .\nWaste management plan(s) \nDenmark’s National Waste Management Plan (NWMP) Action plan for circular economy - National \nplan for prevention and management of waste 2020 -2032 (Handlingsplan for cirkulær økonomi -\nNational plan for forebyggelse og håndtering af affal d 2020 -2032) was adopted by the Danish Ministry \nof Environment (Miljøministeriet) in 202 1 (Miljøministeriet, 2021a) .\nThe plan was drawn up largely based on previous strategies, agreements, plans and revised ordinances \nand can thus be seen as a consolidation of these. It will be reviewed at the latest after six years from \nits adoption. The NWMP covers all types of waste g enerated in Denmark also including commercial \nwaste, sewage sludge, soil waste. The o nly exception is nuclear/radioactive waste. The NWMP covers \nthe entire territory and is supplemented by municipal WMPs. \nAccording to the NWMP sorting and collection of hou sehold waste must be streamlined for ten types \nof household waste (food, paper, cardboard, metal, glass, plastic, textile and hazardous waste as well \nas food and beverage cartons and residual waste). These waste streams must be collected from \nhouseholds a nd common national sorting criteria for household waste must be used to create a basis \nfor increased recycling with higher quality. \nThe N WMP states that the Danish government expects to mee t the 2025 and 2030 packaging waste \nrecycling targets by implementi ng all measures included in the plan , with the exception of plastic . To \nincrease plastic s recycling, Denmark is launching a number of initiatives such as the ban of the \nmarketing of certain disposable plastic products; a requirement to use 25 % recycled plastic in plastic \nbottles in 2025 and 30 % in 2030; a requirement of a minimum of 60 % real recycling of collected \nplastic waste from households by 2022 (Miljøministeriet, 2020b) .\nPackaging waste generation and tr eatment \nIn Denmark , 983 000 tonnes ( 169 kg/cap) of packaging waste were generated in 2019 , which is slightly \nbelow the EU average of 178 kg/cap. Packaging waste generation has been increasing , espe cially \nplastics packaging (Figure 1.2). Paper and cardboard packaging waste generation fluctuates at the \nlevel of approximately 67 kg/cap since 2010 (Eurostat, 2022b) .Figure 1.2 Packaging waste generation in Denmark between 20 10 and 201 9, in kg per capita \nNote : Data for 2010 are estimated values for all packaging waste, and in 2011 there is a break in \ntime series for metallic and glass packaging . Values for 2011 and 2012 are flagged as estimate s\nfor metallic and glass packaging. \nSource : Eurostat (2022b) \nCapture rate s for recyclables \nThe capture rate is a good performance indicator of the effectiveness of the separate collection \nsystem . The capture rate has been calculated for this report by dividing the separately collected \nweight of a certain municipal waste material by the estimated weight of the total amount of material \nin the municipal waste. The Danish EPA has provided calculations for the residual waste composition \nfor m unicipal waste . Due to an expected difference in composition for recycling stations and \nhouseholds/non -households residual waste, amounts of materials present in the residual waste from \nthese two sources were calculated separately. For Denmark the separat e collection capture rates are \npresented in Table 1.1 .Table 1.1 Capture rates for different waste fractions in Denmark                                                                                            \n\nResidual\nwaste\ncompo -\nsition\n(%) (a)\nResidual\nwaste\ncomposition\n(tonnes) (b)\nResidual\nwaste\ncomposition\nfor recycling\nstations\n(%) (c)\nResidual\nwaste\ncomposition\nfor recycling\nstations\n(tonnes) (d)\nSeparately\ncollected\namounts\n(tonnes)\n(e)\nMaterials in\ntotal MSW\n(tonnes)\nCapture\nrate s(%)\nMixed\nmunicipal\nwaste, total\n1858 138 136 709\nPaper and\ncardboard 18 343 220 18 25 252 555 614 924 086 60\nMetals 236 341 22674 166 562 205 577 81\nGlass 228 265 22080 148 420 178 765 83\nPlastic 10 193 298 10 14 222 75 331 282 851 27\nGarden waste 113 612 11367 948 750 963 730 98\nFood waste 44 820 921 11367 115 188 937 476 12\nTextiles 240 379 56835 1203 48 418 2\nWood n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a\n\nSource: Miljø ministeriet (2022) \nNote s: (a) Analysis of household residual waste and source -separated organic waste, 2018, the Danish \nEPA (Miljø - og Fødevareminis teriet, 2017) . The composition is calculated based on data from \nthe report. \n(b) The composition of household and non -household municipal residual waste is assumed to \nbe the same. The amount of mixed municipal waste is from Affaldsstatistik 2019 (Miljø - og \nFødevareministeriet, 2020), excl. the amount from recycling stations. \n(c) For residual waste from recycling stations, the same composition from household residual \nwaste was applied except for the share of food and textile waste. The composition is an \nestimate. \n(d) Provided by the Danish EPA \n(e) As reported in Affaldsstatistik 2019 , Miljø - og Fødevareministeriet (2020) \nThis indicates that there is some room for improvem ent to capture higher amounts of the generated \nfood waste, plastics and textiles and to some extent also of paper and cardboard .\nSince 2017 more municipalities ha ve increased the number of separately collected material which is \nexpected to affect the comp osition of municipal residual waste, especially for food waste \n(Miljøministeriet, 2022) . While a capture rate for WEEE can be calculated with the same method, it \ndelivers unreliable outcomes as there are considerable invisible flows (Miljøministeriet, 2021b) that \nare not captured in the data .2 Success and risk factors likely to influence \nfuture performance\n2.1 Target for preparing for reuse and recycling of m unicipal waste\nThis chapter aims at assessing the prospects of Denmark to achieve the 55 % preparing for reuse and \nrecycling target for municipal waste in 2025. For a detailed description of the methodology followed, \nthe development of success/risk factors and their impact on recycling, please consult the methodology \nreport (ETC/CE & ETC/WMGE, 2022) .\n2.1.1 Current situation and past trends \nSRF MSWR -1.1 : Distance to target \nThe overall recycling rate of Denmark shows a steady increase mainly driven by increasing material \nrecycling ( Figure 2.1). In this analysis the recycling rate is calculated by dividing the summed amounts \nof recycling of materials and of composting and digesti on by the total generated amounts. The data \nsource used is the Eurostat data set Municipal waste by waste management operations [env_wasmun] \n(following the OECD/Eurostat Joint Questionnaire); Data reported by Member States according to \nArticle 10.2(a) of t he Waste Framework Directive are not used for this assessment as the reporting \nmethods differ by Member State, resulting in a lack of comparability between Member States. The \ndata source used here is assumed to be the best available proxy , given that data in accordance with \nthe rules on the calculation of the attainment of the targets as defined in Article 11a are not yet \navailable. \nFigure 2.1 Recycling rate in Denmark between 201 6 and 20 20 , in percentage \nSource : Eurostat (2022a) The actual distance to the target for the most recent data point is a key factor determining the \nlikelihood of meeting/not meeting the target. The closer the M ember State is to the target already, \nthe more likely it becomes that the target will be met . For Denmark , the rate of municipal waste \ncollected for recycling is 53.9 % in 20 20 , which is close to the 55 % target for 2025 (Miljø - og \nFødevareministeriet, 2020) .\nHowever, the data used for this analysis is based on a different methodology than the calculation rules \nfor the target. The Danish government has provisionally estimat ed the impact of the application of \nthe new calculation rules on the recycling rates by accounting for average loss rates p er waste type. \nThe expected impact on the recycling rate for municipal waste is that the recycling rate would drop \nfrom 52 % to 44 % for 2019 (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 202 0). The same 8 percentage \npoint decrease is applied t o the latest available data (2020) in this assessment to calculate the actual \ndistance to the target. The Danish government is working on a more precise way of calculating the \nrecycling rate according to the new rules (Miljøministeriet, 2022) .\nSummary result                                     \n\nDistance to target 5-15\npercentage points\nBased on the currently available data, Denmark’s recycling rate was\n53.9 % in 2020, 1.1 percentage points below the 2025 target .Considering\nhowever, the application of the new calculation rules , an estimated\ndecrease of the recycling rate by 8percentage points is assumed , leading\nto an approx imate recycling rate of 4 5.9 %or 9.1 percentage points below\nthe target .\nRobustness of the underlying\ninformation\nThe new calculation rules are likely to lead to lower calculated recycling\nlevels. Based on calculations done by the Danish authorities , the recycling\nrate would drop by 8 percentage points .\n\nSRF MSWR -1.2: Past trend in municipal solid waste recycling rate \nThe recycling rate over the last five years shows a steady increase of 5.6 percentage point s from 2016 \nto 2020 , mainly driven by increasing material recycling (Figure 2.1). This indicates that efforts have to \nbe i ntensified compared to progress of the past few years. \nSummary res ult                           \n\nRR > 45%, and increase in\nlast 5 years < 10 percentage\npoints\nThe recycling rate has increased with 5.6 percentage points. For Denmark\nthe application of the new calculation rules would result in an estimated\nrecycling rate of 45.9 %, based on estimates done by the Danish\nEnvironmental Protection Agency that the recyclin g rate would decrease\nby 8 percentage points .The pace of improvemen t needs to be speeded up\nto obtain the target.\nRobustness of the underlying\ninformation\nThere are no break sin the time series data. For 2019 t he Danish\nEnvironmental Protection Agency estimated that the recycling rate would\ndrop by 8 percentage points i fthe new calculation rules w ould be applied ,\nthis same rate is used for 202 0in this assessment.\n\n2.1.2 Legal instruments \nSRF MSWR -2.1: Timely transposition of the revised Waste Framework Directive into national law \nTimely transposition of the Waste Framework Directive as amended by Directive 201 8/851, into \nnational law within the foreseen period is key for a waste management system in line with E U\nrequirements. Denmark has transposed the amended Waste Framework Directive in its Act No 807 of 9 June 2020 \nand Act No 645 of 19 May 2020 amending the Environmental Protection Act. Furthermore, the \nrequirements for separate collection and waste management are transposed in Order No 2159 of 9 \nDecember 202 0, which has since been repealed and replaced by Order No 2512 of 10 December 2021 .\nSummary result         \n\nTransposition without delay Denmark has transposed the amended WFD into national law by the\ntransposition deadline .\nRobustness of the underlying\ninformation\nCredible information received from the European Commission (status as\nof 12 November 2021 ).\n\nSRF MSWR -2.2 : Responsibilities for meeting the targets, and support and enforcement mechanisms, e.g. \ntools, fines etc. \nClearly defined responsibilities, enforcement and support mechanisms for meeting the targets across \ndifferent entities and governance levels are important for achieving high recycling rates. The clearer \nthe responsibilities for meeting the target s and the accountability for failing the targets are, the higher \nthe chance that the targets will be met. \nThe Ministry of Environment is responsible for preparing the n ational legislation related to waste \nmanagement, including set ting targets for preparation f or re -use, recycling, or material recovery of \nmunicipal waste , as well as stating minimum requirements for the management of waste. \nThe Danish Climate action plan for a green waste sector and a circular economy was adopted in June \n202 0, which agreed to streamline the collection of municipal waste, as well as changing the framework \nfor the waste sector so that it support s less waste incineration and more recycling. Further, it was \nagreed in the same Plan to reduce the incineration capacity . Capacity must be reduced and adapted \nto the Danish waste volumes so that the available capacity is not filled up with imported waste. In \norder to address plastic waste, t he Plan foresees setting up a system for collecting plastic wa ste in the \npublic space by January 2025 at the latest , as part of the extended producer responsibility for \npackaging to be introduced in Denmark .\nThe municipalities are responsible for collecting household waste and packaging waste as a part of \nhousehold waste and have to ensure proper municipal waste management. It is defined in the Danish \nlegislation , which types of waste the municipalities are obliged to collect separately and how the \nmunicipalities are to ensure p roper waste management. The municipalities have to define minimum \nrequirements for the collection of different waste fractions (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, \n2021; Miljø - og Fødevareministeriet, 2019; Miljøministeriet, 2020b) . The municipalities are required \nto separately collect ten different types of waste using high convenience collection systems (door -to -\ndoor or , for apartment blocks, in short walking distance ): food, paper, cardboard, metal, glass, plastic, \ntextile waste as well as beverage and food cartons, residual waste and hazardous waste. Th is \nrequirement is im plemented in national legislation and applies from 1 July 2021 . However, a majority \nof municipalities have been granted a n extension of the deadline until end of 2022 (Miljøministeriet, \n2021a) ; for textile waste the deadline still has to be decided but will lie between 1 July 2023 and 1 \nJanuary 2025. If the municipalities offer bulky waste schemes they are also required to sort the waste \nafter collection in order to achieve a high recycling and reuse rate .\nCommercial p roducer s of waste, including of municipal waste simi lar to household waste , are obliged \nto sort their waste at source into recyclable fractions, and to make sure that the recyclable fractions \nare used for material recovery (Miljøministeriet, 2020b) . Municipalities can decide to organise collection of residual waste from commercial waste producers or oblige them to deliver the waste to \ncertain waste facilities (Energi styrelsen, 2021) . Municipalities are obliged to control the correct \nmanagement of commercial waste via inspections (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021) .\nMeasures to achieve the targets are defined in the Circular Economy Action P lan – National plan for \nprevention and management of waste (Handlingsplan for cirkulær økonomi – National plan for \nforebyggelse og håndtering af affald 2020 -2032) . In addition, the municipalities are required by 1\nJanuary 2022 to set requirements for minimum 60 % recycling of the collected household plastic waste \nin their contracts with the waste coll ectors . The municipalities must furthermore ensure a high \nrecycling rate of all separately collected recyclable types of waste , however, national legislation does \nnot set quantitative targets for recycling for the municipalities to meet .\nThe Danish deposi t and return system (DRS) for beverage packaging is responsible for collection and \nrecycling of disposa ble beverage packaging , not for the handling of refillable bottles . The DRS is \nregulated in the Order  on Deposits  (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; Miljøministeriet, \n202 0a) .\nThe Danish EPA supports the implementation of proper waste management in Denmark via \ncommunication and cooperation with municipalities. The EPA has published guidelines for waste \nmanagement, aiming to streamline and improve waste collection and en sure increasing capture rates \nof recyclables in Denmark for both municipal waste and packaging waste (Danish Environme ntal \nProtection Agency, 2021) .\nRelated to enforcement mechanisms, the National Board of Appeal is the supervising authority for the \nmunicipalities, supervising the compliance with national law. In the case of non -compliance, the Board \ncan assign daily fines to the members of the municipal council as enforcement mechanism.

If an energy content of 10 .6 GJ/ tonne is assumed (Danish Ministry of \nthe Environment, 2013) , the incineration tax alone would be around 557 DKK/t onne , corresponding \nto 75 EUR/t .\nSummary result                  \n\nTaxes > 18 EUR/t (a)\nIf an energy content of 10.6 GJ/tonne is assumed, the incineration tax\nalone would be about 75 EUR/t (corresponding to 53 EUR/t rescaled\nbased on purchasing power parities) .Furthermore, a CO 2-tax is levied on\nincinerated non -biodegradable waste .\nRobustness of the underlying\ninformation\nThe underlying information provided by the Danish authorities can be\nconsidered robust.

However, a PAYT system should be designed with the appropriate level of source separation \nencouragement to ensure that citizens do not misplace waste in recycling bins in order to avoid \nresidual waste charges. Overall, PAYT usually has a positive effect on source separation and thus \nrecycling rates through direct involvement of citiz ens. \nDenmark has a policy of full cost recovery for municipal waste collection which allows for the \npossibility of PAYT -schemes. As a principle , the fees for municipal waste management shall cover all \ncosts related to the service . It is not allowed to cover cost for the service of coll ecting recyclables \nthrough the residual waste fee . The legal framework permits the use of PAYT by municipalities .\nMunicipalities still often charge a flat rate for collection of both recyclables and residual waste , wit hsome municipalities granting citizens a choice of the size of container, the larger container having a\nhigher fee (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; Klima -, Energi - og Forsyningsministeriet, \n2020) . Recent information about the shares of the different systems is not available. A survey of \nDanish municipalities performed in 2015 indicated that container volume based fees and fees based \non a combination of factors were dominant while there was very little use of weight based systems \n(Deloitte and Incentive, 2015) .\nSummary result               \n\nPAYT scheme implemented in\nsome regions/ municipalities\n(50 -80% of population\ncovered)\nDenmark has a policy for municipal waste collection which allows for the\npossibility of PAYT -schemes but m unicipalities often do not implement\nPAYT.\nRobustness of the underlying\ninformation\nIt is unclear how strong the economic incentive is for citizens to plac e\nwaste in the bins for recyclables instead of in the bin for residual waste.\nRecent i nformation about the shares of the different systems (volume\nbased, frequency of collection, weight based) is not available.\n\n2.1.4 Separate collection system \nSRF MSWR -4.1: Convenience and coverage of separate collection systems for the different household \nwaste fractions \nSeparate collection systems are a key enabler for high recycling rates and for collecting recyclables at \nadequate quality. Generally, the more convenient a nd accessible these systems are for their users, \nthe better results they deliver. The assessment methodology categorises different types of collection \nsystems (door -to -door, bring points with a density of > 5 per km 2, bring points with a density of < 5\nper km 2, civic amenity site) for assessing the degree of convenience, and differentiates between cities \n(densely populated), towns and suburbs (intermediate densely populated) and rural (thinly populated \nareas). It then calculates which share of the populatio n is served by which type of system. The \nassessment is done on a material basis and takes into account the different materials according to \ntheir average share in municipal waste. This is described in more detail in the methodology (ETC/CE & \nETC/WMGE, 2022) \nFor Denmark , according to the most recent data, the percentage of households living in cities is 32 %, \nin towns and suburbs 35 % and in rural areas 33 % (Eurostat, 2021a) .\nIn Denmark , there have been a large number of different waste sorting and collection schemes across \nthe municipalities , resultin g in a high variance in the collection schemes between municipalities. This \nchanged in July 2021 with the implementation of the Climate action plan for a green waste sector and \na circular econom y (see next section) , however, the majority of Danish municipalities have been \ngranted an extension of the deadline to fully implement the new requirements until end of 2022 . The \nuse of co -mingled collection has been increasing (Eurostat, 2020b) . The separate collection of food \nwaste is today not covered by all municipalities (56 %) (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, \n2021) .\nThe m unicipalities are required to separately collect ten different types of waste through high \nconvenience collection systems : food, paper, cardboard, metal, glass, plastic, textile waste as well as \nbeverage and food cartons, residual waste and hazardous waste . The collection should be door -to -\ndoor if possible, with respect to the types of buildings/housing area. Depending on the type of areas \na bring point can be used, that is located so it can be reached by foot. Thus, the type of schemes used will change ove r the next two years – since the deadline has been postpone d for a number of \nmunicipalities. \nBoth households and companies are obliged to sort their waste for separate collection. Municipalities \ncan decide if companies can use the collection system organi sed by the municipality or if they should \norganise collection themselves or through contractors. However, m unicipalities are responsible for \nthe inspection of commercial waste management (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; \nMiljøministeriet, 2020c) .\nTable 2.1 gives an overview of the collection system in Denmark . The collection in Demark is material \nbased and the collection systems do not distinguish between packaging and non -packaging waste . The \nDanish EPA publishes data about munic ipaliti es’ implementation of the requirements to collect ten \ndifferent fractions separately  (Miljøministeriet, 2021c) .\nTable 2.1 Characterisation of the collection system in Denmark                                                                                                                     \n\nCities\n(densely populated areas)\nTowns and suburbs\n(intermediate density areas)\nRural areas\n(thinly populated areas)\nDoor -to -door  -\nseparate\nDoor -to -door  -\nco -mingled\nBring point\n(>5 per km²)\nBring point\n(<5 per km²)\nCivic amenity\nsite\nDoor -to -door  -\nseparate\nDoor -to -door  -\nco -mingled\nBring point\n(>5 per km²)\nBring point\n(<5 per km²)\nCivic amenity\nsite\nDoor -to -door  -\nseparate\nDoor -to -door  -\nco -mingled\nBring point\nCivic amenity\nsite\nResidual waste xx xxx xxx x\nPaper and\nCardboard xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nFerrous metals xxxxxxxxxxx\nAluminium xxxxxxxxxxx\nGlass xxxxxxxXxxxxxx\nPlastic xxxxxxxxxxx\nBio -waste\nfood xxxxxx\ngarden xxxxxxxx\nTextiles x\n(few) xxxx\n(few) xxxx\n(few) xx\nWood xxxxxxxxx\nWEEE xxxxxxxx\nComposite\npackaging\nx( a)\n(few)\nx( a)\n(few)\nX( a)\n(few)\nOther:\nHazardous\nwaste\nx\nx\n(with\nWEEE)\nxxxx\nx\n(with\nWEEE)\nxxxx\nx\n(with\nWEEE)\nxx\n\nNote : xx: dominant system; x: other significant systems.

Many municipalities have introduced \ncollection schemes for bat tery waste and small \nelectronic waste, e .g. so that it is collected \ntogether with hazardous waste .\nRobustness of the underlying information \nCredible information received from the Danish \nauthorities through the EEA -ETC/WMGE \nquestionnaire. Danish municipalities apply \ndifferent types of separate collection systems for \nthe different materials. However, no \nquantitative information is available for the \ncoverage of each system. This means that the \npopulation coverages in this table are rough \nestimates. SRF MSWR -4.2: Firm plans to improve the convenience and coverage of separate collection for the \ndifferent household waste fractions \nIn the waste Law it is stated , that as of July 2021, with the option to apply for a derogation until 31 \nDecember 2022 , all municipalities are obliged to arrange high convenience separate collection \nschemes for the following waste fractions (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; \nMiljøministeriet, 2020b) : residual waste , paper , cardboard , metal , glass , plastic , food waste , textiles \n(between mid -2023 and 1 January 2025 ), composite packaging (food - and drink cartons) and \nhazardous waste .\nThe municipalities can choose between door -to -door -separate collection or door -to -door -co -mingled \ncollecti on (for certain combination s of materials ). For glass as well as for all fractions in densely \npopulated areas and from holiday cottages a bring point system in walking distance from the house is \naccepted. For t he following fractions co -mingled collection will be allowed (Danish Environmental \nProtection Agency, 2021; Miljøministeriet, 2020 d) : paper/cardboard , metal/plastic , plastic/ \ncomposite packaging , m etal/plastic/composite packaging and m etal/glass .\nToday, reusable textiles are collected via charity organisations. The separate collection scheme for \ntextile waste will be limited to t extiles waste not suitable for reuse (Danish Environmental Protection \nAgency, 2021) .\nTogether with the national harmonisation of the separate collection system, a harmonised pictogram \nand colo ur scheme is rolled out in order to improve the citizen’s understanding of the waste collection \nsystem across the country . It has been developed by t he Danish Environmental Protection Agency, the \nAssociation of municipalities and the Danish Waste Association and is used or underway to be used \nby nearly all Danish municipalities (Danish Waste Association, 2021) .\nAs of 2023 , non -household waste generators are oblig ed to sort their waste for separate collect ion \nsimilar to household waste for the same fractions as households with the same options regarding co -\nmingled fractions (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; Miljøministeriet, 2020c) . It is \nimportant to note that non -household waste generators already are obliged to sort their waste and \nensure proper waste management . But from 2023 they are obliged to sort municipal waste in the \nsame way and use the same pictograms on the collection containers as municipalities shall for \ncollection containers for household waste.  Non -household waste generators are allowed to sort in \nmore detailed fr actions if it is suitable with regard to the specific waste generated. \nSummary result               \n\nPaper and\ncardboard\nFirm plans to improve the separate\ncollection system, with clear responsible\nentities and defined targets and timeline.\nAs of July 2021 ,but with the option to apply\nfor a derogation until end 2022 , all\nmunicipalities in Denmark are obliged to\narrange separate collection schemes (door -\nto -door or high convenience bring points)\nMetals Firm plans to improve the separate\ncollection system, with c lear responsible\nentities and defined targets and timeline.\nAs of July 2021 ,but with the option to apply\nfor a derogation until end 2022 , all\nmunicipalities in Denmark are obliged to\narrange separate collection schemes (door -\nto -door or high convenience bring points)\n\nPlastics  Firm plans to improve the separate \ncollection system, with clear responsible \nentities and defined targets and ti meline. \nAs of July 2021 , but with the option to apply \nfor a derogation until end 2022 , all \nmunicipalities in Denmark are obliged to \narrange separate collection schemes (door -\nto -door or high convenience bring points) \nGlass  Firm plans to improve the separate \ncollection system, with clear responsible \nentities and defined targets and timeline. \nAs of July 2021 , but with the option to apply \nfor a derogation until end 2022 , all \nmunicipalities in Denmark are obliged to \narrange separate collection schemes (door -\nto -door or high convenience bring points) \nBio -waste  Firm plans to improve the separate \ncollection system, with clear responsible \nentities and defined targets and tim eline. \nAs of July 2021 , but with the option to apply \nfor a derogation until end 2022 , all \nmunicipalities in Denmark are obliged to \narrange separate collection schemes (door -\nto -door or high convenience bring points) \nWood  N/A (for countries already coverin g > 80% of \nthe population by high convenience \ncollection services )\nNo changes planned. \nTextiles  Firm plans to improve the separate \ncollection system, with clear responsible \nentities and defined targets and timeline. \nBetween 2023 and 2025, it will be required \nthat all municipalities in Denmark are obliged \nto arrange separate collection schemes (door -\nto -door or high convenience bring points) \nWEEE  N/A (for countries already covering > 80% of \nthe population by high convenience \ncollection services) \nNo changes planned. \nRobustness of the underlying information \nCredible information received from the \nDanish authorities through the EEA -\nETC/WMGE questionnaire . The obligations for \nmunicipalities are set in the Danish legislation \nand explained in recommendations issued by \nthe Danish EPA. \n2.1.5 Extended producer responsibility (EPR) and similar schemes \nSRF MSWR -5.1: Fee modulation in EPR schemes for packaging \nWithin EPR schemes, fee modulation (or eco -modulation) is a system with different fees for different \ntypes of packaging material and designs. While basic fee modulation, i.e. different fees for the main \nmaterial groups, are common, advanced fee modulation can cre ate stronger incentives for packaging \nproducers to design for recycling and thus create favourable conditions for higher recycling rates. The \nlevel of advancement of the fee modulation is assessed against four criteria that have been selected \nas benchmarks for a well -designed eco -modulated fee system: \n• recyclability, for example differentiating between PET and PS, between different colours of \nPET, or between 100 % cardboard boxes and laminated beverage cartons; \n• sortability and disruptors, for example a malus for labels/caps/sleeves made of other \nmaterials, which are not fitted for the recycling technologies of the main packaging; \n• recycled content; and \n• if there is a transparent compliance check by the Producer Responsibilit y Organisation ( PRO )\nthat producers report correctly. \nDenmark has no general EPR scheme for packaging yet , instead Denmark has a comprehensive deposit \nreturn system for beverage packaging , also aiming at preventing free riding in relation to beverage packaging . The deposit return system is planned to continue and to operate in parallel with a new \ngeneral EPR scheme for all other packaging, which is not covered by the deposit return system. The \nimplementat ion process for setting up a general EPR scheme has started. A law that establish es the \nlegal bas is for a general EPR system for packaging in Denmark was passed by the Danish Government \nin June 2020. In March 2022, t he organisation and administrative setup for the EPR system is still \nunder discussion with political parties (Miljøministeriet, 2022) . The EPR scheme for packaging will be \nintroduced no later than 31 December 2024 and will include all types of packaging in all types of \nmaterials .\nWhile no EPR system and thus no fee modulation within EPR is currently in place for packaging, the \nDanish dep osit return system (Dansk Retursystem) requires producers and importers of bottled and \ncanned beverages to pay a quarterly fee for marketing beverages on which deposits are payable. The \nfees vary for each type of bottle or can , depending on the volume of t he bottle or can and their \nrecyclability . The fees are calculated each year based on the expenditure of Dansk Retursystem versus \nthe income. The fees are required to solely reflect the exact costs of operating and administering an \nefficient deposit and ret urn system (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021) .\nSummary result       \n\nNo EPR scheme and no\nadvanced fee modul ation Denmark has no EPR scheme for packaging yet.\nRobustness of the underlying\ninformation\nCredible information received from the Danish authorities through the\nEEA -ETC/WMGE questionnaire .\n\n2.1.6 Treatment capacity for bio -waste \nSRF MSWR -6.1: Capacity for the treatment of bio -waste \nBio -waste is the largest single waste material fraction in municipal waste, and adequate treatment \ncapacity needs to be made available .\nAs reported by the Danish authorities, the country’s separately collected bio -waste amounted to 1\n336 000 tonnes in 2019 , comprising of 353 000 tonnes of food waste collected from households, \nrestaurants, catering , retail and food industry , and 983 000 ton nes of garden waste . 93 % of garden \nwaste from households was collected for recycling (Miljø - og Fødevareministeriet, 2020) . In 201 9\n882 000 tonnes municipal waste was collecte d for composting and digestion (Eurostat, 2021b) . The \nDanish authorities estimate, based on current knowledge, that 75 % of garden waste collected for \nrecycling undergoes recycling treatment , if accounting for average loss rates per waste type according \nto the new calculation rule s. For food waste the estimate is 85 %. The Danish authorities do not report \na specific availa ble capacity for the treatment of bio -waste. The total generation of bio -waste within \ntotal municipal waste , including separately collected bio -waste and bio -waste present in the residual \nwaste fraction, is estimated at  1 901 206  tonnes in 201 7 (this is the sum of food waste and garden \nwaste ) (Table 1 .1 ).\nAs of July 2021 and by end of 2022 at the latest , all households should have collection of food waste ,\nand from 31 December 2023 the municipalities are required to establish a separate collection scheme \nfor garden waste from households . Bio -waste treatment will be privately organised and m unicipalities \nmust tender the treatment of bio -waste . Municipalities unable to cover the capacity demand from the \nprivate sector may be granted exemption from the legal requirement to tender the treatment of bio -\nwaste and allowed to arrange for treatment capacity themselves (Danish Environmental Protection \nAgency, 2021; Government of Denmark, 2020) .Based on a survey of treatment installations and a calculation on the potential of food waste in \nDenmark, the Waste and Resource Network Denmar k (DAKOFA, 2021) estimates that the current \ncapacity for anaerob ic digestion of food waste covers 72 -87 % of the food waste p otential (related to \nboth food waste from households and the service sector). \nBased on the presented information, it is likely that the currently available capacity for the treatment \nof bio -waste is slightly below 80 % of the generated bio -waste, however, the municipalities have a \nclear mandate to either tender or create the additio nal capacity needed to close any capacity gap. \nSummary result            \n\nBio -waste capacity below 80%\nof generated municipal bio -\nwaste but firm plans to close\nthe gap\nThe Danish authorities report that the required additional capacity\ndemand for the treatment of bio -waste will be covered by the private\nsector or the municipalities .\nRobustness of the underlying\ninformation\nThe information regarding available capacities is limited ,and information\nis lacking on how the future capacity building will be implemented in\npracti ce.\n\nSRF MSWR -6.2: Legally binding national standards and Quality Management System for \ncompost/digestate \nTo create a market for compost and digestate, compost should be of a good quality for use as a soil \nimprover or fertilizer. Legally binding standards provide guarantees regarding the quality of the \ncompost/digestate produced. A quality management system aims at addressing different elements of \na production pr ocess to ensure a stable and high -quality output (product) which helps toward \nreaching a defined quality for the product. \nDenmark has national standards for compost quality (EEA, 2020; Miljø - og Fødevareministeriet, 2018, \n2008) . Before the composting and/or biogas process, the bio -waste needs to comply with the limit \nvalues laid down in statutory order no. 1001 of the 27 June 2018 regarding the use of waste for \nagricultural purposes (Miljøministeriet, 2022) .\nThe Danish Agricultural Agency is in the process of implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1009 of the 5 \nJune 2019 regarding laying down rules on the mak ing available on the market of EU fertilising \nproducts . This regulation includes quality management systems and standards for compost quality \n(Miljøministeriet, 2022) .\nSummary result      \n\nLegally binding n ational\nstandards for\ncompost/digestate quality but\nno quality management\nsystem\nDenmark has legally binding national standards for compost quality . The\nbio -waste needs to comply with certain limit values before being used in\na composting and/or biogas process.\nRobustness of the underlying\ninformation The information is based on legal standards.\n\n2.2 Target for the recycling of p ackaging waste\nThis chapter aims at assessing the prospects of Denmark to achieve the 65 % recycling target for \npackaging waste in 2025  as well as the material specific packaging waste recycling targets (50 % of \nplastic; 25 % of wood; 70 % of ferrous metals; 50 % of aluminium; 70 % of glass; 75 % of paper and \ncardboard) . In order to conclude on this likelihood, the analysis takes stock of the status of several \nfactors that are proven to influence the levels of recycling in a country. For a detailed description of \nthe methodology followed, the development of success/risk factors and their impact on recycling, \nplease consult the methodology report (ETC/CE & ETC/WMGE, 2022) .\n2.2.1 Current situation and past trends \nSRF P -1.1 Distance to target \nThe actual distance to the target for the most recent data point is a key factor determining the \nlikelihood of meeting or not meeting the target. This analysis is based on data reported by Denmark \nto Eurostat in accordance with Commission Decision 2005/270 /EC as last amended by the Commission \nImplementing Decision 2019/665 (EC, 2019) , published in the da taset Recycling rates of packaging \nwaste for monitoring compliance with policy targets, by type of packaging [env_waspacr] . The latest \navailable data refers to 2019 . The performance of Denmark for 2019 is illustrated in Figure 2.2.\nFigure 2.2 Packaging recycling rates for Denmark in 201 9, in percentage \nNote : No data available for ferrous and aluminium packaging, only for metallic packaging .\nSource : Eurostat (2022c) , EU (2018) \nFor Denmark the reported recycling rates exceed the targets for all packaging materials except of \nplastic s packaging . For total packaging, the recycling exceeds the target by 5.4 percentage poin ts, f or \npaper and cardboard packaging by 22. 7 percentage point s, for glass by 1.1 percentage points , and for \nwooden packaging by 32.4 percentage points. For metals, the reported rates do not make a distinction \nbetween ferrous metals and aluminium, but the total recycling rate for metals ( 61.3 %) still exceeds the rec ycling target for aluminium , but not for ferrous metals . For plastic s packaging, the reported \nrecycling rate is 12.6 percentage points below the target (Eurostat, 2022c) .\nHowever, the recycling rates presented are based on the calculation rules of the Commission Decision \n2005/270 before it was amended by the Commission Implementing Decision 2019/665 and will likely \ndiffer from the recycling rates to be reported according to the new calculation rules . The new \ncalculation rules will only be mandatory to be used for the reference year 2020 and onwards. A key \ndifference in the new calculation rules compared to the old rules is that the amount of sorted \npackaging waste that is rejected by the recycling faci lity shall not be included in the reported amount \nof recycled packaging waste. \nDenmark has carried out a preliminary assessment of the impact of the new calculation rules. \nCurrently, the reported data refer to packaging waste collected for recycling and the final recycling \nrate will refer to the output of recycling. The Danish government has estimat ed final recycling rates \nfor the year 2018 by accounting for average loss rates per waste type (Danish Environmental \nProtection Agency, 2021) . If the same reduction in the rates (in percentage points) are used to \ncalculate the impact of the new calculation rules to the repo rted data for the year 2019, the recycling \nrates would decrease as follows :\n• Paper and cardboard packaging waste by 3 per cent points from 99.7 % to 96.7 %\n• Metal packaging waste by 10 per cent points from 61.3 % to 51.3 %\n• Glass packaging waste by 3 per cent points from 71.1 % to 68.1 %\n• Plastic packaging waste by 17 per cent points from 37.4 % to 20.4 %\n• Wood packaging waste by 4 per cent points from 57.4 % to 53.4 %\n• Total packaging: Calculated based on the amounts of each p ackaging material generated and \nrecycled in 201 9, the recycling rate would drop from 70.4 % to 64.1 %. \nThe waste generation data includes also privately imported packaging , and for plastics and \npaper/cardboard also estimates for online sales (Eurostat, 2020b) .\nIt is likely that the currently reported recycling rate of 99.7 % is overestimated for paper and cardboard \npackaging. The latest Danish composition analysis of mixed household waste (Miljøstyrelsen, 2018) \nfound that 3.1 % of this waste was cardboard, corresponding to around 3 1 000 tonnes in 2017 (the \nsame study reports the amount of mixed household waste to be 995 000 tonnes).

Packaging waste is under the same administration as \nmunicipal waste . However, t he implementation process for setting up a general EPR scheme has \nstarted (see Section 2.1.5) , with the aim to transfer the responsibility for packaging recycl ing to the \nproducers . The EPR scheme for packaging will be introduced no later than 31 December 2024 and will \ninclude all types of packaging in all types of materials. Decisions about the organisation and \nadministrative setup for the EPR system have not yet been made and thus fort hcoming responsibilities \nfor meeting the packaging waste targets in Denmark are not fully defined .Summary result \nUnclear responsibilities, \nweak/no enforcement \nmechanisms and lack of \nsupport tools for meeting the \nrecycling targets \nDenmark has planned to implement an EPR scheme for packaging waste \nby the end of 2024, but the configuration of the scheme , enforcement and \nsupport mechanisms are not yet defined .\nRobustness of the underlying \ninformation \nReliable information provided by the Danish authorities in the EEA -\nETC/WM GE questionnaire.

Such systems generally deliver better results the more convenient \nand accessible they are for their users, also compared to the collection of residual waste. The material \nspecific assessment considers packaging was te from both household and non -household sources.

The assessment takes \nthe different situations for different types of materials into account: Plastics packaging is the \npackaging material that is the most difficult to recycle out o f the packaging materials targeted by the \nPackaging and Packaging Waste Directive. Fee modulation therefore plays a larger role for plastic \npackaging than for the other materials and is therefore rated differently from paper/cardboard, \nferrous metals, alum inium and glass . The methodology foresees a green score for plastics packaging \nonly if all four fee modulation assessment criteria mentioned above are met . On the other hand, \nwooden packaging is mainly generated by commercial and industrial sources and fee modulation is \nless relevant, therefore the methodology only relies on EPR schemes for wooden packaging from \ncommercial and industrial sources. \nAs described in Section  2.1.5  in more detail, Denmark has no EPR scheme s for packaging waste yet .\nDenmark has a deposit return system for beverage packaging made of plastic, glass or aluminium \nwhich operates similar to an EPR scheme as described above .Summary result \nSRF P-5.3.1 \nEPR scheme for Paper \nand cardboard \npackaging waste \nNo EPR scheme  Denmark has no EPR schemes yet .\nSRF P-5.3.2 \nEPR scheme for Ferrous \nmetals packaging waste \nNo EPR scheme  Denmark has no EPR schemes yet .\nSRF P-5.3.3 \nEPR scheme for \nAluminium packaging \nwaste \nNo EPR scheme  Denmark has no EPR schemes yet .\nSRF P-5.3.4 \nEPR scheme for Glass \npackaging waste \nNo EPR scheme  Denmark has no EPR schemes yet .\nSRF P-5.3.5 \nEPR scheme for Plastic \npackaging waste \nNo EPR scheme  Denmark has no EPR schemes yet .\nSRF P-5.3.6 \nEPR scheme for \nWooden packaging \nwaste \nNo EPR scheme  Denmark has no EPR schemes yet .\nRobustness of the underlying information \nCredible information received from the Danish \nauthorities through the EEA -ETC/WMGE \nquestionnaire. 34 \n2.3 Target on l andfill of municipal waste\n2.3.1 Current situation and past trends \nSRF L F-1.1 : Distance to target \nThe Landfill Directive ( 1999/31/EC ), as amended by Directive (EU) 2018/850, sets a target to \nreduce , by 2035, the amount of municipal waste landfilled to 10 % or less of the total amount \nof municipal waste generated (by weight). \nData to show the current rate of landfilling in line with the reporting rules will only be reported \nby mid -2022. Therefore, this analysis ca lculates the landfilling rate based on the current Eurostat \ndataset Municipal waste by waste management operations [env_wasmun] ; by dividing the \namount of landfilled waste by the total amount of waste generated. The overall landfilling rate \nof Denmark was 0.9 % in 2020 (Eurostat, 2022a) . Denmark has a very high incineration capacity, \nroughly double the amount of municipal waste sent to incineration , and thus landfill rates are \nexpected to stay at a low level also in the future (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, \n2021) .\nSummary result      \n\nTarget exceeded The landfilling rate of Denmark was slightly below 1 % in 2020.\nRobustness of the\nunderlying information\nThe data is derived from Eurostat and is considered to be rather\nrobust.

T here is no break in the time series data. \nSRF LF -1.3: Diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from landfill \nAccording to Art. 5(2c) of the EU Landfill Directive, Member States had to ensure that by 2016, \nbiodegradable municipal waste going to landfills is reduced to 35 % of the total amount (by \nweight) of biodegradable municipal waste produced in 1995 or the lat est year before 1995 for \nwhich standardised Eurostat data is available. \nDenmark reported 0 % biodegradable waste landfilled in 2019 as share of the biodegradable \nwaste generated in 1995 , and performs therefore well within the target (EC, 2021) .\nSummary result \nTarget for reducing the \namount of biodegradable \nmunicipal waste (BMW) \nlandfilled to 35% of BMW \ngenerated in 1995 has been \nachieved in 2016 \nDenmark has reported 0 % biodegradable waste landfilled in 2019 as \nshare of the biodegradable waste generated in 1995 and performs \ntherefore well within the target. \nRobustness of the \nunderlying information \nBased on officially reported data which is well in line with otherwise \nreported statistical data on landfilling of municipal was te. 3 Conclusion \nTh is risk assessment indicate s whether Denmark at risk of not meeting the target s. The ‘total \nrisk’ categorization is the result of the sum of the individual scores of each SRF as described in \nthe previous chapter , where the assessment of each SRF results in a score of 2 points (green), 1 \npoint (amber) or 0 points (red) , depending on the assessment of the SRF. As some SRFs are \nconsidered to have a higher impact on meeting the ta rget, the score of the SRF is multiplied by \nthe defined weight of the SRF. As some SRFs might not be applicable to Denmark , only the SRFs \nrelevant to Denmark are taken into account to define the maximum score. Denmark is \nconsidered to be ‘not at risk’ if i ts score is more than 50 % of this maximum score , and ‘at risk’ \nif its score is less than 50 % of this maximum score .\n3.1 Prospects for meeting the recycling target for municipal solid waste\n65 %\nof maximum score \nBased on the provided information and the ana lysis done, \nit is concluded that Denmark is not at risk for not meeting \nthe municipal waste recycling target in 2025 .\nCurrent situation and past \ntrends :\nThe recycling rate was at 53.9 % in 2020 , which is 1.1 \npercentage points below the 2025 target. Considering, \nhowever, the impact of the new calculation rules, Denmark \nhas estimated the impact of the application of the new \ncalculation rules on the recycling rate, with the result that \nthe recycling rate would drop by 8 percentag e points, to \n45.9 %, or 9.1 percentage points below the target .\nDenmark has an increasing trend in recycling; t he recycling \nrate has increased with 5.6 percentage points during the \npast five years. \nLegal instruments :\nThe amended WFD has been transposed into national law \nin Denmark by the transposition deadline .\nDenmark reports clearly defined responsibilities, as well as \nclearly defined enforcement mechanisms for meeting the \ntargets on recycling of municipal waste, in addition \nDenmark also pre sents support mechanisms to improve \nthe implementation of the responsible entities. \nEconomic instruments :\nThere is a landfill ban for biodegradable waste and high \ntax es on both landfilling and incineration .\nDenmark has a policy for municipal waste collection which \nallows for the possibility of PAYT -schemes but \nmunicipalities often do not implement PAYT .Separate collection systems :\nA high share of population is covered by high convenience \ncollection services for paper and cardboard , metals, wood ,\nglass , plastics and WEEE . A medium share of population is \ncovered by high convenience collection services for bio -\nwaste . A low share of pop ulation is covered by high \nconvenience collection services for textiles. \nBy the end of 2022 at the latest , high convenience separate \ncollection of all examined fractions except wood waste and \nWEEE will be mandatory in all municipalities in Denmark, \nwhich w ill improve the service level and can be expected to \nincrease the capture rates of recyclables and recycling \nrates. \nExtended producer \nresponsibility :\nThe implementation process for setting up an EPR scheme \nhas started. The implementation of an EPR scheme, \ncovering all main packaging materials, is expected to have \na positive impact on the separate collection of packaging \nwaste which will, in turn, also i mpact the capture rates and \nrecycling of municipal waste .\nBio -waste treatment capacity \nand quality management :\nIncreasing the bio -waste treatment capacity is required in \norder to meet the increasing volumes of separately \ncollected bio -waste. The Danish au thorities report the \nrequired capacity demand for the treatment of biowaste \nwill be covered by the private sector or the municipalities. \nDenmark has legally binding national standards for \ncompost quality , but no quality management system yet .3.2 Prospects for meeting the recycling target s for packaging waste \n76 %\nof maximum score \nBased on the provided information and the analysis done, it is \nconcluded that Denmark is not at risk for not meeting the 65 \n% recycling target for packaging waste in 2025 \n84 % of maximum score  Paper and cardboard  Not at risk \n45 % of maximum score  Ferrous metals packaging  At risk \n84 % of maximum score  Aluminium packaging  Not at risk \n82 % of maximum score  Glass  packaging  Not at risk \n46 % of maximum score  Plastics packaging  At risk \n78 % of maximum score  Wooden packaging  Not at risk \nCurrent situation and past \ntrends :\nThe total packaging recycling rate (applying the new \ncalculation rules) in 2019 was 64.1 % , 0.9 percentage points \nbelow the 2025 target. \nThere was a small trend of decreasing recycling rates for the \nperiod 2015 -2019 , and the recycling rate in 2019 was lower \nthan in 2015. \nPlastic s and ferrous packaging waste is more than 15 \npercentage points below the target , once losses during sor ting \nand recycling are taken into account . One of t he main reasons \nfor the poor performance on plastics packaging might be that \nplastics sorting at source is still new to Danish citizens. \nLegal instruments :\nThe amended Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive has \nbeen transposed into national law .\nResponsibilities for meeting the packaging waste targets are \nplanned to change with the introduction of EPR for packaging, \nhowever the organisational set -up for the EPR scheme for \npackaging is to be decided , and enforcement and support \nmechanisms are therefore not yet clear .\nEconomic instruments :\nThere is a landfill ban for biodegradable waste and a high tax \non incineration .\nDenmark applies taxes on packaging .\nThere is a policy for municipal waste collection which allows \nfor the possibility of PAYT -schemes but municipalities often do \nnot implement PAYT .\nDenmark has a mandatory DRS is in place for all aluminium \ncans, plastic and glass bottles and a voluntary DRS for some \nspecific plastic crates. There is no DRS for wooden packaging. Separate collection \nsystems :\nAs of July 2021 and by end of 2022 at the latest , door -to -door \nor high convenience bring point separate collection of all \npackaging m aterials except wood waste will be mandatory in \nall municipalities in Denmark, aiming to further improve the \nservice level and increase the collection rates for packaging \nwaste. \nThe need for improvement and introduction of additional \nmandatory separate co llection requirements are a sign of the \ndata on rate of collection for recycling for paper and \ncardboard not being accurate, indicating also that the data for \nother packaging waste recycling may not be robust. \nSeparat ion at source is mandatory in Denmark for both \nhouseholds and also for companies. \nExtended producer \nresponsibility :\nDenmark does not have an EPR scheme for packaging yet. \nDenmark has a deposit return system covering beverage \npackaging, which operates similar to an EPR -scheme . The \nprocess for setting up an EPR scheme for all packaging has \nstarted and it is intended to be introduced no later than 31 \nDecember 2024 . It will cover all types of packaging in all types \nof materials .\n3.3 Prospects of meeting the landfill o f municipal waste target\n100 %\nof maximum score \nBased on the provided information and the analysis done, it is \nconcluded that Denmark is  not at risk  for not meeting the \n2035 target  to reduce  the amount of munic ipal waste \nlandfilled to 10 % or less of the total amount of municipal \nwaste generated. \nCurrent situation and past \ntrends :\nThe landfilling rate in 2020 was 0.9 %. \nOver the past five years, the overall landfilling rate of \nDenmark was about 1 % . K eeping the low landfilling rate \nshould be no problem due to the high incineration capacity in \nDenmark. \nDiversion of biodegradable \nmunicipal waste from \nlandfill :\nDenmark reported 0 % biodegradable waste landfilled in 201 9\nin as share of the biodegradable waste generated in 1995 , and \nperforms therefor e well within the targe t.List of abbreviations \nAbbreviation  Name \nDRS  Deposit Return System \nEC  European Commission \nEEA  European Environment Agency \nEEE  Electrical and Electronic Equipment \nEionet  European Environmental Information and Observation Network \nEPR  Extended producer responsibility \nETC/CE  European Topic Centre on Circular Economy and resource use \nETC/WMGE  European Topic Centre on Waste and Materials in a Green Economy \nMBT  Mechanical biological treatment \nMS  Member state \nMSW  Municipal solid waste \nNWMP  National Waste Management Plan \nPAYT  Pay -as -you -throw \nPET  Polyethylene terephthalate \nPOM  Put on the market \nPPWD  Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive \nPRO  Producer Responsibility Organisation \nPVC  Polyvinyl chloride \nRR  Recycling rate \nSRF  Success and risk factor \nSUP  Single Use Plastic \nTOC  Total Organic Carbon \nWEEE  Waste Electric and Electronic Equipment \nWFD  Waste Framework Directive References \nDAKOFA, 2021, ‘Nyhed: Forbehandlingsanlæg til biopulp af madaffald’ \n(https://dakofa.dk/element/forbehandlingsanlaeg -til -biopulp -af -madaffald/) accessed 21 June \n\n\n\nDanish Environ mental Protection Agency, 2021, Questionnaire to Member States for providing \ninformation into the Early Warning analyses – Denmark. \nDanish Ministry of the Environment, 2013, Waste incineration – recovery of energy and material \nresources, \n(https://eng.ecoi nnovation.dk/media/mst/8051413/Affald_Case_Forbr%C3%A6nding_web_15 \n.01.13.pdf) accessed 18 June 2021. \nDanish Waste Association, 2021, ‘Danish symbols for waste sorting’ \n(https://danskaffaldsforening.dk/the -danish -pictograms -waste -sorting) accessed 22 June 2 021. \nDeloitte and Incentive, 2015, Kortlægning af gebyrstrukturer på affaldsområdet og analyse af \ngebyrer, der understøtter ressourcestrategiens mål om mere genanvendelse ,\nMiljøministeriet/Miljøstyrelsen (https://genanvend.mst.dk/media/131206/kortlaegnin g-af -\ngebyrstrukturer -paa -affaldsomraadet -final -2.pdf) accessed 11 February 2022. \nEC, 2019, Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/665 of 17 April 2019 amending Decision \n2005/270/EC establishing the formats relating to the database system pursuant to Eu ropean \nParliament and Council Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste (notified under \ndocument C(2019) 2805) (Text with EEA relevance.)

However, the recycling percentage decreased from 2009 to 2010. The main reason for this seems to be the change in the scope of municipal waste due to the new regulation on recyclable waste from enterprises. Therefore it will require an increased effort to reach a 50 % recycling level by 2020 based on 2010 data  The major initiatives to improve MSW in Denmark were taken before 2001, i.e. landfill ban, landfill and incineration tax, separate collection schemes. 4 1 Introduction 1.1 Objective Based on historical MSW data for Denmark and EU targets linked to MSW, the analysis undertaken includes:  The historical performance on MSW management based on a set of indicators;  Uncertainties that might explain differences between the countries’ performance which are more linked to differences of what the reporting includes than differences in management performance;  Relation of the indicators to the most important initiatives taken to improve MSW management in the country; and  Assessment of the future possible trends and achieving of the future EU targets on MSW by 2020. 2 Denmark’s MSW management performance Danish waste management has progressed in leaps and bounds from its initial focus on the protection of human health, through the integration of environmental protection, to the extraction and recovery of resources in waste. This transformation has occurred thanks to a dedicated and thorough policy regime that draws in key actors and assigns clear responsibilities. In the 1970s, landfilling and dumping of waste on sites lacking any kind environmental protection was still the most common waste disposal practice in Denmark. Landfill was still so common in the 1980s that the landfill capacity was exhausted in the Copenhagen region. The generation and disposal of waste in Denmark was first mapped in 1985. This showed that 39 % of all waste and 33 % of household waste ended in landfills. This percentage was reduced for household waste to 19 % by 1995 and to 4 % by 2008, while recycling and incineration has simultaneously increased; waste is now seen as a resource to be recovered. As a consequence, many landfills receive so little waste that it is no longer economically viable to keep them fully operational (ETC/SCP, 2012, Fischer et al., 2012). The first national Waste Plan was developed in 1992, covering the period 1993-97. It included targets for all waste concerning recycling, incineration and landfilling (Fischer et al., 2012). Since then two plans covering the period 1998-2004 and 2005-2008 were developed and implemented. The current plan, the ‘Danish Waste Plan 2009-2012’, is the fourth national waste plan. 2.1 MSW Indicators Management of MSW in Denmark is characterized by a high degree of incineration, amounting to 54 % in 2010. It is the highest percentage and the highest amount per capita in EU-27 (Eurostat, 2012). 5 Figure 2.0 MSW generation per capita in Denmark 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Kilograms per capita MSW generation in Denmark for the period 2001-2010 Source: Eurostat, 2012 Denmark defines municipal waste as all waste from households as this waste is always collected by a municipal collection scheme and in addition fractions similar to household waste from the primary source ‘Institutions, Commerce and Offices’ as these fractions are also collected by a municipal scheme in Denmark (Marcher, 2005). The generation of MSW in Denmark (Figure 2.0) topped in 2008 with 830 kg/capita and has since decreased to 762 kg/capita in 2009 and to 673 kg/capita in 2010 based on Eurostat data. It is important to notice that the data for 2010 are estimates based on the 2009 data (Møller 2012, personal communication). The 2010 data have not yet been released by the Danish Environmental Agency. The reason is the introduction of a new data reporting system in 2010, which required more validation than expected. The larger decline of 12 % in MSW generation per capita from 2009 to 2010 (Figure 2) is due to change in the waste regulation per 1 January 2010 (Statutory order on waste 2010), which changed the definition of waste regarded as MSW. All enterprises are responsible for recycling of their recyclable waste under the new regulation. In the past, the municipalities had more duties and authorities regarding recyclable waste from private enterprises. The change in regulation resulted in the municipalities no longer having responsibility for ensuring that sufficient recycling capacity is available either at publicly or privately owned plants for waste from institutions, commerce and offices. The 2009 MSW data showed a total 4 206 000 tonnes, of which 3 437 000 tonnes was household waste and 769 000 tonnes was municipal waste from the service sector ‘Institutions, Commerce and Offices’. The estimated data reported to Eurostat for 2010 is based on the 2009 data. However, due to the change in the waste regulation it is assumed that 474 000 tonnes of waste from the service sector collected for recycling is no longer the municipalities’ responsibility and is therefore outside the scope of municipal waste (Møller 2012, personal communication). 2.1.1 The recycling of MSW from 2001 to 2010 Figure 2.1 shows the development of recycling of MSW in Denmark related to total recycling, material recycling and organic recycling (compost and other biological treatment). Figure 2.1 6 illustrates a positive trend in the recycling of MSW from 2001 to 2009. The total recycling increased from 36 % in 2001 to 49 % in 2009. However, the level of recycling decreased to 42 % in 2010. The decrease from 2009 to 2010 is explained by the change in the scope of municipal waste due to the new regulation on recyclable waste from enterprises as explained above. The increase of recycling from 2001 to 2008 is first of all linked to material recycling which has increased from 23 % in 2004 to 34 % in 2008 - or in absolute amounts from 799 000 tonnes to 1 559 000 tonnes. However, a decrease in material recycling is found for both 2009 and 2010, and only 23 % of the MSW consisted of material recycling in 2010. The major increase in material recycling waste took place between 2007 and 2008, which represented an increase from 26 % to 34 %. Most of this increase (80 %) can be explained by increased generation and recycling of iron and other metal in households. In 2007, 76 000 tons of iron and other metal was reported, and 410 000 tonnes was reported in 2008, an increase of more than 500 % (Table 2.1). The Danish EPA explains that the increase is due to one undisclosed enterprise that reported this amount collected from households (Miljøstyrelsen, 2010). Organic recycling has only increased from 14 % to 19 % in 10 years, equivalent to an increase from 483 000 tonnes to 720 000 tonnes. The main part of the organic waste recycled is garden waste from households (Table 2.1). In conclusion, there is room for improvement of both material and organic recycling, but material recycling in particular. Figure 2.1 Recycling of MSW in Denmark Source: Eurostat, 2012. The percentages are calculated as % of generated MSW. 7 Table 2.1 Main waste fractions of household waste collected for recycling (1000 tonnes) in Denmark 2000 2002 2004 2006 2007 2008 2009 Paper, paper packaging 181 204 221 211 246 207 221 Glass 83 111 88 85 91 65 98 Plastic 2 5 4 4 5 4 5 Metal 17 25 25 31 76 410 313 Green kitchen waste 45 37 53 41 43 38 50 Garden waste 505 512 495 592 640 527 611 Date source: SAG-database 2009 and Miljøstyrelsen 2011 2.1.2 The yearly increase rate of recycling of MSW In order to assess the prospects for Denmark to meet the 50 % recycling target as set out in the Waste Framework Directive1, three scenarios have been calculated. The scenarios assume that recycling in the period 2010 to 2020 develops, based on a linear regression, with the increase rates of recycling in the periods 2001 to 2006, 2006 to 2010 and 2001 to 2010. Figure 2.2 shows that if the increase of recycling follows the trend from 2001 to 2010 or 2001 to 2005, Denmark would be able to fulfil the recycling target of 50 % by 2020. However, if the recycling follows the most recent trends from 2006-2010 then Denmark would not be able to fulfil the target in 2020. Since Denmark has had a very low yearly increase rate of 0.6 percentage point in the period from 2006 to 2010, it will require an increased effort to reach a 50 % recycling level by 2020. It has to be noticed that the data for 2010 is based on 2009 data and that the scope of municipal waste has changed dramatically from 2009 to 2010. Therefore, comparison of data between 2009 and 2010 may not be fair. 1 EU’s updated Waste Framework Directive from 2008 (EU, 2008) includes a new 50 % recycling target for waste from households, to be fulfilled by 2020. In 2011, the European Commission decided that countries can choose between four different calculation methods to report compliance with this target. One of these methods is to calculate the recycling rate of MSW as reported to Eurostat (EC, 2011). 8 Figure 2.2 Future recycling of MSW in Denmark Source: Calculation done by Copenhagen Resource Institute (CRI) based on Eurostat, 2012 Please note that these three scenarios are very simplistic and do not take into account any planned policy measures. In addition, they are based on one calculation methodology for recycling of municipal waste (MSW recycled/MSW generated, using data reported to Eurostat), whereas countries may choose to use another methodology to calculate compliance with the 50 % recycling target of the Waste Framework Directive. The scenarios in Figure 2.2 should therefore be interpreted only as to give some rough indications and assessment of the risk of missing the target. 2.1.3 Landfilling of biodegradable municipal waste According to the EU Landfill Directive, it is a general requirement that all Member States have to reduce the amount of biodegradable municipal waste landfilled (BMW) with a certain percentage by 2006, 2009 and 2016. Denmark has reported the landfilled amount of BMW to the Commission for the year 2006. The amount of BMW landfilled is far below the targets for 2006, 2009 and 2016. The amount landfilled in 2006 was 2 % of the BMW generated in 1995. In 1997, Denmark implemented a landfill ban on biodegradable MSW. Denmark reported to the EU Commission in 2009 that the amount of biodegradable MSW in Denmark has been for many years 1-2 % of the amount landfilled in 1995 (Miljøstyrelsen, 2009). 9 Figure 2.3 Landfilling of biodegradable MSW in Denmark (% of BMW generated in 1995) 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 2006 2007* 2008 2009 2010 Landfilling of biodegradable MSW in Denmark Landfilling of biodegradable municipal waste (BMW) in % of BMW generated in 1995 Target 2006 Target 2009 Target 2016 Ban of landfilling of biodegradable MSW in Denmark Source: EC, 2012 * Data missing 2.1.4 Regional differences of MSW recycling from 2001 to 2010 No regional data for Denmark has been reported to Eurostat. 2.1.5 The relation between landfill tax level and recycling level of MSW The Danish Landfill tax was introduced on 1 January 1987 along with the introduction of a tax on incineration. The aim was to create an incentive to help reduce the amount of waste going to landfills and incineration plants and so promote recycling (ETC/SCP, 2012). Originally, the landfill tax included only landfills receiving waste from municipal collection schemes, but already by 1989 coverage was extended to all landfills with the exception of landfills for hazardous waste. In 1987, the tax was DKK 40 per ton of waste (~EUR 5.3). The tax was increased several times during the 1990s; to DKK 160 in 1993 (~EUR 21.3), DKK 335 in 1997 (~EUR 44.7), DKK 375 (~EUR 50) in 1999 and DKK 475 (~EUR 63.3) in 2010. The tax is levied on waste delivered to registered plants and a refund is granted for waste that is subsequently removed, e.g. for recycling. In that way, the tax is only paid for the net amount received (ETC/SCP, 2012). In the period from 1985 to 2008, the absolute amount of household waste sent to landfill declined by 0.5 million tonnes, equivalent to a reduction of 77 %. The landfill tax has played a role in this reduction, together with other measures such as a ban on the landfilling of combustible waste. 10 Figure 2.5 Development of landfilling and incineration of MSW and landfill tax in Denmark Source: ETC/SCP, 2012 and Eurostat, 2012 The landfill tax seems to have had little impact on landfilling in the last 10 years as landfilling in 2001 was already at a low level (Figure 2.5). The landfilling rate has decreased from 7.5 % to 3.5 % from 2001 to 2010. The effect of the increase in landfill tax from 2009 and 2010 is not reflected in the data for landfilling for the same years; 3.1 % in 2009 and 3.5 % in 2010. The percentage of incineration of MSW waste has decreased from 2001 to 2009. The explanation is not linked to the landfill tax rather it might be the effect of the incineration tax in Denmark. No correlation between recycling and the tax rate can be demonstrated for 2001 to 2010 (Figure 2.6). Figure 2.6 Development of MSW recycling and landfill tax in Denmark Source: ETC/SCP, 2012 and Eurostat, 2012 The tax has been stable from 2001 to 2009 while recycling has increased during the same time period. 11 2.1.6 Environmental benefits of better MSW management Figure 2.7 shows the development of GHG emissions from MSW management, calculated by using a life-cycle approach. The graph shows the direct emissions, the avoided emissions and the net emissions of the MSW management. Figure 2.7 indicates a steady decrease of direct emissions from landfilling from 1990 to 2010. Since 1996, waste management in Denmark in total has had a negative net emission of GHG, that means that benefits (avoided emissions) from recycling and incineration are higher than direct emissions from landfills, incineration, recycling plants and MSW transport. If avoided emissions are higher than direct emissions, one could conclude that it would be better for the environment to generate and recycle more waste. That is of course not the case. The reason is that the model only focuses on waste management and not the full production chain and its consequences in a life-cycle perspective. Therefore, the increasing consumption of goods (and resulting generation of more municipal solid waste) is more harmful for the environment, if all life-cycle stages of materials were to be taken into account (ETC/SCP, 2011). The reasonably large increase of net GHG emissions from 2009 to 2010 has to be seen as a consequence of reduced recycling due to the scope of municipal waste has changed dramatically from 2009 to 2010, cf. section 2.1 and 2.1.2. Figure 2.7 GHG emissions from MSW management in Denmark -5000 -4000 -3000 -2000 -1000 0 1000 2000 3000 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 x1000 tonnes CO2-eq Year Recycling - Avoided Incineration - Avoided Landfilling - Avoided Transport - Direct Recycling - Direct Incineration - Direct Landfilling - Direct Net Results presented in Figure 2.7 should not be used for the compilation of GHG reporting (national inventory report of the IPCC) or compared with IPCC figures, as the methodology employed here relies on life cycle thinking and, by definition, differs from the IPCC methodology. 12 Assumptions concerning the production of Figure 2.7 All the GHG emissions (positive values) represent the direct operating emissions for each waste management option. These direct operating emissions have been calculated with the use of the IPCC (IPCC, 2006) methodology for landfills and life cycle modelling for the other technologies (incineration, recycling, bio-treatment and transport). For the indirect avoided emissions (negative values), the calculations integrate the benefits associated with the recovery of energy (heat and electricity generated by incinerators, electricity generated by the combustion of landfill gas or methane from anaerobic digestion). Other avoided emissions include the benefits of recycling of food and garden waste, paper, glass, metals, plastics, textiles and wood in the municipal solid waste. Recycling is here assumed to include material recycling and bio-treatment. Avoided emissions of bio-treatment includes fertilizer substitution. All processes generating electricity are assumed to substitute electricity mix of Denmark in 2009 (IEA, 2009). Processes generating heat are assumed to substitute average heat mix for the EU-25 in 2002. The electricity mix and heat mix are assumed to remain constant throughout the whole time series. The compositions of the MSW disposed in landfills, incinerated or recycled respectively are based ETC/SCP (2011). In an Eionet consultation process, initiated by the EEA in 2012, Denmark updated the compositions of the landfilled and recycled MSW for 2009. The complete methodology is available from (ETC/SCP, 2011) 2.2 Uncertainties in the reporting Some uncertainties or differences included in the reporting of MSW can result in different recycling levels. One example of such differences is the amount or proportion of packaging waste included. It seems that there are some major differences regarding how much recycling of packaging waste the different Member States include in their reporting of MSW. This difference is due to the fact that most Member States have producer responsibility schemes and the packaging waste is therefore not always regarded or reported to Eurostat as MSW. Denmark does not have producer responsibility for packaging, and data for recycling of packaging waste are included in the municipal waste. Figure 2.8 indicates that packaging waste is included in the material recycled MSW reported. Until 2009, a more detailed reporting system had been used for the recycling of packaging as the general waste statistic does not deliver data on packaging recycling in sufficient quality. One of the aims of the new data system for waste introduced in 2010 was to improve the data quality for recycling of packaging. 13 Figure 2.8 Comparison of packaging waste recycled and MSW recycled 0 200 400 600 800 1,000 1,200 1,400 1,600 1,800 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Recycling in 1000 tonnes Relation between the amount of recycling of packaging waste and MSW in Denmark Amount of material recycled MSW Amount of recycled packaging waste Source: Eurostat, 2012. Another uncertainty or difference in the reporting of MSW is caused by different reporting of waste treated at MBT plants. However, MBT plants are not part of the Danish waste management system and therefore not widespread in Denmark. 2.3 Important initiatives taken to improve MSW management The major initiatives to improve MSW management in Denmark were taken before 2001. The landfill tax and incineration tax introduced in 1987 and the total ban on the landfilling of combustible waste (decided in 1994 and coming into effect on 1 January 1997) have been the main drivers for treatment of municipal waste in Denmark (Fischer et al., 2012). In addition, the establishment of separate collection schemes for paper, glass packaging, and garden waste has contributed significantly to the increased level of recycling. Minor initiatives have been taken to improve MSW management from 2001 to 2010. The second national Danish Waste Plan 1998-2004 (Waste 21) set a target of 60 % recycling of paper and cardboard waste from households. Municipalities were obliged to introduce separate containers at each household for paper waste if the municipalities were performing under a certain collection rate (Regeringen, 1999). The potential in tonnes is huge. However, the data for collected paper from households have been quite stable from 2000 to 2009 (Miljøstyrelsen, 2011). During the last decade the recycling centres for household waste run by the municipalities have been expanded and more waste types can be delivered at the recycling centres. The third national Danish Waste Plan 2005-2008 implemented the targets in the EU Directive for packaging and packaging waste to be fulfilled in 2008. A few initiatives focused on municipal waste. The municipalities had to implement collection schemes for metal packaging and certain types of plastic packaging (Regeringen, 2003). The introduction of a deposit system for one way beverages packaging in 2002 increased the amount of plastic and metal packaging waste and the amount of recycling. However, the potential in tonnes for these schemes are quite small and it is not expected to influence the total recycling of municipal waste. 14 Figure 2.9 Recycling of MSW in Denmark and important policy initiatives The fourth national Danish Waste Plan 2009-2012 did not focus on new initiatives for recycling of municipal waste except a target for collection of batteries (Regeringen, 2009). 2.4 Future possible trends Denmark is drafting a new waste management plan covering 2013-2018. The draft is planned for consultation after the summer 2012. It is expected that the plan will include initiatives to fulfil the 50 % target of recycling and prepare for reuse for household waste 2020 (Article 11 (2) in the WFD. The indicator in Figure 2.2 demonstrated that based on the recent years’ development in recycling (2006-2010), Denmark will face problems in reaching the target in 2020. It also has to be noted that the data for 2010 is based on 2009 data and that the scope of municipal waste was changed dramatically from 2009 to 2010. Therefore, the comparison of data between 2009 and 2010 may not be fair. In addition, there is a need to have a closer look on the data for the amount of recycled metals from household waste. In 2009, the amount of recycled metals in household waste totalled up to 313 000 tonnes, yet the total amount of household waste was 3 437 000 tonnes. In other words, 9 % of the household waste consisted of metals collected for recycling. This seems to be a very high percentage compared to other European countries where 5 % was the highest amount of metal in municipal waste (UNEP, 2004).

The action plan was drafted in 2020 and \nsent for consultation in December 2020. The final plan was \npublished Ju ne 2021. \nThe Action Plan for Circular Economy describes the Danish \ntargets, indicators, policies and initiatives in the entire circular \nvalue chain, which ranges from design and consumption to \nwaste management, from which natural resources are \nrecycled into new products and materials. \n\nForeseen budget for \n\nimplementation of the project \nNo specific budget for the implementation of the programme is \nincluded in the programme. \nWASTE GENERATION The following figures illustrate the progress towards waste prevention and decoupling of waste \ngeneration from economic growth in Denmark :\nMSW  \n\n•\n\nThe generation of municipal waste per capita (see Figure 1) increased from 740 kg per capita \nin 2006 and reach ed its maximum in 201 1 with 862 kg per capita. The trend stagnated after \n2011 and 20 12 -2019 waste generation has remained on the same level 810 -840 kg/capita and \nyear , and in 2020 this dropped somewhat to 814 kg. Denmark’s waste generation is thereby \none of the highest in Europe , compared to the 2020 per capita European average of 517 kg 1. \n\n•\n\nThe first WPP of Denmark came into force in 2013 and, although MSW generation is \ninfluenced by many factors ( e.g. household expenditure), the prevention measures in that \nWPP might partially explain the stable trend in waste generation. To note is that household \nexpenditure increased steadily during the same period 2, thus some decoupling effect may have \noccurred. \nFigure 1: Municipal waste generation in Denmark (kg per capita) , 2006 -20 20 (data unavailable in \n2010) \nSource: Eurostat [ENV_WASMUN] \nTotal waste  \n\n•\n\nDenmark ´s waste generation (excluding major mineral wastes) has fluctuated from 2010 to \n2020 but decreased overall by 4% (see Figure 2). During the same period , Denmark’s GDP \ngrew steadily . \n\n•\n\nAlthough a longer time series is needed to solidify a decoupling conclusion, Denmark seems \nto be on track to decouple total w aste (excluding major mineral wastes) generation from \neconomic growth since 201 0. \n\n•\n\nThere may be slight decoupling between total waste (excluding major mineral wastes) \ngeneration and population growth, which grew slowly during the same period 2010 -2020 .                      \n\n1Based on data collected from Eurostat in September 2022.\n2https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.CON.PRVT.PP.KD?end=2019&locations=DK&start=2012\n650\n700\n750\n800\n850\n900\n2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\nWPP •\n\nBased on the figure , one cannot notice a clear immediate impact of Denmark’s first waste \nprevention programme (2013 - ) on total waste generation . The total waste (excluding major \nmineral wastes) generation is however lower in 2018 compared to 2010. \nFigure 2: Growth rate of waste (excluding major mineral wastes), GDP (main GDP aggregates, chain \nlinked), and population, 2010 -2020, (2010=100). \nSource: Eurostat [ENV_WASGEN, NAMA_10_PC, DEMO_GIND]        \n\n85\n90\n95\n100\n105\n110\n115\n2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020\nPopulation GDP Waste excluding major mineral wastes\n\nWASTE PREVENTION PROGRAMME \nObjectives and priorities \n\nWast e prevention objectives \n\nof the Programme \n\nquantitative objectives \n\n(waste reduction) \n\nqualitative objectives \n\n(reduction of hazardous \nsubstances/ environmental \nimpacts) \nThe Danish Government is commit ted to ensure less waste \nand better use of natural resou rces by e.g.:  \n\n•\n\nStrengthen efforts to include circular economy in EU \neco -design regulations  \n\n•\n\nIntroduce mandatory use of ecolabels in state \nprocurement  \n\n•\n\ndecreasing the level of limescale in drinking water \n(leading to, among others extended durability for \nelectronics and reduced consumption of cleaning agents)  \n\n•\n\nIntroduce mandatory use of total cost of ownership in \nstate procurement  \n\n•\n\nCreate a clear framework for municipal second -hand \nshops \n\nSectors covered  the Action Plan for Circular Economy focuses on three \n\nareas with significant environmental and climate impact:  \n\n•\n\nbiomass,  \n\n•\n\nconstruction and  \n\n•\n\nplastics \n\nPriority waste types  • biomass,  \n\n\n•\n\nconstruction and  \n\n•\n\nplastics \n\nTarget groups  The programme focuses on possible measures by public \n\ninstitutions, industry and households Targets, indicators and monitoring \n\nIndicators proposed  Denmark ’s action plan for circular economy includes a\n\nnumber of indicators of which the following addres s waste \nprevention:  \n\n•\n\nTotal waste sector CO2e emission (mil. tonnes)  \n\n•\n\nLess waste and better use of natural resources  \n\n•\n\nMunicipal waste per capita (kg)  \n\n•\n\nMaterial footprint (RMC per capita) (tonnes)  \n\n•\n\nResource productivity (BNP/RMC) (DKK per kg)  \n\n•\n\nNumber of products and services with Nordic Swan \nEcolabel  \n\n•\n\nTurnover of products and services with Nordic Swan \nEcolabel (bil lion DKK)  \n\n•\n\nCircular material use rate (recycling and mate -rial \nrecovery compared to DMC)  \n\n•\n\nClimate footprint of public procurement (mil l. tons \nCO2e ) \n\n•\n\nSignificantly reduce the amount of marine waste  \n\n•\n\nReduce the amount of food waste in all parts of the food \nvalue chain  \n\n•\n\nReduce the environmental impact from construction and \ndemolition \no Proportion of constructions certified with the \nNordic Swan Ecolabel, DGNB, LEED or \nBREEAM  \n\n•\n\nReduce consumption and improve reuse and recycling of \nplastics \no Amount of marketed plastic packaging (1000 \ntonnes) \no Amount of certain types of single -use products \n(tonnes) \no Separate collection of plastic bottles \n\nQuantitative targets  Targets are set in accordance with EU target e.g.  \n\n\n•\n\nhalving food waste generation until 2030, based on the \nSDG  \n\n•\n\nSeparate collection of plastic bottles >70 % in 2025 >90 \n% in 2029 \n\nMonitoring of programme  • waste intensity will be monitored based on annual reports \n\nby the German statistical office  \n\n•\n\nshare of reusable packaging is monitored by annual \nreports due to the German packaging law \n\nEvaluation of the programme  The implementation of the programme will be evaluated after \n\nsix years.

This transformation has occurred as a result of a dedicated and thorough policy regime that draws in key actors and assigns clear responsibilities. In the 1970s, landfilling and dumping of waste on sites lacking any kind of environmental protection was still the most common waste disposal practice in Denmark. Landfill was still so common in the 1980s that the landfill capacity was exhausted in the Copenhagen region. The generation and disposal of waste in Denmark was first mapped in 1985. This showed that 39 % of all waste and 33 % of household waste ended in landfills. The percentage of household waste landfilled was reduced to 19 % by 1995 and to 4 % by 2008, while recycling and incineration have simultaneously increased; waste is now seen as a resource to be recovered. As a consequence, many landfills receive so little waste that it is no longer economically viable to keep them fully operational (ETC/SCP, 2012, Fischer et al., 2013). The first National Waste Plan was developed in 1992, covering the period 1993–97. It included targets for recycling, incineration and landfilling of all waste (Fischer et al., 2013). Since then three plans covering the periods 1998–2004, 2005–2008 and 2009–2012 have been developed and implemented. The current plan, Denmark without Waste, Resource Plan for Waste Management 2013-2018 was adopted in 2014. The waste regulation per 1 January 2010 (Statutory order on waste 2010) changed the definition of waste regarded as MSW. All enterprises became responsible for the recycling of suitable waste under the new regulation, whereas previously, the municipalities had more authority over and duties for recyclable waste from private enterprises. In addition to household waste, fractions similar to household waste from institutions, commerce and offices had also been collected by through municipal schemes (Marcher, 2005). The change in regulation also resulted in municipalities no longer having responsibility for ensuring that sufficient recycling capacity was available either at publicly or privately owned plants for waste from institutions, commerce and offices. In order to keep 5 the coherence of the data time series, this sorted recyclable waste has been removed from municipal waste data since 1995. A new waste data system, based on the European List of Waste, was introduced in 2011 (Eurostat, 2015). Municipalities have the responsibility for introducing collection schemes to secure meeting the targets on the national level, through whichever collection scheme they choose. Practically all households in Denmark have a door-to-door collection service for residual waste. In general, 70 % of municipalities provide a source-separated collection service for paper and glass (Gibbs et al., 2014a). In addition, separate collection of further waste fractions is offered by some municipalities. In 2014, Denmark generated 4.3 million tonnes of MSW, and all generated waste was reportedly sent to treatment operations (Eurostat, 2016). 2.1 Municipal solid waste indicators The following indicators illustrate the development of Danish MSW generation and management in 2001–2014. All percentage figures have been calculated as proportions of generated waste, rather than managed waste. Figure 2.0 Denmark, municipal solid waste generation per person, 2001 – 2014 Source: Eurostat, 2016. According to Eurostat data, the generation of MSW in Denmark (Figure 2.) increased between 2001– 2008, from 606 kilograms per person to 741 kilograms, and then decreased to 673 kilogram in 2010. The considerable increase to 781 kilograms per person in MSW generation that can be seen between 2010 and 2011 may be due to the introduction of a new waste data system in 2011. In 2012-2014 MSW generation stabilized at 750–760 kilogram per person. Management of MSW in Denmark is characterised by a high degree of incineration, amounting to 54 % in 2014. It is the highest percentage and the highest amount per person in EU-28 (Eurostat, 2016). 6 2.1.1 Municipal solid waste recycling, 2001–2014 Figure 2. shows the development of recycling of MSW in Denmark related to total recycling, material recycling and composting and other biological treatment. Figure 2. illustrates a positive trend between 2001 and 2009. Total recycling increased from 31 % in 2001 to 44 % in 2009. Thereafter, the total recycling rate levelled at close to 44 %. Figure 2.1 Denmark, recycling of municipal solid waste, 2001–2014, per cent and tonnes Source: Eurostat, 2016. The increase in recycling rate is primarily linked to material recycling. The major increase in material recycling waste took place between 2007 and 2008. Most of this increase can be explained by increased generation and recycling of iron and other metals from households. There was, however, a problem with the reporting of metals from households, leading to unrealistically high amounts being recorded (ISAG Database 2012 and Miljøstyrelsen, 2011). According to the new waste data system (Table 2.1), the data for 2011–2013 show that the main waste fractions collected from households include paper, wood, packaging glass and iron and steel. Organic recycling only increased from 14 % to 17 % between 2001 and 2014, an increase from 449 000 tonnes to 743 000 tonnes. The main part of this is garden waste from households (Table 2.1). 7 Table 2.1 Denmark, main waste fractions of household waste collected, 2104, ‘000 tonnes 2011 2012 2013 Domestic and similar wastes 1 440 1 382 1 354 Waste suitable for incineration 491 469 456 Organic waste 56 54 65 Paper incl. newspapers and packaging paper 189 190 178 Packaging cardboard and other cardboard 34 38 45 Packaging glass 98 95 94 Glass 13 12 17 Packaging wood 0.4 0.4 7 Wood 76 98 117 Packaging plastic 17 15 17 Plastic 6 9 10 Packaging metal 6 6 8 Iron and steel 111 98 93 WEEE 39 40 49 Refrigerators containing freon 3 5 14 Batteries 2 1 1 Garden waste 534 551 569 Tires 4 4 4 Impregnated wood 15 13 16 PVC 1 1 1 Plaster 2 2 2 Waste suitable for landfill 72 69 50 Other wastes 63 66 106 Total 3 272.4 3218.4 3 273 Source: Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2015. The EU’s 2008 WFD includes a target for certain fractions of MSW: ‘by 2020, the preparing for re-use and the recycling of waste materials such as at least paper, metal, plastic and glass from households and possibly from other origins as far as these waste streams are similar to waste from households shall be increased to a minimum of overall 50 % by weight’. EU Member States may choose between four different methodologies to calculate compliance with the target1. Denmark has chosen calculation method 1 (Hogg et al., 2015). The recycling rates shown in this paper correspond to method 4, the only method for which time series data exist. In 2015, the European Commission has proposed new targets for municipal waste of 60 % recycling and preparing for reuse by 2025 and 65 % by 2030, based on only one calculation method, and with the option of time derogations for some countries (EC, 2015b). 1 Commission Decision 2011/753/EU allows countries to choose between four different calculation methods to report compliance with this target. Member States have the option of considering four alternative waste streams and fractions: 1. paper, metal, plastic and glass household waste; 2. paper, metal, plastic, glass household waste and other single types of household waste or of similar waste from other origins; 3. household waste; 4. municipal waste (the method used in this document). 8 2.1.2 Landfilling of biodegradable municipal waste According to the EU Landfill Directive (1999/31/EC), Member States have to reduce the amount of biodegradable municipal waste (BMW) landfilled by a specific percentage by 2006, 2009 and 2016. The targets are related to the amount of BMW generated in 1995, 1 813 000 tonnes in Denmark’s case. In 1997, Denmark implemented a landfill ban on biodegradable MSW. According to data reported to the European Commission, Denmark has not landfilled BMW for many years (EC, 2015a). Figure 2.2 Denmark, landfill of biodegradable municipal waste, 2006–2012 Source: EC, 2015a. 2.1.3 Regional differences of municipal solid waste recycling, 2001–2013 No regional data for Denmark has been reported to Eurostat. 2.1.4 Recycling and landfill taxes The Danish Landfill Tax was introduced on 1 January 1987, along with a tax on incineration. The aim was to create an incentive to reduce the amount of waste going to landfill and incineration and to promote recycling (ETC/SCP, 2012). Originally, the landfill tax included only landfills receiving waste from municipal collection schemes, but in 1989 coverage was extended to all landfills, with the exception those for hazardous waste. In 1987, the tax was DKK 40 per ton of waste (~EUR 5.3). The landfill tax was increased several times – to DKK 160 in 1993 (~EUR 21.3), DKK 335 in 1997 (~EUR 44.7), DKK 375 (~EUR 50) in 1999 and DKK 475 (~EUR 63.3) in 2010. The tax is levied on waste delivered to registered plants and a refund is granted for waste that is subsequently removed, for example, for recycling. In that way, the tax is only paid for the net amount received (ETC/SCP, 2012). The incineration tax is lower than the landfill tax. Before 2010, the incineration tax was levied per ton of waste incinerated, since 2010 it depends on the waste’s energy content (59.8 DKK/GJ), and includes also a CO2 tax (Miljøstyrelsen, 2014). 9 From 1985 to 2008, the absolute amount of household waste sent to landfill declined by 0.5 million tonnes, equivalent to a reduction of 77 %. The landfill tax has probably played a role in this reduction, together with other measures such as a ban on the landfilling of combustible waste. Figure 2.3 Denmark, landfill tax and the development of recycling, landfill and incineration of municipal solid waste, 2001–2014 Source: ETC/SCP, 2012, Eurostat, 2016, Miljøstyrelsen, 2014 The landfill tax seems to have had little impact on landfilling of MSW in the last 10 years as it was already at a low level in 2001 (Figure 2.3). Nevertheless, the landfilling rate has decreased from 7.7 % in 2001 to 1.3 % in 2014. The percentage of incineration of MSW has decreased from 61 % in 2001 to 54 % in 2014. It is likely that the incineration tax has contributed to this trend, next to the increasing policy focus on recycling. 2.1.5 Environmental benefits of better municipal solid waste management Figure 2.4 shows a scenario for greenhouse gas emissions from MSW management in Denmark. The scenario assumes a yearly growth of 0.9 % for municipal waste generation for 2011–2015 and 0.6 % for 2015–2022. The scenario also assumes that EU targets for municipal waste are fully met. The calculation of emissions is based on data and assumptions in the European Reference Model on Municipal Waste Generation and Management. The approach taken in the model is rooted in life-cycle thinking, in that it considers not only direct emissions, but also avoided emissions associated with the recycling of materials, and the generation of energy from waste management processes. The more detailed methodology is described in Gibbs et al. (2014b). The level of emissions depends on the amount of waste generated and the treatment it undergoes each year. Figure 2. shows direct emissions, avoided emissions and net emissions resulting from the management of MSW. All the emissions (positive values) represent direct operating emissions for each waste management option. The phases of the waste management chain covered include waste prevention; material recycling; composting and anaerobic digestion; mechanical biological treatment (MBT) and related technologies; collection and sorting; incineration and landfill. 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 DKK per tonne Landfill of MSW (%) Total incineration, including energy recovery (%) Total recycling (%) Material recycling (%) Composting and digestion (%) Landfill tax per tonne (DKK) 10 For avoided emissions (negative values), the calculations integrate the benefits associated with energy recovery and material recycling of paper, glass, metals, plastics, textiles and wood, and bio-treatment of food and garden waste from MSW (Gibbs et al., 2014c). Figure 2.4 Denmark, scenario for greenhouse gas emissions from municipal solid waste management in Denmark, 2011–2020 Source: ETC/WMGE, calculation based on the European Reference Model on Waste Note: Results presented in this figure should not be used for the compilation of greenhouse gas reporting for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) national inventory report, or be compared with IPCC figures, as the methodology employed here relies on life-cycle thinking and, by definition, differs substantially from the IPCC methodology. MBT means mechanical-biological treatment. In countries with a low landfill share and high recycling rate, waste treatment can have an overall positive impact on greenhouse gas emissions, reducing emissions from the economy as a whole; Denmark is one of these. Based on the modelled scenario with full policy implementation, net emissions from the treatment of municipal waste in Denmark are expected to be negative and further decrease over the period 2011–2020. Throughout the modelled period, direct greenhouse gas emissions related to municipal waste management are almost exclusively from incineration. 2.2 Uncertainties in the reporting Some uncertainties or differences in how countries report MSW recycling can result in different recycling levels. This applies, for example, to the following issues:  the extent of packaging waste from households and similar packaging from other sources included or not included in the MSW recycling reported;  the definition of municipal waste used by the country, such as the inclusion or exclusion of home composting; 11  the methodology used to report the inputs and outputs of MBT and sorting plants. Denmark does not have a producer responsibility scheme for packaging, and figures for the recycling of packaging waste are included in the municipal waste data. Until 2009, a more detailed reporting system had been used, as the general waste statistic did not deliver sufficiently good data on packaging recycling. One of the aims of the new data system for waste, introduced in 2010, was to improve the data quality for the recycling of packaging. Mechanical biological treatment plants are not used in Denmark. 2.3 Important initiatives taken to improve municipal solid waste management The major initiatives to improve MSW management in Denmark were taken before 2001. The landfill tax and incineration tax, introduced in 1987, and the total ban on the landfilling of combustible waste, agreed in 1994 and effective from 1 January 1997, have been the main drivers of the treatment of municipal waste (Fischer et al., 2013). In addition, the establishment of separate collection schemes for paper, glass packaging and garden waste has contributed significantly to the increased level of recycling. Minor initiatives were taken to improve MSW management between 2001 and 2010. The second Danish Waste Plan 1998–2004 (Waste 21) set a target of 60 % recycling for paper and cardboard waste from households and municipalities with low rates of separate collection of paper were obliged to introduce separate containers in each household for paper waste (Regeringen, 1999). The potential in tonnes was huge. The data, however, shows little change in the volume of paper collected from households between 2000 and 2009 (Miljøstyrelsen, 2011). During the last decade the recycling centres for household waste run by the municipalities have been expanded and more waste types can be delivered to the recycling centres. The third Danish Waste Plan 2005–2008 implemented the targets in the EU Directive for packaging and packaging waste that had to be fulfilled in 2008. Some initiatives focused on municipal waste. The municipalities had to implement collection schemes for metal packaging and certain types of plastic packaging (Regeringen, 2003). The introduction of a deposit system for single-use beverage packaging in 2002 increased the amount of separately collected plastic and metal packaging waste and the amount of recycling. However, the potential in tonnes for these schemes were quite small and it did not influence the total recycling of municipal waste. The fourth Danish Waste Plan 2009–2012 did not focus on new initiatives for the recycling of municipal waste other than setting a target for the collection of batteries (Regeringen, 2009). The most recent initiatives were introduced in the National Waste Management Plan (NWMP) for 201–2018, released in 2014 (Miljøstyrelsen, 2014). The initiatives presented in it are focused on meeting the recycling targets for household waste. The Danish national target is that 50 % of organic, including wood, paper, cardboard, glass, plastic, and metal waste from households is collected for recycling or material recovery by 2022, and the strategy for achieving this is based on ensuring the development of new separate collection schemes in municipalities. This will allow citizens better access to sorting and secure an increase in the recycling of waste, including organic, plastic and metal fractions. In addition, establishing partnerships between different actors, including municipalities, companies, designers and anthropologists, could help the development of simple and easily accessible waste systems (BiPRO and CRI, 2015). In 2013, Denmark also adopted the Denmark without Waste (Danmark uden affald) strategy and a number of follow-up projects have been started or finalised (Miljøstyrelsen, 2016). 12 Figure 2.5 Denmark, recycling of municipal solid waste in Denmark and important policy initiatives, 2001–2014 Source: Eurostat, 2016.– 2.4 Possible future trends According to the data presented in Figure 2., the recycling rate has increased very slowly since 2009. The 2013 Denmark without Waste strategy (Regeringen, 2013) and the NWMP 2013–2018 (Miljøstyrelsen, 2014) aim to increase the share of recycling, particularly through increased separate collection. These initiatives have only just started and it remains to be seen how effective they will be. 13 References BiPRO and CRI, 2015, National factsheet on separate collection – Denmark, prepared within the EC study Assessment of separate collection schemes in the 28 capitals of the EU.
