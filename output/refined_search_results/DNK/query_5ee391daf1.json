It builds to a large extent on the answers provided by the Danish Environmental Protection Agency in April 2021 to a questionnaire developed by the EEA and ETC/WMGE. The EEA and ETC/CE would like to thank the Danish authorities for the provided information and for the kind review of drafts of this assessment report in 2021 and April 2022. 1 Introduction 1.1 Background and purpose The Waste Framework Directive 2008/98/EC (as amended by Directive (EU) 2018/851) includes a target to recycle and prepare for reuse, by 2025, 55 % of municipal waste generated. The Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive (94/62/EC as amended by Directive (EU) 2018/852) includes targets for the recycling of packaging waste, both in total and by material, to be achieved by 2025. The Landfill Directive (1999/31/EC as amended by Directive (EU) 2018/850) requires to limit the landfilling of municipal waste to 10 % of the generated municipal waste by 2035. The Directives also foresee that the European Commission, in cooperation with the European Environment Agency, publishes early warning reports on the Member States’ progress towards the attainment of the targets, including a list of Member States at risk of not attaining the targets within the respective deadlines, three years ahead of the target dates. This assessment is a contribution from the EEA to the early warning reports according to Article 11b Waste Framework Directive and Art. 6b Packaging and Packaging Waste directive. This document is an early warning assessment for Denmark. The document is based on the analysis of a number of factors affecting recycling performance (success and risk factors). The assessment aims at concluding whether Denmark is at risk of missing the targets for municipal waste and packaging waste set in EU legislation for 2025. In addition, it provides a preliminary assessment of the prospects for meeting the 2035 target for landfilling of municipal waste. The assessment takes into account information that was available before 10 May 2022. 1.2 Approach The assessment follows a methodology developed by the EEA and ETC/WMGE and consulted with the Eionet in 2020 (ETC/WMGE, 2021), which was adjusted in 2021 taking into account experiences with applying the methodology in 2021 (ETC/CE & ETC/WMGE, 2022). This methodology uses a set of quantitative and qualitative success and risk factors that have been identified to affect the recycling performance. The assessment is to a large extent based on the information provided by the Member State in the reply to an EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire as well as on available data and information from Eurostat and other relevant sources. In addition, a consortium under contract with the European Commission (led by Rambøll Group) has conducted a critical review of the draft assessment in Q4/2021 and provided further information. More specifically, chapter 2.1 assesses the likelihood for Denmark to achieve the target to prepare for reuse and recycle at least 55 % of municipal solid waste (MSW) for 2025. Chapter 2.2 assesses the likelihood for Denmark to achieve the overall packaging waste and specific packaging materials’ recycling targets for 2025. Chapter 2.3 examines the prospects for Denmark to landfill less than 10 % of the generated municipal solid waste by 2035. The official early warning assessment for the landfilling target is only due in 2032 and accordingly, the assessment contained in Chapter 2.3 is only preliminary. 1.3 Member State profile – context parameters Municipal waste generation and treatment The annual municipal waste generation and treatment has remained rather stable in Denmark between 2016 and 2020. The municipal waste generation was around 5 million tonnes in 2020. Waste generation per capita is very high, with 845 kg/cap in 2020, which is significantly higher than the (estimated) EU average of 505 kg/cap in 2020. The country has a quite even division between waste collected for recycling and waste incineration, being 53.9 % and 45.2 % respectively in 2020. Less than 1 % is being landfilled. Waste collected for material recycling increased between 2016 and 2020 from 29.9 % to 35.5 %, while composting and digestion stagnated around 18.4 %. The recycling rate (collected for material recycling and composting and digestion) has increased from 48.3 % in 2016 to 53.9 % in 2020 (Eurostat, 2022a). Denmark has a very high incineration capacity, roughly double the amount of residual municipal waste sent to incineration in 2019. On 16 June 2020, the Danish Government and Parties representing a broad majority in the Danish Parliament agreed on a Climate plan for a green waste sector and a circular economy. The climate plan includes initiatives – amongst others – towards reducing waste and reducing the capacity for waste incineration. In order to adjust the capacity, a tender-based model is foreseen and the waste incineration plants will have to compete for the waste. Environmental requirements for the incineration plants will be tightened so that plants that lag behind environmentally either invest in technological improvements or close. Figure 1.1 Municipal waste generation and treatment in Denmark between 2016 and 2020, in thousand tonnes Notes: Provisional data for 2020 Source: Eurostat (2022a) Legal Framework The main national regulations in the area of waste are the Environmental Protection Act (Miljø- og Fødevareministeriet, 2022) and the Statutory Order on Waste (Miljøministeriet, 2020b), defining principles, responsibilities and requirements on waste prevention and management in Denmark. The Statutory Order on waste regulations, fees and actors (Klima-, Energi- og Forsyningsministeriet, 2020) covers the treatment of waste that is not regulated by other legislation, the municipalities’ regulations on waste, schemes for waste, fees for waste, assignment of waste benchmarking of waste incineration plants. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency has issued guidelines for the sorting and collection of municipal waste from households (Miljøministeriet, 2020c, 2020d). Waste management plan(s) Denmark’s National Waste Management Plan (NWMP) Action plan for circular economy - National plan for prevention and management of waste 2020-2032 (Handlingsplan for cirkulær økonomi - National plan for forebyggelse og håndtering af affald 2020-2032) was adopted by the Danish Ministry of Environment (Miljøministeriet) in 2021 (Miljøministeriet, 2021a). The plan was drawn up largely based on previous strategies, agreements, plans and revised ordinances and can thus be seen as a consolidation of these. It will be reviewed at the latest after six years from its adoption. The NWMP covers all types of waste generated in Denmark also including commercial waste, sewage sludge, soil waste. The only exception is nuclear/radioactive waste. The NWMP covers the entire territory and is supplemented by municipal WMPs. According to the NWMP sorting and collection of household waste must be streamlined for ten types of household waste (food, paper, cardboard, metal, glass, plastic, textile and hazardous waste as well as food and beverage cartons and residual waste). These waste streams must be collected from households and common national sorting criteria for household waste must be used to create a basis for increased recycling with higher quality. The NWMP states that the Danish government expects to meet the 2025 and 2030 packaging waste recycling targets by implementing all measures included in the plan, with the exception of plastic. To increase plastics recycling, Denmark is launching a number of initiatives such as the ban of the marketing of certain disposable plastic products; a requirement to use 25 % recycled plastic in plastic bottles in 2025 and 30 % in 2030; a requirement of a minimum of 60 % real recycling of collected plastic waste from households by 2022 (Miljøministeriet, 2020b). Packaging waste generation and treatment In Denmark, 983 000 tonnes (169kg/cap) of packaging waste were generated in 2019, which is slightly below the EU average of 178 kg/cap. Packaging waste generation has been increasing, especially plastics packaging (Figure 1.2). Paper and cardboard packaging waste generation fluctuates at the level of approximately 67 kg/cap since 2010 (Eurostat, 2022b). Figure 1.2 Packaging waste generation in Denmark between 2010 and 2019, in kg per capita Note: Data for 2010 are estimated values for all packaging waste, and in 2011 there is a break in time series for metallic and glass packaging. Values for 2011 and 2012 are flagged as estimates for metallic and glass packaging. Source: Eurostat (2022b) Capture rates for recyclables The capture rate is a good performance indicator of the effectiveness of the separate collection system. The capture rate has been calculated for this report by dividing the separately collected weight of a certain municipal waste material by the estimated weight of the total amount of material in the municipal waste. The Danish EPA has provided calculations for the residual waste composition for municipal waste. Due to an expected difference in composition for recycling stations and households/non-households residual waste, amounts of materials present in the residual waste from these two sources were calculated separately. For Denmark the separate collection capture rates are presented in Table 1.1. Table 1.1 Capture rates for different waste fractions in Denmark Residual waste compo-sition (%)(a) Residual waste composition (tonnes)(b) Residual waste composition for recycling stations (%)(c) Residual waste composition for recycling stations (tonnes)(d) Separately collected amounts (tonnes) (e) Materials in total MSW (tonnes) Capture rates (%) Mixed municipal waste, total 1 858 138 136 709 Paper and cardboard 18 343 220 18 25 252 555 614 924 086 60 Metals 2 36 341 2 2 674 166 562 205 577 81 Glass 2 28 265 2 2 080 148 420 178 765 83 Plastic 10 193 298 10 14 222 75 331 282 851 27 Garden waste 1 13 612 1 1 367 948 750 963 730 98 Food waste 44 820 921 1 1 367 115 188 937 476 12 Textiles 2 40 379 5 6 835 1 203 48 418 2 Wood n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a Source: Miljøministeriet (2022) Notes: (a) Analysis of household residual waste and source-separated organic waste, 2018, the Danish EPA (Miljø- og Fødevareministeriet, 2017). The composition is calculated based on data from the report. (b) The composition of household and non-household municipal residual waste is assumed to be the same. The amount of mixed municipal waste is from Affaldsstatistik 2019 (Miljø- og Fødevareministeriet, 2020), excl. the amount from recycling stations. (c) For residual waste from recycling stations, the same composition from household residual waste was applied except for the share of food and textile waste. The composition is an estimate. (d) Provided by the Danish EPA (e) As reported in Affaldsstatistik 2019, Miljø- og Fødevareministeriet (2020) This indicates that there is some room for improvement to capture higher amounts of the generated food waste, plastics and textiles and to some extent also of paper and cardboard. Since 2017 more municipalities have increased the number of separately collected material which is expected to affect the composition of municipal residual waste, especially for food waste (Miljøministeriet, 2022). While a capture rate for WEEE can be calculated with the same method, it delivers unreliable outcomes as there are considerable invisible flows (Miljøministeriet, 2021b) that are not captured in the data. 2 Success and risk factors likely to influence future performance 2.1 Target for preparing for reuse and recycling of municipal waste This chapter aims at assessing the prospects of Denmark to achieve the 55 % preparing for reuse and recycling target for municipal waste in 2025. For a detailed description of the methodology followed, the development of success/risk factors and their impact on recycling, please consult the methodology report (ETC/CE & ETC/WMGE, 2022). 2.1.1 Current situation and past trends SRF MSWR-1.1: Distance to target The overall recycling rate of Denmark shows a steady increase mainly driven by increasing material recycling (Figure 2.1). In this analysis the recycling rate is calculated by dividing the summed amounts of recycling of materials and of composting and digestion by the total generated amounts. The data source used is the Eurostat data set Municipal waste by waste management operations [env_wasmun] (following the OECD/Eurostat Joint Questionnaire); Data reported by Member States according to Article 10.2(a) of the Waste Framework Directive are not used for this assessment as the reporting methods differ by Member State, resulting in a lack of comparability between Member States. The data source used here is assumed to be the best available proxy, given that data in accordance with the rules on the calculation of the attainment of the targets as defined in Article 11a are not yet available. Figure 2.1 Recycling rate in Denmark between 2016 and 2020, in percentage Source: Eurostat (2022a) The actual distance to the target for the most recent data point is a key factor determining the likelihood of meeting/not meeting the target. The closer the Member State is to the target already, the more likely it becomes that the target will be met. For Denmark, the rate of municipal waste collected for recycling is 53.9 % in 2020, which is close to the 55 % target for 2025 (Miljø- og Fødevareministeriet, 2020). However, the data used for this analysis is based on a different methodology than the calculation rules for the target. The Danish government has provisionally estimated the impact of the application of the new calculation rules on the recycling rates by accounting for average loss rates per waste type. The expected impact on the recycling rate for municipal waste is that the recycling rate would drop from 52 % to 44 % for 2019 (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2020). The same 8 percentage point decrease is applied to the latest available data (2020) in this assessment to calculate the actual distance to the target. The Danish government is working on a more precise way of calculating the recycling rate according to the new rules (Miljøministeriet, 2022). Summary result Distance to target 5 - 15 percentage points Based on the currently available data, Denmark’s recycling rate was 53.9 % in 2020, 1.1 percentage points below the 2025 target. Considering however, the application of the new calculation rules, an estimated decrease of the recycling rate by 8 percentage points is assumed, leading to an approximate recycling rate of 45.9 % or 9.1 percentage points below the target. Robustness of the underlying information The new calculation rules are likely to lead to lower calculated recycling levels. Based on calculations done by the Danish authorities, the recycling rate would drop by 8 percentage points. SRF MSWR-1.2: Past trend in municipal solid waste recycling rate The recycling rate over the last five years shows a steady increase of 5.6 percentage points from 2016 to 2020, mainly driven by increasing material recycling (Figure 2.1). This indicates that efforts have to be intensified compared to progress of the past few years. Summary result RR > 45%, and increase in last 5 years < 10 percentage points The recycling rate has increased with 5.6 percentage points. For Denmark the application of the new calculation rules would result in an estimated recycling rate of 45.9 %, based on estimates done by the Danish Environmental Protection Agency that the recycling rate would decrease by 8 percentage points. The pace of improvement needs to be speeded up to obtain the target. Robustness of the underlying information There are no breaks in the time series data. For 2019 the Danish Environmental Protection Agency estimated that the recycling rate would drop by 8 percentage points if the new calculation rules would be applied, this same rate is used for 2020 in this assessment. 2.1.2 Legal instruments SRF MSWR-2.1: Timely transposition of the revised Waste Framework Directive into national law Timely transposition of the Waste Framework Directive as amended by Directive 2018/851, into national law within the foreseen period is key for a waste management system in line with EU requirements. Denmark has transposed the amended Waste Framework Directive in its Act No 807 of 9 June 2020 and Act No 645 of 19 May 2020 amending the Environmental Protection Act. Furthermore, the requirements for separate collection and waste management are transposed in Order No 2159 of 9 December 2020, which has since been repealed and replaced by Order No 2512 of 10 December 2021. Summary result Transposition without delay Denmark has transposed the amended WFD into national law by the transposition deadline. Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the European Commission (status as of 12 November 2021). SRF MSWR-2.2: Responsibilities for meeting the targets, and support and enforcement mechanisms, e.g. tools, fines etc. Clearly defined responsibilities, enforcement and support mechanisms for meeting the targets across different entities and governance levels are important for achieving high recycling rates. The clearer the responsibilities for meeting the targets and the accountability for failing the targets are, the higher the chance that the targets will be met. The Ministry of Environment is responsible for preparing the national legislation related to waste management, including setting targets for preparation for re-use, recycling, or material recovery of municipal waste, as well as stating minimum requirements for the management of waste. The Danish Climate action plan for a green waste sector and a circular economy was adopted in June 2020, which agreed to streamline the collection of municipal waste, as well as changing the framework for the waste sector so that it supports less waste incineration and more recycling. Further, it was agreed in the same Plan to reduce the incineration capacity. Capacity must be reduced and adapted to the Danish waste volumes so that the available capacity is not filled up with imported waste. In order to address plastic waste, the Plan foresees setting up a system for collecting plastic waste in the public space by January 2025 at the latest, as part of the extended producer responsibility for packaging to be introduced in Denmark. The municipalities are responsible for collecting household waste and packaging waste as a part of household waste and have to ensure proper municipal waste management. It is defined in the Danish legislation, which types of waste the municipalities are obliged to collect separately and how the municipalities are to ensure proper waste management. The municipalities have to define minimum requirements for the collection of different waste fractions (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; Miljø- og Fødevareministeriet, 2019; Miljøministeriet, 2020b). The municipalities are required to separately collect ten different types of waste using high convenience collection systems (door-to-door or, for apartment blocks, in short walking distance): food, paper, cardboard, metal, glass, plastic, textile waste as well as beverage and food cartons, residual waste and hazardous waste. This requirement is implemented in national legislation and applies from 1 July 2021. However, a majority of municipalities have been granted an extension of the deadline until end of 2022 (Miljøministeriet, 2021a); for textile waste the deadline still has to be decided but will lie between 1 July 2023 and 1 January 2025. If the municipalities offer bulky waste schemes they are also required to sort the waste after collection in order to achieve a high recycling and reuse rate. Commercial producers of waste, including of municipal waste similar to household waste, are obliged to sort their waste at source into recyclable fractions, and to make sure that the recyclable fractions are used for material recovery (Miljøministeriet, 2020b). Municipalities can decide to organise collection of residual waste from commercial waste producers or oblige them to deliver the waste to certain waste facilities (Energistyrelsen, 2021). Municipalities are obliged to control the correct management of commercial waste via inspections (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021). Measures to achieve the targets are defined in the Circular Economy Action Plan – National plan for prevention and management of waste (Handlingsplan for cirkulær økonomi – National plan for forebyggelse og håndtering af affald 2020-2032). In addition, the municipalities are required by 1 January 2022 to set requirements for minimum 60 % recycling of the collected household plastic waste in their contracts with the waste collectors. The municipalities must furthermore ensure a high recycling rate of all separately collected recyclable types of waste, however, national legislation does not set quantitative targets for recycling for the municipalities to meet. The Danish deposit and return system (DRS) for beverage packaging is responsible for collection and recycling of disposable beverage packaging, not for the handling of refillable bottles. The DRS is regulated in the Order on Deposits (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; Miljøministeriet, 2020a). The Danish EPA supports the implementation of proper waste management in Denmark via communication and cooperation with municipalities. The EPA has published guidelines for waste management, aiming to streamline and improve waste collection and ensure increasing capture rates of recyclables in Denmark for both municipal waste and packaging waste (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021). Related to enforcement mechanisms, the National Board of Appeal is the supervising authority for the municipalities, supervising the compliance with national law. In the case of non-compliance, the Board can assign daily fines to the members of the municipal council as enforcement mechanism. (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021) Summary result Clearly defined responsibilities, enforcement and good set of support mechanisms for meeting the recycling targets Denmark reports clearly defined responsibilities, as well as clearly defined enforcement mechanisms for meeting the targets on recycling of municipal waste, in addition Denmark also presents support mechanisms to improve the implementation of the responsible entities. Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the Danish authorities through the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire 2.1.3 Economic instruments SRF MSW-3.1: Taxes and/or ban for landfilling residual- or biodegradable waste Bans and taxes on landfilling of residual municipal waste can help to discourage strong reliance on residual waste treatment and thus support recycling. Denmark has a landfill tax in place since 1987 of 475 DKK/t (about 63.3 EUR/t) before VAT (about 79 EUR/t VAT incl.). Since 1997, there is also a landfill ban on recyclable and combustible waste (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; Skatteministeriet, 2020). Summary result Ban in place for landfilling residual or biodegradable waste Denmark has a landfill ban, and a landfill tax of 79 EUR/t (corresponding to 56 EUR/t rescaled based on purchasing power parities(a)) Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the Danish authorities through the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire. (a) Note: Rescaled based on purchasing power parities Eurostat (2020a) SRF MSWR-3.2: Taxes on municipal waste incineration Taxes on incineration of residual municipal waste can help to discourage strong reliance on residual waste treatment and thus support recycling. Denmark has taxes on waste incineration via three different elements (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; SKAT (Danish Tax Authority), 2022; Miljøministeriet, 2022): • An incineration tax since 1999 that totals 52.5 DKK/GJ in 2022, consisting of: o A tax on heat generated from waste incineration (20.7 DKK/GJ), which is indexed annually with the net price index o An additional incineration tax (31.8 DKK/GJ), which is not indexed. • A CO2-tax since 2010 which is levied on incinerated non-biodegradable waste (179.2 DKK/tonne of CO2 emitted), which is indexed annually with the net price index. Due to the different tax bases for the three taxation elements, the taxes cannot easily be translated into a tax per tonne of waste. If an energy content of 10.6 GJ/tonne is assumed (Danish Ministry of the Environment, 2013), the incineration tax alone would be around 557 DKK/tonne, corresponding to 75 EUR/t. Summary result Taxes > 18 EUR/t(a) If an energy content of 10.6 GJ/tonne is assumed, the incineration tax alone would be about 75 EUR/t (corresponding to 53 EUR/t rescaled based on purchasing power parities). Furthermore, a CO2-tax is levied on incinerated non-biodegradable waste. Robustness of the underlying information The underlying information provided by the Danish authorities can be considered robust. The calculation of the total incineration tax rate is based on assumptions. (a) Note: Rescaled based on purchasing power parities Eurostat (2020a) SRF MSWR-3.3: Pay-as-you-throw (PAYT) system in place PAYT systems are designed to incentivize citizens to make a bigger effort in separating their waste at source. However, a PAYT system should be designed with the appropriate level of source separation encouragement to ensure that citizens do not misplace waste in recycling bins in order to avoid residual waste charges. Overall, PAYT usually has a positive effect on source separation and thus recycling rates through direct involvement of citizens. Denmark has a policy of full cost recovery for municipal waste collection which allows for the possibility of PAYT-schemes. As a principle, the fees for municipal waste management shall cover all costs related to the service. It is not allowed to cover cost for the service of collecting recyclables through the residual waste fee. The legal framework permits the use of PAYT by municipalities. Municipalities still often charge a flat rate for collection of both recyclables and residual waste, with some municipalities granting citizens a choice of the size of container, the larger container having a higher fee (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; Klima-, Energi- og Forsyningsministeriet, 2020). Recent information about the shares of the different systems is not available. A survey of Danish municipalities performed in 2015 indicated that container volume based fees and fees based on a combination of factors were dominant while there was very little use of weight based systems (Deloitte and Incentive, 2015). Summary result PAYT scheme implemented in some regions/ municipalities (50-80% of population covered) Denmark has a policy for municipal waste collection which allows for the possibility of PAYT-schemes but municipalities often do not implement PAYT. Robustness of the underlying information It is unclear how strong the economic incentive is for citizens to place waste in the bins for recyclables instead of in the bin for residual waste. Recent information about the shares of the different systems (volume based, frequency of collection, weight based) is not available. 2.1.4 Separate collection system SRF MSWR-4.1: Convenience and coverage of separate collection systems for the different household waste fractions Separate collection systems are a key enabler for high recycling rates and for collecting recyclables at adequate quality. Generally, the more convenient and accessible these systems are for their users, the better results they deliver. The assessment methodology categorises different types of collection systems (door-to-door, bring points with a density of > 5 per km2, bring points with a density of < 5 per km2, civic amenity site) for assessing the degree of convenience, and differentiates between cities (densely populated), towns and suburbs (intermediate densely populated) and rural (thinly populated areas). It then calculates which share of the population is served by which type of system. The assessment is done on a material basis and takes into account the different materials according to their average share in municipal waste. This is described in more detail in the methodology (ETC/CE & ETC/WMGE, 2022) For Denmark, according to the most recent data, the percentage of households living in cities is 32 %, in towns and suburbs 35 % and in rural areas 33 % (Eurostat, 2021a). In Denmark, there have been a large number of different waste sorting and collection schemes across the municipalities, resulting in a high variance in the collection schemes between municipalities. This changed in July 2021 with the implementation of the Climate action plan for a green waste sector and a circular economy (see next section), however, the majority of Danish municipalities have been granted an extension of the deadline to fully implement the new requirements until end of 2022. The use of co-mingled collection has been increasing (Eurostat, 2020b). The separate collection of food waste is today not covered by all municipalities (56 %) (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021). The municipalities are required to separately collect ten different types of waste through high convenience collection systems: food, paper, cardboard, metal, glass, plastic, textile waste as well as beverage and food cartons, residual waste and hazardous waste. The collection should be door-to-door if possible, with respect to the types of buildings/housing area. Depending on the type of areas a bring point can be used, that is located so it can be reached by foot. Thus, the type of schemes used will change over the next two years – since the deadline has been postponed for a number of municipalities. Both households and companies are obliged to sort their waste for separate collection. Municipalities can decide if companies can use the collection system organised by the municipality or if they should organise collection themselves or through contractors. However, municipalities are responsible for the inspection of commercial waste management (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; Miljøministeriet, 2020c). Table 2.1 gives an overview of the collection system in Denmark. The collection in Demark is material based and the collection systems do not distinguish between packaging and non-packaging waste. The Danish EPA publishes data about municipalities’ implementation of the requirements to collect ten different fractions separately (Miljøministeriet, 2021c). Table 2.1 Characterisation of the collection system in Denmark Cities (densely populated areas) Towns and suburbs (intermediate density areas) Rural areas (thinly populated areas) Door-to-door - separate Door-to-door - co-mingled Bring point (>5 per km²) Bring point (<5 per km²) Civic amenity site Door-to-door - separate Door-to-door - co-mingled Bring point (>5 per km²) Bring point (<5 per km²) Civic amenity site Door-to-door - separate Door-to-door - co-mingled Bring point Civic amenity site Residual waste xx x xx x xx x Paper and Cardboard xx x xx x x xx x xx x x xx x xx x Ferrous metals x x x x x x x x x x x Aluminium x x x x x x x x x x x Glass x x x x x x x X x x x x x x Plastic x x x x x x x x x x x Bio-waste food x x x x x x garden x x x x x x x x Textiles x (few) x x x x (few) x x x x (few) x x Wood x x x x x x x x x WEEE x x x x x x x x Composite packaging x(a) (few) x(a) (few) X(a) (few) Other: Hazardous waste x x (with WEEE) x x x x x (with WEEE) x x x x x (with WEEE) x x Note: xx: dominant system; x: other significant systems. Grey cells indicate high convenience collection systems. (a) Primo 2022, about 1.25 million people (23 % of the population) covered by separate collection of food and drink cartons Source: Danish Environmental Protection Agency (2021), Miljøministeriet (2021c) Taking this into account, Denmark uses a range of options for separate collection, with different services offered in different municipalities. Summary result Paper and cardboard A high share of the population is covered by high convenience collection services For paper and cardboard waste, different types of separate collection systems are used by the Danish municipalities but door-to-door separate collection and high-density bring points dominate. Metals A high share of the population is covered by high convenience collection services For metals waste, a large range of different types of separate collection systems are used by the Danish municipalities, except low-density bring points in urban areas and civic amenity sites in rural areas. Plastics A high share of the population is covered by high convenience collection services For plastic waste, a large range of different types of separate collection systems are used by the Danish municipalities, except low-density bring points in urban areas and civic amenity sites in rural areas. Glass A high share of the population is covered by high convenience collection services Denmark conducts all separate collection alternatives for the collection of glass waste. More than 70 % of the municipalities collect glass waste either by door-to-door collection or high-convenience bring points. Bio-waste A medium share of the population is covered by high convenience collection services Denmark conducts door-to-door and high density bring point collection for food and garden waste, but not yet in all municipalities. Garden waste is additionally collected at civic amenity sites. Improvements are expected by the end of 2022. Wood A high share of the population is covered by high convenience collection services Denmark conducts door-to-door and high density bring point collection for wood waste. This collection mainly refers to picking up bulky waste from households. Wood waste is additionally collected at civic amenity sites. Textiles A low share of the population is covered by high convenience collection services Denmark conducts bring point and civic amenity site collection with a small addition of co-mingled collection for textile waste. Reusable textiles are also collected by charities. WEEE High to medium convenience collection services dominate Denmark conducts door-to-door and high-density bring point collection for WEEE and additionally civic amenity site collection in urban areas. Many municipalities have introduced collection schemes for battery waste and small electronic waste, e.g. so that it is collected together with hazardous waste. Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the Danish authorities through the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire. Danish municipalities apply different types of separate collection systems for the different materials. However, no quantitative information is available for the coverage of each system. This means that the population coverages in this table are rough estimates. SRF MSWR-4.2: Firm plans to improve the convenience and coverage of separate collection for the different household waste fractions In the waste Law it is stated , that as of July 2021, with the option to apply for a derogation until 31 December 2022, all municipalities are obliged to arrange high convenience separate collection schemes for the following waste fractions (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; Miljøministeriet, 2020b): residual waste, paper, cardboard, metal, glass, plastic, food waste, textiles (between mid-2023 and 1 January 2025), composite packaging (food- and drink cartons) and hazardous waste. The municipalities can choose between door-to-door-separate collection or door-to-door-co-mingled collection (for certain combinations of materials). For glass as well as for all fractions in densely populated areas and from holiday cottages a bring point system in walking distance from the house is accepted. For the following fractions co-mingled collection will be allowed (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; Miljøministeriet, 2020d): paper/cardboard, metal/plastic, plastic/ composite packaging, metal/plastic/composite packaging and metal/glass. Today, reusable textiles are collected via charity organisations. The separate collection scheme for textile waste will be limited to textiles waste not suitable for reuse (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021). Together with the national harmonisation of the separate collection system, a harmonised pictogram and colour scheme is rolled out in order to improve the citizen’s understanding of the waste collection system across the country. It has been developed by the Danish Environmental Protection Agency, the Association of municipalities and the Danish Waste Association and is used or underway to be used by nearly all Danish municipalities (Danish Waste Association, 2021). As of 2023, non-household waste generators are obliged to sort their waste for separate collection similar to household waste for the same fractions as households with the same options regarding co-mingled fractions (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; Miljøministeriet, 2020c). It is important to note that non-household waste generators already are obliged to sort their waste and ensure proper waste management. But from 2023 they are obliged to sort municipal waste in the same way and use the same pictograms on the collection containers as municipalities shall for collection containers for household waste. Non-household waste generators are allowed to sort in more detailed fractions if it is suitable with regard to the specific waste generated. Summary result Paper and cardboard Firm plans to improve the separate collection system, with clear responsible entities and defined targets and timeline. As of July 2021, but with the option to apply for a derogation until end 2022, all municipalities in Denmark are obliged to arrange separate collection schemes (door-to-door or high convenience bring points) Metals Firm plans to improve the separate collection system, with clear responsible entities and defined targets and timeline.

Textiles Firm plans to improve the separate collection system, with clear responsible entities and defined targets and timeline. Between 2023 and 2025, it will be required that all municipalities in Denmark are obliged to arrange separate collection schemes (door-to-door or high convenience bring points) WEEE N/A (for countries already covering > 80% of the population by high convenience collection services) No changes planned. Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the Danish authorities through the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire. The obligations for municipalities are set in the Danish legislation and explained in recommendations issued by the Danish EPA. 2.1.5 Extended producer responsibility (EPR) and similar schemes SRF MSWR-5.1: Fee modulation in EPR schemes for packaging Within EPR schemes, fee modulation (or eco-modulation) is a system with different fees for different types of packaging material and designs. While basic fee modulation, i.e. different fees for the main material groups, are common, advanced fee modulation can create stronger incentives for packaging producers to design for recycling and thus create favourable conditions for higher recycling rates. The level of advancement of the fee modulation is assessed against four criteria that have been selected as benchmarks for a well-designed eco-modulated fee system: • recyclability, for example differentiating between PET and PS, between different colours of PET, or between 100 % cardboard boxes and laminated beverage cartons; • sortability and disruptors, for example a malus for labels/caps/sleeves made of other materials, which are not fitted for the recycling technologies of the main packaging; • recycled content; and • if there is a transparent compliance check by the Producer Responsibility Organisation (PRO) that producers report correctly. Denmark has no general EPR scheme for packaging yet, instead Denmark has a comprehensive deposit return system for beverage packaging, also aiming at preventing free riding in relation to beverage packaging. The deposit return system is planned to continue and to operate in parallel with a new general EPR scheme for all other packaging, which is not covered by the deposit return system. The implementation process for setting up a general EPR scheme has started. A law that establishes the legal basis for a general EPR system for packaging in Denmark was passed by the Danish Government in June 2020. In March 2022, the organisation and administrative setup for the EPR system is still under discussion with political parties (Miljøministeriet, 2022). The EPR scheme for packaging will be introduced no later than 31 December 2024 and will include all types of packaging in all types of materials. While no EPR system and thus no fee modulation within EPR is currently in place for packaging, the Danish deposit return system (Dansk Retursystem) requires producers and importers of bottled and canned beverages to pay a quarterly fee for marketing beverages on which deposits are payable. The fees vary for each type of bottle or can, depending on the volume of the bottle or can and their recyclability. The fees are calculated each year based on the expenditure of Dansk Retursystem versus the income. The fees are required to solely reflect the exact costs of operating and administering an efficient deposit and return system (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021). Summary result No EPR scheme and no advanced fee modulation Denmark has no EPR scheme for packaging yet. Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the Danish authorities through the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire. 2.1.6 Treatment capacity for bio-waste SRF MSWR-6.1: Capacity for the treatment of bio-waste Bio-waste is the largest single waste material fraction in municipal waste, and adequate treatment capacity needs to be made available. As reported by the Danish authorities, the country’s separately collected bio-waste amounted to 1 336 000 tonnes in 2019, comprising of 353 000 tonnes of food waste collected from households, restaurants, catering, retail and food industry, and 983 000 tonnes of garden waste. 93 % of garden waste from households was collected for recycling (Miljø- og Fødevareministeriet, 2020). In 2019 882 000 tonnes municipal waste was collected for composting and digestion (Eurostat, 2021b). The Danish authorities estimate, based on current knowledge, that 75 % of garden waste collected for recycling undergoes recycling treatment, if accounting for average loss rates per waste type according to the new calculation rules. For food waste the estimate is 85 %. The Danish authorities do not report a specific available capacity for the treatment of bio-waste. The total generation of bio-waste within total municipal waste, including separately collected bio-waste and bio-waste present in the residual waste fraction, is estimated at 1 901 206 tonnes in 2017 (this is the sum of food waste and garden waste) (Table 1.1). As of July 2021 and by end of 2022 at the latest, all households should have collection of food waste, and from 31 December 2023 the municipalities are required to establish a separate collection scheme for garden waste from households. Bio-waste treatment will be privately organised and municipalities must tender the treatment of bio-waste. Municipalities unable to cover the capacity demand from the private sector may be granted exemption from the legal requirement to tender the treatment of bio-waste and allowed to arrange for treatment capacity themselves (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; Government of Denmark, 2020). Based on a survey of treatment installations and a calculation on the potential of food waste in Denmark, the Waste and Resource Network Denmark (DAKOFA, 2021) estimates that the current capacity for anaerobic digestion of food waste covers 72-87 % of the food waste potential (related to both food waste from households and the service sector). Based on the presented information, it is likely that the currently available capacity for the treatment of bio-waste is slightly below 80 % of the generated bio-waste, however, the municipalities have a clear mandate to either tender or create the additional capacity needed to close any capacity gap. Summary result Bio-waste capacity below 80% of generated municipal bio-waste but firm plans to close the gap The Danish authorities report that the required additional capacity demand for the treatment of bio-waste will be covered by the private sector or the municipalities. Robustness of the underlying information The information regarding available capacities is limited, and information is lacking on how the future capacity building will be implemented in practice. SRF MSWR-6.2: Legally binding national standards and Quality Management System for compost/digestate To create a market for compost and digestate, compost should be of a good quality for use as a soil improver or fertilizer. Legally binding standards provide guarantees regarding the quality of the compost/digestate produced. A quality management system aims at addressing different elements of a production process to ensure a stable and high-quality output (product) which helps toward reaching a defined quality for the product. Denmark has national standards for compost quality (EEA, 2020; Miljø- og Fødevareministeriet, 2018, 2008). Before the composting and/or biogas process, the bio-waste needs to comply with the limit values laid down in statutory order no. 1001 of the 27 June 2018 regarding the use of waste for agricultural purposes (Miljøministeriet, 2022). The Danish Agricultural Agency is in the process of implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1009 of the 5 June 2019 regarding laying down rules on the making available on the market of EU fertilising products. This regulation includes quality management systems and standards for compost quality (Miljøministeriet, 2022). Summary result Legally binding national standards for compost/digestate quality but no quality management system Denmark has legally binding national standards for compost quality. The bio- waste needs to comply with certain limit values before being used in a composting and/or biogas process. Robustness of the underlying information The information is based on legal standards. 2.2 Target for the recycling of packaging waste This chapter aims at assessing the prospects of Denmark to achieve the 65 % recycling target for packaging waste in 2025 as well as the material specific packaging waste recycling targets (50 % of plastic; 25 % of wood; 70 % of ferrous metals; 50 % of aluminium; 70 % of glass; 75 % of paper and cardboard). In order to conclude on this likelihood, the analysis takes stock of the status of several factors that are proven to influence the levels of recycling in a country. For a detailed description of the methodology followed, the development of success/risk factors and their impact on recycling, please consult the methodology report (ETC/CE & ETC/WMGE, 2022). 2.2.1 Current situation and past trends SRF P-1.1 Distance to target The actual distance to the target for the most recent data point is a key factor determining the likelihood of meeting or not meeting the target. This analysis is based on data reported by Denmark to Eurostat in accordance with Commission Decision 2005/270/EC as last amended by the Commission Implementing Decision 2019/665 (EC, 2019), published in the dataset Recycling rates of packaging waste for monitoring compliance with policy targets, by type of packaging [env_waspacr]. The latest available data refers to 2019. The performance of Denmark for 2019 is illustrated in Figure 2.2. Figure 2.2 Packaging recycling rates for Denmark in 2019, in percentage Note: No data available for ferrous and aluminium packaging, only for metallic packaging. Source: Eurostat (2022c), EU (2018) For Denmark the reported recycling rates exceed the targets for all packaging materials except of plastics packaging. For total packaging, the recycling exceeds the target by 5.4 percentage points, for paper and cardboard packaging by 22.7 percentage points, for glass by 1.1 percentage points, and for wooden packaging by 32.4 percentage points. For metals, the reported rates do not make a distinction between ferrous metals and aluminium, but the total recycling rate for metals (61.3 %) still exceeds the recycling target for aluminium, but not for ferrous metals. For plastics packaging, the reported recycling rate is 12.6 percentage points below the target (Eurostat, 2022c). However, the recycling rates presented are based on the calculation rules of the Commission Decision 2005/270 before it was amended by the Commission Implementing Decision 2019/665 and will likely differ from the recycling rates to be reported according to the new calculation rules. The new calculation rules will only be mandatory to be used for the reference year 2020 and onwards. A key difference in the new calculation rules compared to the old rules is that the amount of sorted packaging waste that is rejected by the recycling facility shall not be included in the reported amount of recycled packaging waste. Denmark has carried out a preliminary assessment of the impact of the new calculation rules. Currently, the reported data refer to packaging waste collected for recycling and the final recycling rate will refer to the output of recycling. The Danish government has estimated final recycling rates for the year 2018 by accounting for average loss rates per waste type (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021). If the same reduction in the rates (in percentage points) are used to calculate the impact of the new calculation rules to the reported data for the year 2019, the recycling rates would decrease as follows: • Paper and cardboard packaging waste by 3 per cent points from 99.7 % to 96.7 % • Metal packaging waste by 10 per cent points from 61.3 % to 51.3 % • Glass packaging waste by 3 per cent points from 71.1 % to 68.1 % • Plastic packaging waste by 17 per cent points from 37.4 % to 20.4 % • Wood packaging waste by 4 per cent points from 57.4 % to 53.4 % • Total packaging: Calculated based on the amounts of each packaging material generated and recycled in 2019, the recycling rate would drop from 70.4 % to 64.1 %. The waste generation data includes also privately imported packaging, and for plastics and paper/cardboard also estimates for online sales (Eurostat, 2020b). It is likely that the currently reported recycling rate of 99.7 % is overestimated for paper and cardboard packaging. The latest Danish composition analysis of mixed household waste (Miljøstyrelsen, 2018) found that 3.1 % of this waste was cardboard, corresponding to around 31 000 tonnes in 2017 (the same study reports the amount of mixed household waste to be 995 000 tonnes). If it is assumed that most of this cardboard is packaging, around 8 % of the generated paper and cardboard packaging would end up in mixed municipal waste. This estimate does not take into account municipal waste from non-households and paper packaging. Summary result Total packaging < 5 percentage points below target Denmark reports a recycling rate of 70.4 %. If the estimated loss rate provided by Denmark is applied (taking into account losses in the recycling plants), the estimated recycling rate would drop to 64.1 %, 0.9 percentage points below the 2025 target. Paper and cardboard packaging Target exceeded Denmark reports a recycling rate of 99.7 %. If the estimated loss rate provided by Denmark is applied (taking into account losses in the recycling plants), the estimated recycling rate would drop to 96.7 %, 21.7 percentage points above the 2025 target. Ferrous metals packaging > 15 percentage points below target Denmark reports a recycling rate of 61.3 % for total metals packaging. If the estimated loss rate provided by Denmark is applied (taking into account losses in the recycling plants), the estimated recycling rate would drop to 51.3 %, 18.7 percentage points below the target for steel and 1.3 percentage points above the target for aluminium. Aluminium packaging Target exceeded Glass packaging < 5 percentage points below targe Denmark reports a recycling rate of 71.1 %. If the estimated loss rate provided by Denmark is applied (taking into account losses in the recycling plants), the estimated recycling rate would drop to 68.1%, 1.9 percentage points below the 2025 target. Plastics packaging > 15 percentage points below target Denmark reports a recycling rate of 37.4 %. If the estimated loss rate provided by Denmark is applied (taking into account losses in the recycling plants), the estimated recycling rate would drop to 20.4 %, 29.6 percentage points below the 2025 target. Wooden packaging Target exceeded Denmark reports a recycling rate of 57.4 %. If the estimated loss rate provided by Denmark is applied (taking into account losses in the recycling plants), the estimated recycling rate would drop to 53.4 %, 28.4 percentage points above the 2025 target. Robustness of the underlying information The recycling rates used for the assessment referring to 2019 data are estimated, by applying the same reduction (in percentage points) as calculated by the Danish authorities for losses during sorting and recycling for the 2018 data in order to assess the impact of the new calculation rules on the currently reported recycling rates. Separate data for aluminium and ferrous metals packaging are not yet available. The 99.7 % recycling rate for paper and cardboard packaging is very high, indicating that not all generated paper and cardboard waste may be included in the waste generation data. Danish authorities indicate that the methodology for the data on amounts put on the market underestimates the amounts for paper and cardboard and overestimates the amounts for plastics packaging. SRF P-1.2: Past trend in Packaging Waste Recycling The development of the historical trend in the recycling rate indicates previous efforts towards packaging waste recycling. In this analysis the recycling rate reported in the Eurostat dataset Recycling rates of packaging waste for monitoring compliance with policy targets, by type of packaging [env_waspacr] (latest data year: 2019) is used. The recycling trends for packaging waste by material in Denmark are illustrated in Figure 2.3. Figure 2.3 Trend in packaging waste recycling rates in Denmark between 2015 and 2019, in percentage Source: Eurostat (2022c) The overall packaging recycling rate for the past five years started at 73.9 % in 2015, peaked at 79 % in 2016 and dropped to 70.4 % in 2019. The recycling rate of paper and cardboard packaging increased from 95.3 % in 2015 to 99.7 % in 2019. Plastic packaging increased from 30.5 % in 2015 to 37.4 % in 2019, while it peaked in 2017 at 41.8 %. The recycling rate of wooden packaging has plummeted; starting at 75.9 % in 2015 and peaking at 87.3 % in 2016, the recycling rate was 57.4% in 2019. The strong rise and drop in recycling of wooden packaging is influenced by the supply of and replacement of re-used wooden pallets and recycling activities may not take place the same year as waste generation (Eurostat, 2020b). The recycling rate of metallic packaging showed a decrease of 10.6 percentage points during the five years, and for glass packaging a decrease with 8.4 percentage points. (Eurostat, 2022c) The Danish calculation methodology for packaging waste generation is to be updated (Eurostat, 2020b), which may improve the data also on recycling rates. Summary result Total packaging RR > 60% and increase in last 5 years < 5 percentage points The recycling rate decreased by 3.5 percentage points over the past five years, and is estimated to be 64.1 % in 2019 applying the estimated loss rate provided by Denmark. Paper and cardboard packaging RR > 75% The recycling rate increased by 4.4 percentage points over the past five years, and is estimated to be 96.7 % in 2019 applying the estimated loss rate provided by Denmark. Ferrous metals packaging RR < 60% and increase in last 5 years < 10 percentage points The recycling rate decreased by 10.6 percentage points over the past five years, and is estimated to be 51.3 % in 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Percentage Packaging Paper and cardboard packaging Plastic packaging Wooden packaging Metallic packaging Glass packaging Aluminium packaging RR > 50% 2019 applying the estimated loss rate provided by Denmark. Glass packaging RR > 65% and increase in last 5 years < 5 percentage points The recycling rate decreased by 8.4 percentage points over the past five years, and is estimated to be 68.1 % in 2019 applying the estimated loss rate provided by Denmark. Plastics packaging RR < 40% and increase in last 5 years < 10 percentage points The recycling rate increased by 6.9 percentage points over the past five years, and is estimated to be 20.4 % in 2019 applying the estimated loss rate provided by Denmark. Wooden packaging RR > 25% The recycling rate decreased by 18.5 percentage points over the past five years, and is estimated to be 53.4 % in 2019 applying the estimated loss rate provided by Denmark. Robustness of the underlying information There are no breaks in the time series for 2015-2019 indicated in the dataset. The estimated recycling rates used for the assessment referring to 2019 data are estimated by applying the same reduction (in percentage points) as calculated by the Danish authorities for losses during sorting and recycling for the 2018 data in order to assess the impact of the new calculation rules on the currently reported recycling rates. Separate data for aluminium and ferrous metals packaging are not yet available. 2.2.2 Legal instruments SRF P-2.1: Timely transposition of the revised Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive into national law Timely transposition of the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive as amended by Directive 2018/852, into national law within the foreseen period is key for a waste management system in line with EU requirements. Summary result Transposition without delay Denmark has transposed the amended Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive into national law by the transposition deadline. Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the European Commission (status as of 12 November 2021). SRF P-2.2: Responsibilities for meeting the targets, and enforcement mechanisms, e.g. fines etc. As described in Section 2.1.2, the current responsibilities, enforcement mechanisms and support tools for meeting the targets are well defined. Packaging waste is under the same administration as municipal waste. However, the implementation process for setting up a general EPR scheme has started (see Section 2.1.5), with the aim to transfer the responsibility for packaging recycling to the producers. The EPR scheme for packaging will be introduced no later than 31 December 2024 and will include all types of packaging in all types of materials. Decisions about the organisation and administrative setup for the EPR system have not yet been made and thus forthcoming responsibilities for meeting the packaging waste targets in Denmark are not fully defined. Summary result Unclear responsibilities, weak/no enforcement mechanisms and lack of support tools for meeting the recycling targets Denmark has planned to implement an EPR scheme for packaging waste by the end of 2024, but the configuration of the scheme, enforcement and support mechanisms are not yet defined. Robustness of the underlying information Reliable information provided by the Danish authorities in the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire. The implementation process for setting up an EPR scheme for packaging in Denmark has started but decisions about the organisation and administrative setup for the EPR system have not yet been made and thus forthcoming responsibilities are not fully defined. 2.2.3 Economic instruments SRF P-3.1: Taxes and/or ban for landfilling residual- or biodegradable waste Bans and taxes on landfilling of residual waste can help to discourage landfilling and thus support recycling, also of packaging waste. As described in Section 2.1.3 in more detail, Denmark has a landfill tax and a landfill ban in place. Summary result Ban in place for landfilling residual or biodegradable waste Denmark has a landfill ban in place Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the Danish authorities through the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire. SRF P-3.2: Taxes on municipal waste incineration Taxes on incineration of residual waste can help to discourage strong reliance on residual waste treatment and thus support recycling. As described in Section 2.1.3 in more detail, Denmark has an incineration tax in place annually adjusted by the net price index. Summary result Taxes > 18 EUR/t(a) If an energy content of 10.6 GJ/tonne is assumed, the incineration tax alone would be about 75 EUR/t (corresponding to 53 EUR/t rescaled based on purchasing power parities). Furthermore, a CO2-tax is levied on incinerated of non-biodegradable waste. Robustness of the underlying information The underlying information provided by the Danish authorities can be considered robust. The calculation of the total incineration tax rate is based on assumptions. (a) Note: Rescaled based on purchasing power parities Eurostat (2020a) SRF P-3.3: Packaging taxes Packaging taxes can support the aim to reduce packaging waste generation and/or to influence the choice of packaging materials and encourage recyclability and eco-design. According to the information available, Denmark implements packaging taxes with an escalator (taxes on packaging, bags and disposable tableware are indexed with 5.5 % in 2024), as presented in Table 2.2. The packaging taxes focus on beverage packaging (excl. dairy), PVC films for food, bags and disposable tableware. Packaging that is included in the deposit return scheme is exempted from the packaging taxes. Table 2.2 Packaging taxes in Denmark in 2021; DKK per kg and DKK per item.

Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the Danish authorities through the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire. SRF P-3.4: Pay-as-you-throw (PAYT) system in place As a large share of packaging waste is generated in households, incentivising households to separate packaging waste at source, e.g. by applying PAYT systems, is relevant for meeting the recycling targets for packaging waste. As described in Section 2.1.3 in more detail, Denmark has a policy for municipal waste collection which allows for the possibility of PAYT-schemes but municipalities often do not implement PAYT. Summary result PAYT scheme implemented in some regions/ municipalities (50-80% of population covered) Denmark has a policy for municipal waste collection which allows for the possibility of PAYT-schemes but municipalities often do not implement PAYT Robustness of the underlying information It is unclear how strong the economic incentive is for citizens to place waste in the bins for recyclables instead of in the bin for residual waste. Recent information about the shares of the different systems (volume based, frequency of collection, weight based) is not available. SRF P-3.5: Deposit return systems Deposit Return Systems (DRS) generate high capture rates for packaging covered by the system and thus contribute to increased recycling rates. The Danish Deposit and return scheme is regulated in the Statutory Order on Deposits. Dansk Retursystem A/S runs the deposit and return scheme in Denmark. Requirements on the targeted return percentage is agreed between the Danish Ministry of Environment and DRS. The Danish DRS covers the following packaging (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; Miljøministeriet, 2020a): • Beer; • Carbonated beverages (such as soft drinks with an alcohol content of 0–0.5 %); • Other fermented drink products (such as cider with an alcohol content of less than 10 %); • Mixer products in which spirits, wine or other fermented products are mixed with other beverages such as soft drinks, cider or juice (such as alcoholic soft drinks with alcohol content exceeding 0.5 % but not exceeding 10 %); • Mineral water, water, lemonade, iced tea and similar products that are non-carbonated and ready to drink; • Concentrated cordial intended to be diluted before it is consumed; • Pure juice of fruits and vegetables; • Smoothies (without milk). Summary result Aluminium drink cans Mandatory DRS for nearly all drink cans The mandatory system covers nearly all drink cans (see above list) Glass drink bottles Mandatory DRS for nearly all drink bottles The mandatory system covers nearly all drink glass bottles (see above list) Plastic drink bottles Mandatory DRS for nearly all drink bottles The mandatory system covers nearly all plastic bottles (see above list) Plastic crates Voluntary DRS for some specific plastic crates The voluntary system covers some specific plastic crates for beers and sodas Wooden packaging No DRS for wooden packaging Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the Danish authorities through the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire. 2.2.4 Separate collection system SRF P-4.1: Convenience and coverage of separate collection for different packaging waste fractions As a large part of packaging waste comes from households, separate collection systems for households and similar sources are a key condition for high recycling rates for packaging waste and for collecting recyclables at adequate quality. Such systems generally deliver better results the more convenient and accessible they are for their users, also compared to the collection of residual waste. The material specific assessment considers packaging waste from both household and non-household sources. For assessing the convenience and coverage of separate collection systems for households, the same methodology is used here as described in section 2.1.4. As described in Section 2.1.4 in more detail, separate collection is mandatory in Denmark for both households and companies (non-households). Summary result Paper and cardboard packaging 1. Packaging waste from households A high share of the population is covered by high convenience collection services Danish municipalities apply different separate collection schemes for the collection of paper and cardboard waste, but door-to-door separate collection and high-density bring points dominate. 2. Packaging waste from non-household sources Separation at source is mandatory for non-household paper and cardboard packaging waste Separation at source is mandatory in Denmark for companies Ferrous metals packaging 1. Packaging waste from households A high share of population is covered by high convenience collection services Denmark applies all separate collection alternatives for the collection of metals, except low-density bring points in urban areas and civic amenity sites in rural areas. 2. Packaging waste from non-household sources Separation at source is mandatory for non-household ferrous metals packaging waste Separation at source is mandatory in Denmark for companies Aluminium packaging Packaging waste from households A high share of population is covered by high convenience collection services Denmark applies all separate collection alternatives for the collection of metals, except low-density bring points in urban areas and civic amenity sites in rural areas. Plastics packaging 1. Packaging waste from households A high share of population is covered by high convenience collection services Denmark applies all separate collection alternatives for the collection of plastics, except low-density bring points in urban areas and civic amenity sites in rural areas. 2. Packaging waste from non-household sources Separation at source is mandatory for non-household plastic packaging waste Separation at source is mandatory in Denmark for companies Glass packaging 1. Packaging waste from households A high share of the population is covered by high convenience collection services Denmark applies all separate collection alternatives for the collection of glass waste. More than 70 % of the municipalities either have door-to-door collection services or collect glass in cubes within walking distance of the household. 2. Packaging waste from non-household sources Separation at source is mandatory for non-household glass packaging waste Separation at source is mandatory in Denmark for companies Wooden packaging Packaging waste from non-household sources Separation at source is mandatory for non-household wooden packaging waste Separation at source is mandatory in Denmark for companies Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the Danish authorities through the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire. Quantitative information on the shares of the population covered by the different systems is not available. Note: The main source for aluminium packaging waste is drink cans from households, therefore the assessment does not consider aluminium non-household waste. SRF P-4.2: Firm plans to improve the convenience of separate collection for the different packaging waste fractions Concrete plans are needed to improve the convenience and coverage of separate collection. This SRF is only relevant for MS and materials that do not score ‘green’ in SRF P-4.1. The assessment is done on a material basis, and summing up the scores of the different materials according to their average share in packaging waste1. Again, the material specific assessment considers packaging waste from both household and non-household sources. As described in Section 2.1.4 in more detail, as of July 2021 all municipalities in Denmark are obliged to arrange unified separate collection schemes. The collection should be door-to-door if possible with respect to the types of buildings/housing area. Depending on the population density, also high-density bring points can be used. 1 Based on data from Eurostat on the share of packaging materials in total packaging generated in 2018 Summary result Paper and cardboard packaging 1. Packaging waste from households Firm plans to improve the separate collection system, with clear responsible entities and defined targets and timeline. By end of 2022 at the latest, all municipalities in Denmark are obliged to arrange separate collection schemes with a high service level. 2. Packaging waste from non-household sources N/A (for countries already implementing mandatory sorting at source for non-household ferrous metals packaging waste) Ferrous metals packaging 1. Packaging waste from households Firm plans to improve the separate collection system, with clear responsible entities and defined targets and timeline. By end of 2022 at the latest, all municipalities in Denmark are obliged to arrange separate collection schemes with a high service level. 2. Packaging waste from non-household sources N/A (for countries already implementing mandatory sorting at source for non-household paper and cardboard packaging waste) Aluminium packaging Packaging waste from household sources N/A (for countries already covering > 80% of the population by high convenience points) Glass packaging 1.

Packaging waste from households Firm plans to improve the separate collection system, with clear responsible entities and defined targets and timeline. By end of 2022 at the latest, all municipalities in Denmark are obliged to arrange separate collection schemes with a high service level. 2. Packaging waste from non-household sources N/A (for countries already implementing mandatory sorting at source for non-household plastic packaging waste) Wooden packaging Packaging waste from non-household sources N/A (for countries already implementing mandatory sorting at source for non-household wooden packaging waste) Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the Danish authorities through the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire. 2.2.5 Extended producer responsibility (EPR) and similar schemes SRF P-5.1: Coverage of EPR schemes As described in Section 2.1.5 in more detail, Denmark has no general EPR schemes for packaging yet but only a deposit-return system for beverage packaging as described in section 2.1.5. Summary result Not all main packaging fractions(a) are covered by EPR schemes Denmark has no EPR scheme for all packaging yet. Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the Danish authorities through the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire. (a) Note: Paper and cardboard, Ferrous metals, Aluminium, Glass, Plastic SRF P-5.2: Fee modulation in EPR schemes for packaging As explained in Section 2.1.5, fee modulation (or eco-modulation) is a system with different fees for different types of packaging material and designs. The assessment is the same as described in Section 2.1.5 Summary result No EPR scheme and no advanced fee modulation. Denmark has no EPR scheme for all packaging yet, and thus no fee modulation. Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the Danish authorities through the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire. SRF P-5.3 Material specific EPR assessment The material specific assessment is based on a combination of the coverage of the material specific EPR schemes and the use of fee modulation for the specific packaging material. The assessment takes the different situations for different types of materials into account: Plastics packaging is the packaging material that is the most difficult to recycle out of the packaging materials targeted by the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive. Fee modulation therefore plays a larger role for plastic packaging than for the other materials and is therefore rated differently from paper/cardboard, ferrous metals, aluminium and glass. The methodology foresees a green score for plastics packaging only if all four fee modulation assessment criteria mentioned above are met. On the other hand, wooden packaging is mainly generated by commercial and industrial sources and fee modulation is less relevant, therefore the methodology only relies on EPR schemes for wooden packaging from commercial and industrial sources. As described in Section 2.1.5 in more detail, Denmark has no EPR schemes for packaging waste yet. Denmark has a deposit return system for beverage packaging made of plastic, glass or aluminium which operates similar to an EPR scheme as described above. Summary result SRF P-5.3.1 EPR scheme for Paper and cardboard packaging waste No EPR scheme Denmark has no EPR schemes yet. SRF P-5.3.2 EPR scheme for Ferrous metals packaging waste No EPR scheme Denmark has no EPR schemes yet. SRF P-5.3.3 EPR scheme for Aluminium packaging waste No EPR scheme Denmark has no EPR schemes yet. SRF P-5.3.4 EPR scheme for Glass packaging waste No EPR scheme Denmark has no EPR schemes yet. SRF P-5.3.5 EPR scheme for Plastic packaging waste No EPR scheme Denmark has no EPR schemes yet. SRF P-5.3.6 EPR scheme for Wooden packaging waste No EPR scheme Denmark has no EPR schemes yet. Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the Danish authorities through the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire. 34 2.3 Target on landfill of municipal waste 2.3.1 Current situation and past trends SRF LF-1.1: Distance to target The Landfill Directive (1999/31/EC), as amended by Directive (EU) 2018/850, sets a target to reduce, by 2035, the amount of municipal waste landfilled to 10 % or less of the total amount of municipal waste generated (by weight). Data to show the current rate of landfilling in line with the reporting rules will only be reported by mid-2022. Therefore, this analysis calculates the landfilling rate based on the current Eurostat dataset Municipal waste by waste management operations [env_wasmun]; by dividing the amount of landfilled waste by the total amount of waste generated. The overall landfilling rate of Denmark was 0.9 % in 2020 (Eurostat, 2022a) . Denmark has a very high incineration capacity, roughly double the amount of municipal waste sent to incineration, and thus landfill rates are expected to stay at a low level also in the future (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021). Summary result Target exceeded The landfilling rate of Denmark was slightly below 1 % in 2020. Robustness of the underlying information The data is derived from Eurostat and is considered to be rather robust. However, the reported landfill rate might increase once the new calculation rules laid down in the Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/1885 will be applied. Based on the available information, it is currently not possible to quantify the impact of the new calculation rules on the landfill rate. SRF LF-1.2: Past trend in municipal solid waste landfill rate Over the past five years, the overall landfilling rate of Denmark has remained steady at about 1 % (Figure 2.4). Figure 2.4 Landfilling in Denmark between 2015 and 2020, in percentage Source: Eurostat (2022a) Summary result Landfill rate < 10% The landfill rate of Denmark was about 1 % throughout the period 2016 to 2020. Robustness of the underlying information The data is derived from Eurostat and is considered to be rather robust. There is no break in the time series data. SRF LF-1.3: Diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from landfill According to Art. 5(2c) of the EU Landfill Directive, Member States had to ensure that by 2016, biodegradable municipal waste going to landfills is reduced to 35 % of the total amount (by weight) of biodegradable municipal waste produced in 1995 or the latest year before 1995 for which standardised Eurostat data is available. Denmark reported 0 % biodegradable waste landfilled in 2019 as share of the biodegradable waste generated in 1995, and performs therefore well within the target (EC, 2021). Summary result Target for reducing the amount of biodegradable municipal waste (BMW) landfilled to 35% of BMW generated in 1995 has been achieved in 2016 Denmark has reported 0 % biodegradable waste landfilled in 2019 as share of the biodegradable waste generated in 1995 and performs therefore well within the target. Robustness of the underlying information Based on officially reported data which is well in line with otherwise reported statistical data on landfilling of municipal waste. 3 Conclusion This risk assessment indicates whether Denmark at risk of not meeting the targets. The ‘total risk’ categorization is the result of the sum of the individual scores of each SRF as described in the previous chapter, where the assessment of each SRF results in a score of 2 points (green), 1 point (amber) or 0 points (red), depending on the assessment of the SRF. As some SRFs are considered to have a higher impact on meeting the target, the score of the SRF is multiplied by the defined weight of the SRF. As some SRFs might not be applicable to Denmark, only the SRFs relevant to Denmark are taken into account to define the maximum score. Denmark is considered to be ‘not at risk’ if its score is more than 50 % of this maximum score, and ‘at risk’ if its score is less than 50 % of this maximum score. 3.1 Prospects for meeting the recycling target for municipal solid waste 65 % of maximum score Based on the provided information and the analysis done, it is concluded that Denmark is not at risk for not meeting the municipal waste recycling target in 2025. Current situation and past trends: The recycling rate was at 53.9 % in 2020, which is 1.1 percentage points below the 2025 target. Considering, however, the impact of the new calculation rules, Denmark has estimated the impact of the application of the new calculation rules on the recycling rate, with the result that the recycling rate would drop by 8 percentage points, to 45.9 %, or 9.1 percentage points below the target. Denmark has an increasing trend in recycling; the recycling rate has increased with 5.6 percentage points during the past five years. Legal instruments: The amended WFD has been transposed into national law in Denmark by the transposition deadline. Denmark reports clearly defined responsibilities, as well as clearly defined enforcement mechanisms for meeting the targets on recycling of municipal waste, in addition Denmark also presents support mechanisms to improve the implementation of the responsible entities. Economic instruments: There is a landfill ban for biodegradable waste and high taxes on both landfilling and incineration. Denmark has a policy for municipal waste collection which allows for the possibility of PAYT-schemes but municipalities often do not implement PAYT. Separate collection systems: A high share of population is covered by high convenience collection services for paper and cardboard, metals, wood, glass, plastics and WEEE. A medium share of population is covered by high convenience collection services for bio-waste. A low share of population is covered by high convenience collection services for textiles. By the end of 2022 at the latest, high convenience separate collection of all examined fractions except wood waste and WEEE will be mandatory in all municipalities in Denmark, which will improve the service level and can be expected to increase the capture rates of recyclables and recycling rates. Extended producer responsibility: The implementation process for setting up an EPR scheme has started. The implementation of an EPR scheme, covering all main packaging materials, is expected to have a positive impact on the separate collection of packaging waste which will, in turn, also impact the capture rates and recycling of municipal waste. Bio-waste treatment capacity and quality management: Increasing the bio-waste treatment capacity is required in order to meet the increasing volumes of separately collected bio-waste. The Danish authorities report the required capacity demand for the treatment of biowaste will be covered by the private sector or the municipalities. Denmark has legally binding national standards for compost quality, but no quality management system yet. 3.2 Prospects for meeting the recycling targets for packaging waste 76 % of maximum score Based on the provided information and the analysis done, it is concluded that Denmark is not at risk for not meeting the 65 % recycling target for packaging waste in 2025 84 % of maximum score Paper and cardboard Not at risk 45 % of maximum score Ferrous metals packaging At risk 84 % of maximum score Aluminium packaging Not at risk 82 % of maximum score Glass packaging Not at risk 46 % of maximum score Plastics packaging At risk 78 % of maximum score Wooden packaging Not at risk Current situation and past trends: The total packaging recycling rate (applying the new calculation rules) in 2019 was 64.1 %, 0.9 percentage points below the 2025 target. There was a small trend of decreasing recycling rates for the period 2015-2019, and the recycling rate in 2019 was lower than in 2015. Plastics and ferrous packaging waste is more than 15 percentage points below the target, once losses during sorting and recycling are taken into account. One of the main reasons for the poor performance on plastics packaging might be that plastics sorting at source is still new to Danish citizens. Legal instruments: The amended Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive has been transposed into national law. Responsibilities for meeting the packaging waste targets are planned to change with the introduction of EPR for packaging, however the organisational set-up for the EPR scheme for packaging is to be decided, and enforcement and support mechanisms are therefore not yet clear. Economic instruments: There is a landfill ban for biodegradable waste and a high tax on incineration. Denmark applies taxes on packaging. There is a policy for municipal waste collection which allows for the possibility of PAYT-schemes but municipalities often do not implement PAYT. Denmark has a mandatory DRS is in place for all aluminium cans, plastic and glass bottles and a voluntary DRS for some specific plastic crates. There is no DRS for wooden packaging. Separate collection systems: As of July 2021 and by end of 2022 at the latest, door-to-door or high convenience bring point separate collection of all packaging materials except wood waste will be mandatory in all municipalities in Denmark, aiming to further improve the service level and increase the collection rates for packaging waste. The need for improvement and introduction of additional mandatory separate collection requirements are a sign of the data on rate of collection for recycling for paper and cardboard not being accurate, indicating also that the data for other packaging waste recycling may not be robust. Separation at source is mandatory in Denmark for both households and also for companies. Extended producer responsibility: Denmark does not have an EPR scheme for packaging yet. Denmark has a deposit return system covering beverage packaging, which operates similar to an EPR-scheme. The process for setting up an EPR scheme for all packaging has started and it is intended to be introduced no later than 31 December 2024. It will cover all types of packaging in all types of materials. 3.3 Prospects of meeting the landfill of municipal waste target 100 % of maximum score Based on the provided information and the analysis done, it is concluded that Denmark is not at risk for not meeting the 2035 target to reduce the amount of municipal waste landfilled to 10 % or less of the total amount of municipal waste generated. Current situation and past trends: The landfilling rate in 2020 was 0.9 %. Over the past five years, the overall landfilling rate of Denmark was about 1 %. Keeping the low landfilling rate should be no problem due to the high incineration capacity in Denmark. Diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from landfill: Denmark reported 0 % biodegradable waste landfilled in 2019 in as share of the biodegradable waste generated in 1995, and performs therefore well within the target.

The action plan was drafted in 2020 and sent for consultation in December 2020. The final plan was published June 2021. The Action Plan for Circular Economy describes the Danish targets, indicators, policies and initiatives in the entire circular value chain, which ranges from design and consumption to waste management. Foreseen budget for implementation of the programme No specific budget for the implementation of the programme is included in the programme. WASTE GENERATION The following figures illustrate the progress towards waste prevention and decoupling of waste generation from economic growth in Denmark: Municipal solid waste (MSW) Denmark’s municipal waste generation has decreased slightly over the past decade (Figure 1). According to data published by Eurostat, Denmark generated 802 kg/cap of municipal waste, which is significantly above the estimated EU27 average of 513 kg/cap. However, according to latest revised Danish waste statistics, is was 746 kg/cap in 2022 (Ministry of Environment of Denmark, 2025). Figure 1 Municipal waste generation in Denmark (kg per capita), 2004-2022 Source: Eurostat [ENV_WASMUN]. Note: Note: No data is available for 2010. As of reference year 2020, new reporting rules apply for calculating recycled municipal waste pursuant to the targets laid down in Article 11.2(c-e) of Directive 2008/98/EC. These new reporting rules have been implemented in Denmark for reference year 2020 onwards. The data for 2020-2022 will be revised (Ministry of Environment of Denmark, 2025). 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 WPP WPP Total waste The total amount of waste generated in Denmark increased until 2018 and has decreased since (Figure 2). This trend is primarily driven by the largest waste categories, namely soils and mineral waste from construction and demolition. When excluding mineral waste, recyclable wastes and mixed ordinary wastes dominate as largest waste fractions. Denmark’s GDP increased throughout the considered time period, with the exception of a reduction in 2020, most likely due to the Covid-19 outbreak. While a longer data series is required for confirmation, latest data points suggest a potential decoupling between waste generation and economic growth. Figure 2 Generation of waste (total and excluding major mineral wastes), population and economic development, 2010-2022 Source: Eurostat [ENV_WASGEN, NAMA_10_PC, DEMO_GIND]. Note: Waste generation data for odd years are interpolated. WASTE PREVENTION PROGRAMME Objectives and priorities 1. Waste prevention objectives of the Programme - quantitative objectives (waste reduction) - qualitative objectives (reduction of hazardous substances/ environmental impacts) The Danish Government is committed to ensure less waste and better use of natural resources by e.g.: • Strengthen efforts to include circular economy in EU eco-design regulations • Introduce mandatory use of ecolabels in state procurement • decreasing the level of limescale in drinking water (leading to, among others extended durability for electronics and reduced consumption of cleaning agents) • Introduce mandatory use of total cost of ownership in state procurement Create a clear framework for municipal second-hand shops 2. Sectors covered the Action Plan for Circular Economy focuses on three areas with significant environmental and climate impact: • biomass, • construction and • plastics 3. Priority waste types • biomass, • construction and • plastics 4. Target groups The programme focuses on possible measures by public institutions, industry and households Targets, indicators and monitoring 1. Indicators used to monitor progress Denmark’s action plan for circular economy includes a number of indicators of which the following address waste prevention: • Total waste sector CO2e emission (mil. tonnes) • Less waste and better use of natural resources • Municipal waste per capita (kg) • Material footprint (RMC per capita) (tonnes) • Resource productivity (BNP/RMC) (DKK per kg) • Number of products and services with Nordic Swan Ecolabel • Turnover of products and services with Nordic Swan Ecolabel (billion DKK) • Circular material use rate (recycling and mate-rial recovery compared to DMC) • Climate footprint of public procurement (mill. tons CO2e) • Significantly reduce the amount of marine waste • Reduce the amount of food waste in all parts of the food value chain • Reduce the environmental impact from construction and demolition o Proportion of constructions certified with the Nordic Swan Ecolabel, DGNB, LEED or BREEAM • Reduce consumption and improve reuse and recycling of plastics o Amount of marketed plastic packaging (1000 tonnes) o Amount of certain types of single-use products (tonnes) o Separate collection of plastic bottles 2. Quantitative targets 3. Monitoring mechanism of the programme • Status for implementation of the 129 initiatives and progress on indicators will be reported to parliament every year. 4. Evaluation of the programme The implementation of the programme will be evaluated after six years. Based on the annual monitoring of the above outlined indicators, additional measures might be introduced in order to fulfil the indicated targets. Prevention measures Implemented prevention measures according to Article 9 The waste prevention programme includes the following measures that are proposed to avoid waste generation (Chapter 1.5): Table 1: Specific waste prevention measures structured according to Art 9 WFD Promote and support sustainable consumption models • Quality standards for green procurement and training in green procurement is developed (2021- ). • All public procurement must be eco-labeled by 2030. Encourage the design, manufacturing and use of products that are resource-efficient, durable (including in terms of life span and absence of planned obsolence), reparable, re-usable and upgradable. • A guide for design of reusable packaging was published on a multistakeholder platform in 2019 (plast.dk) • Some state procurement to include total cost of ownership criteria. Target products containing critical raw materials to prevent that those materials become waste. • EU has set targets for separate collection of batteries • The EPR organisation Elretur has established an experience exchange forum for municipalities and waste companies that either already work towards reuse in the field of electronics or aspire to it. • A major part of municipal waste centers organizes C2C exchange of used electronic good or make them available in their thrift shops1. Encourage the re-use of products and the setting up of systems promoting repair and re-use activities, including in particular for electrical and electronic equipment, textiles and furniture, as well as packaging and construction materials and products. • Collection of electronic products will be improved in order to support reuse; also cooperations with local reuse networks. • circle house project. Encourage, as appropriate and without prejudice to intellectual property rights , the availability of spare parts, instruction manuals, technical information, or other instruments, equipment or software enabling the repair and re-use of products without compromising their quality and safety. • The government is committed to strengthen its efforts to include circular economy in EU eco-design regulations 1 https://www2.mst.dk/Udgiv/publikationer/2020/01/978-87-7038-158-1.pdf Reduce waste generation in processes related to industrial production, extraction of minerals, manufacturing, construction and demolition, taking into account best available techniques. • Denmark’s circular action plan’s one key sector is construction. • The government is committed to update the Building Regulations with elements from the voluntary sustainability class and introduce increasing limit values for climate footprint from buildings. It will also introduce requirements for standardised demolition plans. • Exchange platforms for construction elements and materials will be supported. • A specific obligation to explore prevention potentials in construction projects will be evaluated. • Modular construction enabling reuse of construction elements is piloted in the Circle House project.2 Reduce the generation of food waste in primary production, in processing and manufacturing, in retail and other distribution of food, in restaurants and food services as well as in households as a contribution to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal to reduce by 50 % per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and to reduce food losses along production and supply chains by 2030. • The national strategy on food waste prevention will be implemented and further developed. • ONE\\THIRD, a think tank operating as an independent organization under the Danish Ministry of Environment is managing ’Denmark against food waste’, a voluntary agreement that unites 25+ food producers and retailers behind the shared mission to halve food waste by 2030. The members of the voluntary agreement co-develop a methodology and metrics to measure food waste reliably that is t ested. ONE\\THIRD publishes a yearly report on general progress on preventing food waste and loss in Denmark. • Other governmental actions include provision of professional assistance to reduce food waste in retail. Encourage food donation and other redistribution for human consumption, prioritising human use over animal feed and the reprocessing into non-food products. • A study on legal options to support food donations will be prepared. • Legal risks and liabilities for food donations will be minimized wherever possible. 2 https://stateofgreen.com/en/partners/3xn/solutions/designing-housing-for-disassembly-and-reuse/ Promote the reduction of the content of hazardous substances in materials and products, without prejudice to harmonised legal requirements concerning those materials and products laid down at Union level, and ensure that any supplier of an article as defined in point 33 of Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council provides the information pursuant to article 33(1) of that regulation to the European Chemicals Agency as from 5 January 2021. • The government to introduce requirements to carry out an environmental and resource survey prior to demolition and major renovations. The survey will map the occurrence of contaminants and the possibility of re-use and recycling of the materials. Reduce the generation of waste, in particular waste that is not suitable for preparing for re-use or recycling. • Danish companies will need to pay for the waste disposal of packaging used for their branded products by 2025. Identify products that are the main sources of littering, notably in natural and marine environments, and take appropriate measures to prevent and reduce litter from such products, where Member States decide to implement this obligation through market restrictions, they shall ensure that such restrictions are proportionate and non-discriminatory. • The environmental organization Plastic Change works for combatting plastic pollution on a global scale. Accredited by UNEA, it works with major brands to reduce plastic packaging, single us sups, plastic bags and the use of microbeads. Based on voluntary work and grants, the organization has distributed knowledge on littering to more than 50 million people worldwide. • The EU Single Use Plastics Directive will be implemented. • EPR system to be introduced to Danish companies for packaging used for their branded products by 2025. Aim to halt the generation of marine litter as a contribution towards the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal to prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds. • Introduce a ban on certain single-use plastics • Reduce the amount of specific forms of plastic take-away packaging by 50 % • Require recycling of a minimum of 60 % of collected plastic waste • Establish a research mission on recycling and reduction of e.g. plastic waste Develop and support information campaigns to raise awareness about waste prevention and littering. • Additional implemented prevention measures, not covered by Article 9 Collection of used textiles Denmark has a long tradition for used textile collection by charities and private actors. Recently municipal waste companies have begun collecting used textiles and textiles waste in civic amenity centres and via door-to-door collection. Some brands/retailers have also experimented with collection. Collection of used textiles from public institutions (hospitals etc. is minimal, as is collection of workwear from business. In Denmark, collection of used textiles is not considered to be waste collection when the collector makes it clear that it only wishes to receive clean, reusable textiles. However, typically 20-30 % of collected textiles are not reusable but are directed to recycling. The Danish government and supporting parties agreed in June 2020 to require Danish municipalities to carry out the separate collection of textile waste from 20223. FOOD WASTE PREVENTION Food waste generation Denmark produces approximately 1,200,000 tonnes food waste from primary production, processing and manufacturing, retail, restaurants and households annually. The amount of food waste from households has decreased by 14,000 tonnes from 2011 to 2017. That is an average decrease in food waste of 8 % per household per week. Measures to prevent food waste ONE\\THIRD, a think tank operating as an independent organization under the Danish Ministry of Environment and Food Their five focus areas are: 1. Support the civil society's battle against food loss and food waste 2. Contribute to general business opportunities relating to food waste prevention 3. Offer insights on how to overcome barriers to preventing food waste and food losses 4. Improve data collection and impact assessment 5. International cooperation on know-how and sharing of experiences Their actions have been described in the previous table (Specific waste prevention measures structured according to Art 9 WFD) The REFOOD label is a scheme for companies and organizations in the food and service sector, for minimising and recycling food waste. Membership requires to choose three food waste reduction initiatives and have a scheme for recycling food waste. in 2021, 1320 organisations hold the refood certificate. Several food donor and food sharing programmes and organisations have emerged during the last years. The NGO Stop Spild Af Mad (“Stop Wasting Food”), the largest movement against food waste pushed for the first “National Day of Food Waste” celebrated on September 29, to raise awareness on the issue. The NGO has launched a food bank called GratisMad (“Free Food”), Food Sharing Copenhagen is also one of Demark’s largest volunteer-led organisations working to raise awareness of and prevent food waste. Food Sharing Copenhagen has built relationships with local fruit and vegetable suppliers and wholesalers and large food sharing events take place once to twice a week Eat GRIM (“Eat Ugly”) delivers food boxes of organic and “ugly” fruit and vegetables, which won’t fit supermarket’s beauty standards, nor the EU’s quality standards. By buying whatever farmers could not sell they have saved around 572 tons of food and created over $1 billion income for farmers. 3 https://www2.mst.dk/Udgiv/publications/2020/06/978-87-7038-202-1.pdf REUSE OF PRODUCTS Data Denmark has not reported any data for reuse of textiles, furniture, electrical and electronic equipment and construction and building materials according to Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/19 for the year 2021 by the reporting deadline (EEA, 2024) Measures to support reuse In the frame of the EU TAIEX-EIR PEER 2 PEER programme, which provides tailored support to Member States' authorities implementing environmental policy and legislation Danish waste organisation has conducted study visits to learn from Belgium on how to create repair and reuse networks4. Aarhus area waste organisation supports reuse in their recycling center, where people can leave things they don’t use anymore and pick up needed used items. Volunteers additionally host exhibitions, events and courses on waste and recycling. Depending on the season, citizens can come by and e.g. fix their bikes etc. The center has 300-350 visitors a day and a yearly turnover of ca 500 tons of objects, furniture, saving ca 550 tons CO2. Each year, about 50 school classes visit REUSE to take part in an interactive education. Moreover, students moving to Aarhus in August can get a free “move-in box” including table ware, pots and pans. Cargo bike are available for free when need to transport bigger objects The smartphone app ‘kleen hub’ allows restaurants to lend their customers reusable stainless steel boxes and coffee mugs instead of using compostable or plastic food containers. Customers can borrow the boxes for up to 10 days and without any cost unless the box is not returned. In collaboration between City of Copenhagen, some NGOs and the industry a guide for reuse and recycling of plastic consumer packaging has been published. It contains considerations when choosing reuse as a business model and design parameters for reuse and reuse case studies5. A collaboration between a major Danish Brewery and four of Denmark’s largest music festivals replaces 2 million disposable plastic cups with reusable cups that can be washed and reused. Previously the four festivals formerly served drinks in more than 2 million disposable plastic cups during the music festivals. Now, the beverages will be served in reusable cups that are collected after use. Then they are washed in a huge, mobile dishwasher that can wash 9,000 cups an hour, which allows the cups to be reused during the festivals. The Knowledge Centre for Circular Economy in Construction guides building owners, contractors, advisers and municipalities on recycling of C&D waste and on problematic substances in rebuilding, renovation and demolition. The advisory board on circular economy has drawn up a number of innovative recommendations for the building sector which are now being implemented. The following actions relate to reuse: • additional information requirements for amounts of reused, recycled and recyclable materials and for undesirable substances in new buildings and large renovation projects from 2020, with a voluntary sustainability classification system for buildings becoming mandatory in 2025 • a standardised, freely available digital building passport, plus a product database for suppliers with digital factsheets for building products • a selective demolition plan to identify materials and the content of hazardous substances, assess materials’ recycling/reuse value and specify demolition methods6. 4 https://www.municipalwasteeurope.eu/newsitem/denmark-belgium-taiex-eir-p2p-study-visit-experts-danish-municipal-waste-management-learn 5 Network for circular plastic packaging. 2019 Design Guide.

However, only part of these fractions are actually reused/recycled, as their appeal is in practice not high enough for the potential next user. Thus, it is not always economically attractive for the municipal waste companies to prepare such products for reuse/recycling. To recovery as much as possible with a practical value, some recycling stations train employees to be able to assess the value of the products used so that these employees can sort the saleable items for their own second-hand shops. Several recycling stations carry out sorting and cleaning of many products before these go on to reuse. A number of recycling stations also repair incoming products (e.g. furniture and white goods) which are sold in their thrift stores. Some recycling stations also has barter markets where customers can return products for customer-customer reuse. Moreover, several municipal recycling stations collect for other actors, including charities which then organise further recycling and reuse (e.g. textiles). Food Sharing Copenhagen Food Sharing Copenhagen is a voluntary based organisation for utilising non-sold food in Copenhagen. In 2019 their collective efforts helped save over 13,000 tons of food waste and nourish over 16,000 people. Every week, they collect surplus food from businesses, including bread and dry goods that would have been thrown out to waste and share it with hundreds of people. The food sharing events take place once to twice a week thanks to a significant number of volunteers. In contrast to most other similar social activities Food sharing Copenhagen was able to keep up its activities also during the pandemic. Under their principles of unconditional sharing, Food Sharing Copenhagen doesn’t make a distinction between those who are accessing the services based on financial disadvantage or those who are simply making an ethical choice. Links to circular economy Waste prevention is an integral part of the comprehensive transformation towards a circular economy. It reduces the input of natural resources into the economy as well as the necessary efforts to collect and recycle waste. Approaches for improving circularity are often highly interlinked with successful waste prevention. The following table shows which circular strategies are explicitly integrated into Denmark's waste prevention programme. Topic Addressed in the programme Comments Eco-design Yes Inter alia by supporting EU eco-design regulation Repair, refurbishment and remanufacture Yes E.g. guided t is organised linked to some municipal waste centers’ activities . Recycling Yes Recycling of municipal waste is covered in the Danish waste management law. Increased recycling of biomass and construction waste are foci in Denmark’s circular economy action plan. Economic incentives and finance Yes Inter alia by assessing how waste prevention can be included in eco-modulated packaging fees. Circular business models Yes E.g. multi-stakeholder platforms for business models aiming to prevent food waste throughout the food chain Eco-innovation Yes E.g. project on construction for disassembly. Governance, skills and knowledge Yes E.g. by integrating waste prevention into comprehensive school curriculum. Training in green procurement for public procurers."

Imports and exports of waste are also covered. The waste accounts build on data from the Danish Environmental Protection Agency and were published for the first time in 2015. Municipal waste by municipality, treatment form and waste type is compiled in 2023.\nStatistical presentation\nWaste accounts measure the amounts of generated waste distributed to 117 industry groups. Within the industry groups, waste is distributed according to categories and forms of treatment. Imports and exports of waste are distributed according to form of treatment and waste category.

The data processing in Statistics Denmark primarily concerns the detailed and complete distribution of the waste to the 117 industry groups of the Green National Accounts.\nRead more about statistical processing\nRelevance\nWaste accounts are of relevance for administrative bodies, researchers, NGOs, businesses, the educational sector and individuals - all with interests in waste, resources, economic-environmental interactions, the circular economy etc. To ensure international comparability, the waste accounts are prepared according to the UN statistical standard SEEA (System of Environmental Economic Accounting) 2012.\nRead more about relevance\nAccuracy and reliability\nThe quality is good concerning the figures for total amounts of waste as well as the amounts for different forms of treatment. The distribution of waste according to categories also has a good quality, even if it is most reliable at the aggregated level. At more detailed level, the precision is less due to measurement errors (in the reporting).\nThe detailed distribution according to industry groups is less precise. This stems from errors in the source data (measurement errors from the reporting) as well as from the assumptions made in the distribution of waste to detailed industry groups.\nWaste by individual municipalities is less precise than totals for the municipality groups. This stems from the data source, and can be linked to waste from one municipality being treated at a facility in a different municipality, waste stations being used by inhabitants of several different municipalities etc.\nRead more about accuracy and reliability\nTimeliness and punctuality\nPublication of the waste accounts was on time, 21 months after the end of the reference period.

The action plan was drafted in 2020 and \nsent for consultation in December 2020. The final plan was \npublished Ju ne 2021. \nThe Action Plan for Circular Economy describes the Danish \ntargets, indicators, policies and initiatives in the entire circular \nvalue chain, which ranges from design and consumption to \nwaste management, from which natural resources are \nrecycled into new products and materials. \n\nForeseen budget for \n\nimplementation of the project \nNo specific budget for the implementation of the programme is \nincluded in the programme. \nWASTE GENERATION The following figures illustrate the progress towards waste prevention and decoupling of waste \ngeneration from economic growth in Denmark :\nMSW  \n\n•\n\nThe generation of municipal waste per capita (see Figure 1) increased from 740 kg per capita \nin 2006 and reach ed its maximum in 201 1 with 862 kg per capita. The trend stagnated after \n2011 and 20 12 -2019 waste generation has remained on the same level 810 -840 kg/capita and \nyear , and in 2020 this dropped somewhat to 814 kg. Denmark’s waste generation is thereby \none of the highest in Europe , compared to the 2020 per capita European average of 517 kg 1. \n\n•\n\nThe first WPP of Denmark came into force in 2013 and, although MSW generation is \ninfluenced by many factors ( e.g. household expenditure), the prevention measures in that \nWPP might partially explain the stable trend in waste generation. To note is that household \nexpenditure increased steadily during the same period 2, thus some decoupling effect may have \noccurred. \nFigure 1: Municipal waste generation in Denmark (kg per capita) , 2006 -20 20 (data unavailable in \n2010) \nSource: Eurostat [ENV_WASMUN] \nTotal waste  \n\n•\n\nDenmark ´s waste generation (excluding major mineral wastes) has fluctuated from 2010 to \n2020 but decreased overall by 4% (see Figure 2). During the same period , Denmark’s GDP \ngrew steadily . \n\n•\n\nAlthough a longer time series is needed to solidify a decoupling conclusion, Denmark seems \nto be on track to decouple total w aste (excluding major mineral wastes) generation from \neconomic growth since 201 0. \n\n•\n\nThere may be slight decoupling between total waste (excluding major mineral wastes) \ngeneration and population growth, which grew slowly during the same period 2010 -2020 .                      \n\n1Based on data collected from Eurostat in September 2022.\n2https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.CON.PRVT.PP.KD?end=2019&locations=DK&start=2012\n650\n700\n750\n800\n850\n900\n2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\nWPP •\n\nBased on the figure , one cannot notice a clear immediate impact of Denmark’s first waste \nprevention programme (2013 - ) on total waste generation . The total waste (excluding major \nmineral wastes) generation is however lower in 2018 compared to 2010. \nFigure 2: Growth rate of waste (excluding major mineral wastes), GDP (main GDP aggregates, chain \nlinked), and population, 2010 -2020, (2010=100). \nSource: Eurostat [ENV_WASGEN, NAMA_10_PC, DEMO_GIND]        \n\n85\n90\n95\n100\n105\n110\n115\n2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020\nPopulation GDP Waste excluding major mineral wastes\n\nWASTE PREVENTION PROGRAMME \nObjectives and priorities \n\nWast e prevention objectives \n\nof the Programme \n\nquantitative objectives \n\n(waste reduction) \n\nqualitative objectives \n\n(reduction of hazardous \nsubstances/ environmental \nimpacts) \nThe Danish Government is commit ted to ensure less waste \nand better use of natural resou rces by e.g.:  \n\n•\n\nStrengthen efforts to include circular economy in EU \neco -design regulations  \n\n•\n\nIntroduce mandatory use of ecolabels in state \nprocurement  \n\n•\n\ndecreasing the level of limescale in drinking water \n(leading to, among others extended durability for \nelectronics and reduced consumption of cleaning agents)  \n\n•\n\nIntroduce mandatory use of total cost of ownership in \nstate procurement  \n\n•\n\nCreate a clear framework for municipal second -hand \nshops \n\nSectors covered  the Action Plan for Circular Economy focuses on three \n\nareas with significant environmental and climate impact:  \n\n•\n\nbiomass,  \n\n•\n\nconstruction and  \n\n•\n\nplastics \n\nPriority waste types  • biomass,  \n\n\n•\n\nconstruction and  \n\n•\n\nplastics \n\nTarget groups  The programme focuses on possible measures by public \n\ninstitutions, industry and households Targets, indicators and monitoring \n\nIndicators proposed  Denmark ’s action plan for circular economy includes a\n\nnumber of indicators of which the following addres s waste \nprevention:  \n\n•\n\nTotal waste sector CO2e emission (mil. tonnes)  \n\n•\n\nLess waste and better use of natural resources  \n\n•\n\nMunicipal waste per capita (kg)  \n\n•\n\nMaterial footprint (RMC per capita) (tonnes)  \n\n•\n\nResource productivity (BNP/RMC) (DKK per kg)  \n\n•\n\nNumber of products and services with Nordic Swan \nEcolabel  \n\n•\n\nTurnover of products and services with Nordic Swan \nEcolabel (bil lion DKK)  \n\n•\n\nCircular material use rate (recycling and mate -rial \nrecovery compared to DMC)  \n\n•\n\nClimate footprint of public procurement (mil l. tons \nCO2e ) \n\n•\n\nSignificantly reduce the amount of marine waste  \n\n•\n\nReduce the amount of food waste in all parts of the food \nvalue chain  \n\n•\n\nReduce the environmental impact from construction and \ndemolition \no Proportion of constructions certified with the \nNordic Swan Ecolabel, DGNB, LEED or \nBREEAM  \n\n•\n\nReduce consumption and improve reuse and recycling of \nplastics \no Amount of marketed plastic packaging (1000 \ntonnes) \no Amount of certain types of single -use products \n(tonnes) \no Separate collection of plastic bottles \n\nQuantitative targets  Targets are set in accordance with EU target e.g.  \n\n\n•\n\nhalving food waste generation until 2030, based on the \nSDG  \n\n•\n\nSeparate collection of plastic bottles >70 % in 2025 >90 \n% in 2029 \n\nMonitoring of programme  • waste intensity will be monitored based on annual reports \n\nby the German statistical office  \n\n•\n\nshare of reusable packaging is monitored by annual \nreports due to the German packaging law \n\nEvaluation of the programme  The implementation of the programme will be evaluated after \n\nsix years.

Collection of used textiles from \npublic institutions ( hospitals etc . is minimal, as is collection of \nworkwear from business. \nIn Denmark , collection of used textiles is not considered to be \nwaste collection when the collector makes it clear that it only \nwishes to receive clean, reusable textiles. However, t ypically 20 -30 \n% of collected textiles are not reusable but are directed to recycling .\nThe Danish government and supporting parties agreed in June 2020 \nto require Danish municipalities to carry out the separate collection \nof textile waste from 2022 5. \n\n5https://www2.mst.dk/Udgiv/publications/2020/06/978 -87 -7038 -202 -1.pdf\n\nFOOD WASTE PREVENTION \nFood waste generation \nDenmark produces approximately 1,20 0,000 tonnes food waste from primary production, processing \nand manufacturing, retail, restaurants and households annually. The amount of food waste from \nhouseholds has decreased by 14,000 tonnes from 2011 to 2017. That is an average decrease in food \nwaste of 8 % per household per week. \nMeasures to prevent food waste \nONE \\THIRD, a think tank operating as an independent organization under the Danish Ministry of \nEnvironment and Food Their five focus areas are: \n\n\nSupport the civil society's battle against food loss and food waste \n\n\nContribute to general business opportunities relating to food waste prevention \n\n\nOffer insights on how to overcome barriers to preventing food waste and food losses \n\n\nImprove data collection and impact assessment \n\n\nInternational c ooperat ion on know -how and sharing of experiences \n\n\nTheir actions have been described in the previous table ( Specific waste prevention measures \nstructured according to Art 9 WFD )\nThe  REFOOD  label is a scheme for companies and organizations in the food and service sector, for \nminimising and recycling food waste. Membership requires to choose three food waste reduction \ninitiatives and have a scheme for recycling food waste. in 2021, 1320 organ isations hold the refood \ncertificate. \nSeveral food donor and food sharing programmes and organisations have emerged during the last \nyears.  The NGO  Stop Spild Af Mad  (“St op Wasting Food”), the largest movement against food waste \npush ed for the first “National Day of Food Waste” celebrated on September 29, to raise awareness on \nthe issue. The NGO has launched a food bank called GratisMad (“Free Food”),  Food Sharing \nCopenhagen  is also one of Demark’s largest volunteer -led organisations working to raise awareness of \nand prevent food waste.

By buying whatever farmers could \nnot sell they have saved aroun d 572 tons of food and created over $1 billion income for farmers. \nREUSE OF PRODUCTS \nData \nWith regard to the Commission I mplementing Decision ( https://eur -lex.europa.eu/legal -\ncontent/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2021.010.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ%3AL%3A2021%3A01 \n0%3ATOC ), this section will be updated by the EEA accordingly. \nMeasures to support ReUse \nIn the frame of the EU TAIEX -EIR PEER 2 PEER programme , which provides tailored support to \nMember States' authorities implementing environmental policy and legislation Danish waste \norganisation has conducted study visits to learn from Belgium on how to create repair and reuse \nnetworks 6. \n\n6https://www.municipalwasteeurope.eu/newsitem/denmark -belgium -taiex -eir -p2p -study -visit -experts -danish -\nmunicipal -waste -management -learn\n\nAarhus area waste organisation supports reuse in their recycling center, where people can leave things \nthey don’t use anymore and pick up needed used items. Volunteers additionally host exhibition s, \nevents and courses on waste and recycling. Depending on the season, citizens can come by and e.g. \nfix their bikes etc . The center has 300 -350 visitors a day and a yearly turnover of ca 500 tons of \nobjects, furniture, saving ca 550 tons CO 2. Each year, a bout 50 school classes visit REUSE to take \npart in an interactive education . Moreover, students moving to Aarhus in August can get a free \n“move -in box” including table ware, pots and pans . C argo bike are available for free when need to \ntransport bigger objects \nThe smartphone app ‘kleen hub ’ allows restaurants to lend their customers reusa ble stainless steel \nboxes and coffee mugs instead of using compostable or plastic food containers. Customers can borrow \nthe boxes for up to 10 days and without any cost unless the box is not returned. \nIn collaboration between City of Copenhagen, some NGO s and the industry a g uide for reuse and \nrecycling of plastic consumer packaging has been published . It contains considerations when choosing \nreuse as a business model and d esign parameters for reuse and reuse case studies 7.\nA collabor ation between a ma jor Danish Brewery and four of Denmark’s largest music festivals \nreplace s 2 million disposable plastic cups with reusable cups that can be washed and reused. \nPreviously the four festivals formerly served drinks in more than 2 million disposable plastic cup s\nduring the music festivals. Now, t he beverages will be served in reusable cups that are collected after \nuse. Then they are washed in a huge, mobile dishwasher that can wash 9,000 cups an hour, which \nallows the cups to be re used during the festivals. \nThe Knowledge Centre for Circular Economy in Construction guides building owners, contractors, \nadvisers and municipalities on recycling of C&D waste and on problematic substances in rebuilding, \nrenovation and demolition. \nThe advisory board on circular econ omy has dr awn up a number of innovative recommendations for \nthe building sector which are now being implemented . The following actions relate to reuse:  \n\n•\n\nadditional information requirements for amounts of reused, recycled and recyclable materials and \nfor und esirable substances in new buildings and large renovation projects from 2020, with a \nvoluntary sustainability classification system for buildings becoming mandatory in 2025  \n\n•\n\na standardised, freely available digital building passport, plus a product database for suppliers \nwith digital factsheets for building products  \n\n•\n\na selective demolition plan to identify materials and the content of hazardous substances, assess \nmaterials’ recycling/reuse value and specify demolition methods 8.\nBest practice examples \nSupport for reuse at municipal recycling stations \nMunicipal recycling stations receive large amounts of waste, which can be prepared for reuse and \nrecycling, including furniture and other furniture, textiles, building materials and electronics. \nHowever, only part of these fractions are actually reused/recycled, as their appeal is in practice not \nhigh enough for the potential next user. Thus, it is no t always economically attractive for the \nmunicipal waste companies to prepare such products for reuse/ recycling. To recovery as much as \npossible with a practical value, s ome recycling stations train employees to be able to assess the value \nof the products used so that these employees can sort the sal eable items for their own second -hand \nshops. Several recycling stations carry out sorting and cleaning of many products before these go on \nto re use . A number of recycling stations also repair incoming products ( e.g. furniture and white \ngoods) which are sold in their thrift stores . Some recycling stations also has barter markets where      \n\n7Network for circular plastic packaging. 2019 Design Guide.

Moreover, several municipal recycling \nstations collect for other actors, including charities which then organise further recycling and reuse \n(e.g. textiles). \nFood Sharing Copenhagen \nFood Sharing Copenhagen is a voluntary based organisation for utilising non -sold food in \nCopenhagen . In 2019 their collective efforts helped save over 13,000 tons of food waste and nourish \nover 16,000 people. Every week, they collect surplus food from businesses, including bread and dry \ngoods that would have been thrown out to waste and share it with hundreds of people. \nThe food sharing events take place once to twice a week thanks to a significant number of volunteers. \nIn contrast to most other similar social activities Food sharing Copenhagen was able to keep up its \nactivities also during the pandemic. Under their principles of uncondi tional sharing, Food Sharing \nCopenhagen doesn’t make a distinction between those who are accessing the services based on \nfinancial disadvantage or those who are simply making an ethical choice. Links to circular economy \nWaste prevention is an integral part of the comprehensive transformation towards a circular economy. \nIt reduces the input of natural resources into the economy as well as the necessary efforts to collect \nand recycle waste. \nApproaches for improving circularity are often highly interlin ked with successful waste prevention. \nThe following table shows which circular strategies are explicitly integrated into the German waste \nprevention programme. \nTopic  Addressed in the \nprogramme \nComments \nEco -design  Yes  Inter alia by supporting EU eco -\ndesign regulation \nRepair, refurbishment and \nremanufacture \nYes  E.g. guided t is organised linked to \nsome municipal waste centers’ \nactivities .\nRecycling  Yes  Recycling of municipal waste is \ncovered in the Danish waste \nmanagement law.

      "raw_content": " 1 OECD, ENVIRONMENT STATISTICS DATABASE Municipal waste (voir ci-dessous pour le français) Database documentation This dataset presents trends in amounts of municipal waste generated (including household waste), and the treatment and disposal method used. The amount of waste generated in each country is related to the rate of urbanisation, the types and pattern of consumption, household revenue and lifestyles. Variables and definitions The average for the OECD is estimated. When interpreting these data, one should keep in mind that definitions and measurement methods vary among countries, and that inter-country comparisons require careful interpretation. One should also note that data presented here refer to national level and may conceal major subnational differences. The indicator on waste generated per GDP is expressed in tonne/USD, where USD = US dollar, 2015 purchasing power parity. Municipal waste Municipal waste includes household waste and similar waste. The definition also includes: • bulky waste (e.g. white goods, old furniture, mattresses); and • yard waste, leaves, grass clippings, street sweepings, the content of litter containers and market cleansing waste, if managed as waste. It includes waste originating from: • households, • commerce and trade, small businesses, office buildings and institutions (schools, hospitals, government buildings). It also includes: • waste from selected municipal services, i.e. waste from park and garden maintenance, • waste from street cleaning services (street sweepings, the content of litters containers, market cleansing waste). if managed as waste. It includes waste from these sources collected: • door-to-door through traditional collection (mixed household waste), and • fractions collected separately for recovery operations (through door-to-door collection and/or through voluntary deposits). Municipal waste refers to waste defined as above, collected by or on behalf of municipalities. The definition also includes waste from the same sources and similar in nature and composition which: • are collected directly by the private sector (business or private non-profit institutions) not on behalf of municipalities (mainly separate collection for recovery purposes), • originate from rural areas not served by a regular waste service, even if they are disposed by the generator. 2  The definition excludes: • waste from municipal sewage network and treatment, • municipal construction and demolition waste. Household waste Waste from households as well as other waste, which, because of its nature or composition, is similar to waste from household. Municipal waste treated Because of recycling, and because treatment methods are not always mutually exclusive, the amounts generated/collected and the sums of the treatment methods are not necessarily the same. Recovery Recovery is defined as any waste management operation that diverts a waste material from the waste stream and which results in a certain product with a potential economic or ecologic benefit. Recovery mainly refers to the following operations: • recycling; • energy recovery, i.e. re-use a fuel; • biological recovery, e.g. composting; • re-use. Direct recycling or re-use within industrial plants at the place of generation is excluded. Waste management Waste management means the collection, transport, treatment and disposal of waste, including after-care of disposal sites. Recycling Recycling is defined as any reprocessing of material in a production process that diverts it from the waste stream, except reuse as fuel. Both reprocessing as the same type of product, and for different purposes are included. Direct recycling within industrial plants at the place of generation are excluded. Composting Biological process that submits biodegradable waste to anaerobic or aerobic decomposition, and that results in a product that is recovered. Disposal Disposal is defined as any waste management operation serving or carrying out the final treatment and disposal of waste. It covers the following main operations: ▪ Final treatment • Incineration without energy recovery (on land; at sea) • Biological, physical, chemical treatment resulting in products or residues that are discarded, i.e. going to final disposal. ▪ Final disposal • Deposit into or onto land (e.g. landfill), including specially engineered landfill (i.e. placement into lined discrete cells which are capped and isolated from one another and the environment). • Deep injection • Surface impoundment  3 OECD, ENVIRONMENT STATISTICS DATABASE • Release into water bodies • Permanent storage Landfill Landfill is defined as a deposit of waste into or onto land, including specially engineered landfill, and temporary storage of over one year on permanent sites. The definition covers both landfill in internal sites (i.e. where a generator of waste is carrying out its own waste disposal at the place of generation) and in external sites. Bulky waste Waste that due to its bulky character needs special considerations for its management. Examples are white goods, old furniture, mattresses, etc., if managed as waste. Excludes hazardous waste and construction and demolition waste.

See below for the country notes ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Déchets municipaux Documentation de la base de données Cette base de données présente les tendances des quantités de déchets municipaux produites (y compris les déchets des ménages), ainsi que les méthodes de traitement et d'élimination utilisées. Les quantités de déchets produites dans chaque pays sont liées au degré d'urbanisation, aux types et structures de consommation ainsi qu'au niveau des revenus et style de vie des ménages. Les variables et définitions La moyenne de l’OCDE est une estimation. Lors de l'interprétation de ces données, il convient de garder à l'esprit que les définitions et les méthodes de mesure varient selon les pays et que les comparaisons entre pays nécessitent une interprétation prudente. Il convient également de noter que les données présentées ici se réfèrent à l'échelle nationale et peuvent masquer d'importantes différences infranationales. L'indicateur des déchets produits par rapport au PIB est exprimé en tonnes/USD, où USD = dollar américain, parité de pouvoir d'achat 2015. 4  Déchets municipaux Les déchets municipaux comprennent les déchets ménagers et assimilés. La définition comprend aussi: • les déchets encombrants (par exemple éléctroménager, vieux mobilier, matelas, etc.); et • les résidus de jardins et d’espaces verts (feuilles, gazon, etc.), les déchets d’entretien de la voirie (nettoyage des rues, contenu des poubelles publiques, déchets de marché) Elle comprend les déchets produits par: • les ménages, • des petites activités commerciales, des petites entreprises, bureaux et institutions (écoles, bâtiments administratifs, hôpitaux). Elle comprend aussi: • les déchets de certains services municipaux, c.à.d. les déchets d’entretien des jardins et espaces verts (feuilles, gazon, etc.) et • les déchets d’entretien de la voirie (nettoyage des rues, contenu des poubelles publiques, déchets de marché) s'ils sont gérés en tant que déchets. Elle comprend les déchets de ces sources collectés: • en porte à porte (collecte traditionnelle de déchets ménagers mixtes), et • collectés par collecte sélective en vue d’opérations de récupération (en porte à porte et/ou par apport volontaire). Pour les besoins de ce questionnaire, les déchets municipaux sont les déchets collectés par ou pour les municipalités. La définition comprend aussi les déchets des mêmes sources et analogues quant à leur nature et leur composition, qui: • sont collectés directement par le secteur privé non pour les municipalités (entreprises et institutions à but non lucratif) (principalement collecte sélective à des fins de récupération), • ainsi que les déchets analogues venant des zones rurales non desservies par un service des déchets régulier, même s'ils sont éliminés par le générateur de déchets. La définition exclut: • les déchets issus de l’assainissement municipal des eaux usées (curage des égouts, épuration); et • les déchets municipaux de construction et de démolition. Déchets menagers et assimilés Les déchets des ménages, et les autres déchets qui, de par leur nature ou leur composition, sont similaires aux déchets des ménages. Traitement Les processus physiques, thermiques, chimiques ou biologiques, qui modifient les caractéristiques des déchets de manière à en réduire le volume ou le caractère dangereux, en faciliter la manipulation ou à en favoriser la valorisation.  5 OECD, ENVIRONMENT STATISTICS DATABASE Gestion des déchets On entend par gestion des déchets, la collecte, le transport et l’élimination des déchets, y compris la surveillance des sites d’élimination. Récupération (ou valorisation) La récupération (ou valorisation) est définie comme toute opération de gestion des déchets qui dévie une matière du flux de déchets et qui résulte en un certain produit ayant un bénéfice économique ou écologique potentiel. La récupération couvre principalement les opérations suivantes: • la récupération matière, c.à.d. le recyclage (voir ci-dessous); • la récupération énergie, c.à.d. la réutilisation comme combustible; • la récupération biologique, p.ex. le compostage; • la réutilisation. Le recyclage et la réutilisation sur place dans l'installation industrielle sont exclus. Recyclage Le recyclage est défini comme toute réintroduction de matière dans un processus de production qui le dévie du flux de déchets, à l'exception de la réutilisation comme combustible. Le recyclage pour le même type de produit ou pour d'autres objectifs sont à inclure. Le recyclage des matériaux sur place dans l'installation industrielle est à exclure. Compostage Processus biologique qui consiste à faire subir une décomposition anaérobie ou aérobie à des déchets biodégradables et qui résulte en un produit qui est valorisé. Élimination Élimination: on entend par élimination toute opération de gestion des déchets servant ou mettant en oeuvre le traitement final et l’élimination finale des déchets. Cela couvre principalement les opérations suivantes: • Traitement final: • incinération sans récupération (à terre; en mer) • traitement biologique, physique et chimique qui résultent en des produits ou résidus qui sont éliminés, c.à.d. destinés à l’élimination finale. • Elimination finale: • dépôt sur ou dans le sol (p.ex. mise en décharge), y compris mise en décharge spécialement aménagée (i.e. placement dans des alvéoles étanches séparées, recouvertes et isolées les unes des autres et de l'environnement) • injection en profondeur • lagunage • rejet dans le milieu aquatique • stockage permanent Mise en décharge La mise en décharge est définie comme le dépôt de déchets sur ou dans la terre, y compris la mise en décharge spécialement aménagée et le stockage temporaire de plus d’un an sur des sites permanents. 6  Comprend aussi bien la mise en décharge dans des sites internes (c.à.d. où un producteur de déchets procède lui-même à l’élimination des déchets sur le lieu de production) et externes. Déchets encombrants Déchets qui en raison de leur caractère encombrant requièrent une gestion particulière. Comprend par exemple l’électroménager, le vieux mobilier, les matelas, etc., s’ils sont gérés en tant que déchets. Ne comprend pas les déchets dangereux et les déchets de démolition et de construction. Sources Cet ensemble de données se fonde principalement sur des données fournies par les pays membres dans le questionnaire sur l'état de l'environnement (OCDE/Eurostat). Cet ensemble de données présente les données fournies par les autorités des pays membres dans le cadre de la collecte annuelle conjointe OCDE/Eurostat (via le questionnaire annuel d'assurance qualité pour les pays ne déclarant pas à Eurostat). Certaines mises à jour ont été effectuées dans le cadre des Examens Environnementaux de l'OCDE. Les données sont harmonisées grâce aux travaux du Groupe de travail de l'OCDE sur l'information environnementale (WPEI) et bénéficient des efforts continus déployés par les pays membres de l'OCDE, l'OCDE elle-même et d'autres organisations internationales pour améliorer la qualité des données.

Data refer to financial years (e.g. 2007 refers to 2006-07 financial year). Treatment: 2003 refers to household waste only. Other recovery: refers to energy recovery from the collection of methane generated from the anaerobic decay of organic waste in large landfills (this is commonly used to generate electricity for sale into the grid). These values are not included in the category 'Amounts designated for recovery operations', but are included in the category 'Amounts designated for disposal operations'/’Landfill’. The methane from landfill gases is used for electricity generation. However the waste itself is not recovered and it remains in the landfill. Quantities of waste recovered via landfill gas are estimated from assumed compositions and methane generation rates. For detail, see the National Waste and Resource Recovery Report 2024. For more details see: https://www.dcceew.gov.au/environment/protection/waste/pu blications/national-waste-reports National Waste and Resource Recovery Report 2024 and associated National Waste Database 2024 and National Waste Reporting Tool 2022-23. Australie Déchets municipaux: En 2000 les données font référence à la fin des années 1990. 1980 fait référence à 1978, estimation incluant des déchets industriels et commerciaux. Les données se réfèrent aux années fiscales (par ex. 2007 fait référence à l’année fiscale 2006-07). Traitement: 2003 fait référence aux déchets des ménages uniquement. Autre récupération: fait référence à la récupération d’énergie de la collecte de méthane produite à partir de la digestion anaérobique de déchets organiques dans les grandes décharges (communément utilisé pour produire de l’électricité, vendue dans le réseau électrique). Ces valeurs ne sont pas incluses dans la catégorie « Montants destinés aux opérations de valorisation » mais sont incluses dans la catégorie « Montants destinés aux opérations d'élimination » / « Mise en décharge » Le méthane des gaz de décharge est utilisé pour la production d'électricité. Cependant, les déchets eux-mêmes ne sont pas récupérés et restent dans la décharge. Les quantités de déchets récupérés via le gaz d'enfouissement sont estimées à partir de compositions et de taux de production de méthane supposés. Pour plus de détails, voir le National Waste and Resource Recovery Report 2024. Pour plus de détails, consultez: https://www.dcceew.gov.au/environment/protection/waste/publicatio ns/national-waste-reports Rapport national sur la récupération des déchets et des ressources 2024 et base de données nationale sur les déchets 2024 associée ainsi que l'outil national de déclaration des déchets 2022-23. Austria Data refer to amounts generated, originating from households, commerce and trade, small businesses, office buildings, institutions and municipal services, i.e. street and market cleaning, yard waste, litter containers, green waste from garden and park or from road maintenance, kitchen- and canteen waste and churchyard waste. Bulk waste is included. Only packaging from households and similar packaging is included. Export of municipal waste or separately collected fractions is mainly taking place in regions (e.g. Vorarlberg, Tirol), where the distance to other Member States is shorter than to Austrian disposal facilities. As Austria has treatment facilities only for lead acid batteries. All other types of waste batteries are exported. Autriche Les données se réfèrent aux quantités générées, provenant des ménages, du commerce et de l'artisanat, des petites entreprises, des immeubles de bureaux, des institutions et des services municipaux, c'est-à-dire le nettoyage des rues et des marchés, les déchets de jardin, les conteneurs à déchets, les déchets verts provenant des jardins et des parcs ou de l'entretien des routes, les déchets de cuisine et de cantine et les déchets du cimetière. Les encombrants sont inclus. Seuls les emballages ménagers et les emballages similaires sont inclus. L'exportation de déchets municipaux ou de fractions collectées séparément a lieu principalement dans des régions (par exemple Vorarlberg, Tirol), où la distance vers d'autres États membres est plus courte que vers les installations d'élimination autrichiennes. L'Autriche ne dispose d'installations de traitement que pour les accumulateurs au plomb. Tous les autres types de déchets de batteries sont exportés. 8  Until 2003, figures for recovery and disposal include secondary waste (particularly landfill). From 2004, the figures for recovery and disposal do not contain double counts anymore. Break in series in 2020 due to a change in methodology: from 2020 data contains also municipal waste from all other sources than households, not collected by the municipal waste collection system, thus increasing the amount of waste generated and treated. For more information see: www.budesabfallwirtschaftsplan.at Jusqu'en 2003, les chiffres concernant la valorisation et l'élimination comprennent les déchets secondaires (en particulier la mise en décharge). À partir de 2004, les chiffres de la valorisation et de l'élimination ne contiennent plus de doubles comptes. Rupture de série en 2020 en raison d'un changement de méthodologie : à partir de 2020, les données contiennent également les déchets municipaux provenant de toutes les sources autres que les ménages, non collectés par le système de collecte des déchets municipaux, ce qui augmente la quantité de déchets produits et traités. Pour plus d’information voir: www.bundesabfallwirtschaftsplan.at Belgium Data refer to amounts collected, including waste from small enterprises, offices, institutions, restaurants, municipal services (street cleaning etc.) and bulky waste. In 2016, the Walloon region changed its methodology. Waste going to pre-treatment is not anymore automatically considered as recycled, but all waste flows are being traced up to their final destination or estimated loss rates applied (15% for metals, plastic and beverage cartons, no loss for paper and cardboard). The change in methodology was applied to all data from 2008. For plastic, metal and beverage cartons the assumption is that 85% are recycled and the rest (15%) incinerated (incineration with recovery of energy or simple incineration, depending on the destination). The tracing of flows was possible only for the period 2008-2015. The change in methodology had an impact on the final quantities of waste in each waste management operation for the period 2008-2015, and data for previous years (till 2007) is therefore not any more considered as valid by the Walloon administration. The drop (break in series) in “other recovery” between 2019 and 2020 is due to a change in methodology to measure the amount of metal and inert materials recycled in a mechanical-biological treatment facility in the Flanders Landfill: 1980 include residues from incineration. For more information see: www.statbel.be www.ovam.be www.leefmiliebrussel.be www.environnement.wallonie.be Belgique Les données se réfèrent aux quantités collectées, incluant les déchets des petites entreprises, bureaux, institutions, restaurants, services municipaux (nettoyage des rues etc.) et les encombrants. En 2016, la Région wallonne a changé de méthodologie. Les déchets soumis à un prétraitement ne sont plus automatiquement considérés comme recyclés, mais tous les flux de déchets sont tracés jusqu'à leur destination finale ou des taux de perte estimés sont appliqués (15 % pour les métaux, le plastique et les cartons de boissons, aucune perte pour le papier et le carton). Le changement de méthodologie a été appliqué à toutes les données à partir de 2008. Pour le plastique, le métal et les cartons à boissons, l'hypothèse est que 85% sont recyclés et le reste (15%) incinéré (incinération avec récupération d'énergie ou incinération simple, selon la destination). Le traçage des flux n'a été possible que pour la période 2008-2015. Le changement de méthodologie a eu un impact sur les quantités finales de déchets dans chaque opération de gestion des déchets pour la période 2008-2015, et les données des années précédentes (jusqu'en 2007) ne sont donc plus considérées comme valables par l'administration wallonne. La baisse (rupture de série) de la rubrique \"autre valorisation\" entre 2019 et 2020 est due à un changement de méthodologie pour mesurer la quantité de métaux et de matériaux inertes recyclés dans une installation de traitement mécanique-biologique en Flandre. Mise en décharge: 1980 inclut les résidus de l’incinération.

Treatment: residential and non-residential sources, include industrial waste, and as of 2000 include demolition and construction waste. In 2018, total diversion includes certain materials that were not included in the source (residential and non-residential) diversion totals. Canada Déchets municipaux: en 2002, 27 millions de tonnes de déchets non dangereux étaient produits par les ménages, institutions, établissements commerciaux et industries (sans les déchets de construction et de démolition).

Chile 2014: change in methodology (enter into force of the National Waste Declaration System). Before 2014, data refer to amounts going to landfill only. Other recovery includes pre-treatment, preparation for reuse and vermiculture. 2018 data contains estimations for 45 (out of 345) municipalities that did not report their municipal waste generation, assuming that all waste was landfilled. For more information: https://datosretc.mma.gob.cl/group Chili 2014: changement de méthodologie (entrée en vigueur du Système National de Déclaration des Déchets). Avant 2014, les données font référence aux quantités mises en décharge uniquement. Autre récupération inclut le prétraitement, la préparation pour réutilisation et la vermiculture. Les données 2018 contiennent des estimations pour 45 (de 345) communes qui n’ont pas fourni de données sur les déchets municipaux, en supposant que la totalité des déchets a été mise en décharge.

Costa Rica Data refers to amounts collected from households, commerce and trade, small businesses, office buildings, institutions, and from municipal services. Waste is collected by municipal services and private contractors. Data also includes waste not collected and disposed in uncontrolled sites. Waste originates from the residential sector, commercial activities, services, industries, street cleaning and public areas. Recovery operations: cover ordinary waste treated and that is not deposited in private landfills or municipal landfills. Landfill: Ordinary waste that is deposited in private and municipal landfills and municipal landfills. Other disposal: disposal of ordinary waste in uncontrolled sites, i.e. those not collected by private actors or Costa Rica Les données font référence aux déchets municipaux collectés des ménages et les déchets similaires des entreprises (usines, bureaux, secteur des commerces et des services), collectés par les services municipaux et les prestataires privés de collecte des déchets. Les données incluent également les déchets non collectés et éliminés dans des sites non-contrôlés. Les déchets proviennent du secteur résidentiel, commerciale, des services, des industries, du nettoyage des routes and des espaces publics. Opérations de récupération : couvrent les déchets ordinaires traités et qui ne sont pas déposés dans les décharges privées ou municipales. Mise en décharge: Déchets ordinaires qui sont déposés dans des décharges privées, municipales et communales. Autre élimination : élimination de déchets dans des sites non contrôlés, par exemple qui ne sont pas collectés par les privés ou les 10  municipalities and burned or buried in houses and shops or thrown into vacant lots, rivers, streams, roadsides, etc. Incineration with energy recovery: the large fluctuations in 2016-21 are due to varying economic costs (fees, charges, transport costs) of (private) waste recovery plants with respect to landfilling. municipalités et brûlés ou enterrés dans les maisons et les magasins ou jetés dans des terrains vagues, des rivières, des ruisseaux, des bords de route, etc. Incinération avec valorisation énergétique : les fortes fluctuations en 2016-21 sont dues à la variation des coûts économiques (frais, charges, coûts de transport) des installations (privées) de valorisation des déchets par rapport à la mise en décharge. Czechia Municipal waste: before 2000, incomplete estimates from the pilot phase of waste survey. Break in series due to changes in methodology in 2004 and 2017. Treatment: includes amounts undergoing mechanical sorting before treatment/disposal. From 2001 until 2009, higher amounts for waste generated than for total treatment are due to storage balance and exports/imports. Tchéquie Déchets municipaux: jusqu’en 2000, estimations incomplètes de la phase pilote de l'enquête sur les déchets. Rupture de série due à des changements de méthodologie en 2004 et 2017. Traitement: inclut le tri mécanique avant traitement/élimination. De 2001 à 2009, le montant des déchets produits est supérieur au montant des déchets traités en raison du stockage et des exportations/importations. Denmark Data refers to amounts generated, including waste from small enterprises, offices, institutions, restaurants, municipal services (street cleaning etc.), bulky waste and electronic waste. The share of waste from households is estimated at 68%. In 2011 implementation of the new Waste Data System based on the European List of Waste. Municipal waste: 1980, 1985 data refer to surveying methods at the generators of waste. Waste from households: domestic waste, bulky waste, garden waste, packaging waste and other, in Danish classification. Landfill: ban on landfilling of waste suitable for incineration since 1st January 1997.

La part des déchets ménagers est estimée à 68%. En 2011 mise en œuvre du nouveau Système de Données des Déchets basé sur la Liste Européenne des Déchets. Déchets municipaux: les données 1980 et 1985 proviennent d’enquêtes auprès des producteurs. Déchets des ménages: déchets domestiques, encombrants, déchets des jardins, d’emballages et autres, d’après la classification danoise. Mise en décharge: interdiction de mise en décharge des déchets pouvant être incinérés depuis le 1er Janvier 1997.

Share of packaging waste collected from households: paper and cardboard 70%; plastic 70%; wood 5%; metal 40%; glass 100%. The separate collection of household packaging waste started in 2005 and was included in the municipal waste data for the first time in 2014. Estonie Les données se réfèrent aux quantités générées, incluant les déchets des petites entreprises, bureaux, institutions, restaurants, services municipaux (nettoyage des rues etc.), les encombrants et les déchets électroniques. Part des déchets d'emballages collectés auprès des ménages : papier et carton 70% ; plastique 70% ; bois 5% ; métal 40% ; verre 100%. La collecte séparée des déchets d'emballages ménagers a commencé en 2005 et a été incluse dans les données sur les déchets municipaux pour la première fois en 2014.  11 OECD, ENVIRONMENT STATISTICS DATABASE Municipal waste: for the years 1995 to 1999 the figures refer to the amount of municipal waste collected. From 1995 to 1999 municipal waste collection covered about 70% of the population, from 2000 to 2008 about 79%, in 2009 and 2010 about 90% and about 95% since 2011. Before 2011, data include some construction waste and before 2014 they also include waste from on-site effluent treatment. The break in time series for 2010 is due to changes in the municipal waste composition. Up to 2009, large quantities of soil and stones generated in construction, and sludges from on-site effluent treatment (20 03 04) were. included in the municipal waste. Since 2010, the misclassified waste streams were reclassified and the data quality increased significantly. Since 2014, soil and stones as well as sludges from on-site effluent treatment are not included any more. The break in 2014 is due to inclusion of packaging wastes (not included until 2013). Other reasons for the higher waste generation 2014 are the increases of mixed municipal waste generation and also the increase of separate collection in bigger towns. Waste from households: change in methodology in 2014. Can include waste separately collected from small enterprises. Treatment: As of 2012, amounts treated refer to waste actually treated during the reference year, and do not necessarily refer to amounts generated during the same year (due to amounts stored temporarily for treatment in the following year). Recycling: may include some waste undergoing a pretreatment before being recycled (e.g. metal waste); exclude paper and cardboard waste, and bulky waste recovered. Since 2014, data coverage has been expanded to include packaging waste from households. Other recovery: includes pre-treatment of some waste (repacking of hazardous municipal waste) and the recovery of mineral parts (for example sand, stones) from MBT treatment process for closure of landfills or backfilling. The drop in 2019 is due to the fact that a facility used waste to create an intermediate layer in a landfill; since 2019 this has been forbidden. For more information see: http://www.stat.ee/en https://www.keskkonnaagentuur.ee/en/goals-activities/waste https://jats.keskkonnainfo.ee/main.php?lang=en&public=1 Déchets municipaux: de 1995 à 1999, quantités de déchets collectés. De 1995 à 1999 la collecte municipale des déchets couvrait environ 70% de la population, de 2000 à 2008 environ 79%, environ 90% en 2009 et 2010, et environ 95% depuis 2011. Avant 2011 les données incluent des déchets de construction et avant 2014 elles incluent aussi des boues provenant du traitement in-situ des effluents. La rupture dans les séries chronologiques pour 2010 est due à des changements dans la composition des déchets municipaux. Jusqu'en 2009, les déchets municipaux comprenaient de grandes quantités de terre et de pierres générées par la construction, ainsi que des boues provenant du traitement des effluents sur site (20 03 04). Depuis 2010, les flux de déchets mal classés ont été reclassés et la qualité des données s'est considérablement améliorée. Depuis 2014, la terre et les pierres ainsi que les boues provenant du traitement des effluents sur site ne sont plus incluses. La rupture en 2014 est due à l'inclusion des déchets d'emballages (non inclus jusqu'en 2013). L'augmentation de la production de déchets en 2014 s'explique également par l'augmentation de la production de déchets municipaux mixtes et par l'augmentation de la collecte séparée dans les grandes villes. Déchets des ménages: changement de méthodologie en 2014. Peut inclure des déchets des petites entreprises dans la collecte séparative. Traitement: à partir de 2012 les quantités traitées font référence aux quantités effectivement traitées durant l’année de référence, et ne se réfèrent pas nécessairement aux quantités produites durant cette même année (dû au stockage temporaire quantités, traitées l’année suivante). Recyclage: peut inclure des déchets ayant subi un traitement préalable au recyclage (par ex. déchets métalliques) ; exclut les déchets de carton et papier, et les déchets encombrants recyclés. Depuis 2014, la couverture des données a été élargie pour inclure les déchets d’emballage des ménages. Autre récupération: inclut le prétraitement de certain déchets (reconditionnement des déchets municipaux dangereux) et la récupération de fractions minérales (par exemple du sable, des pierres), emmagasinées dans le processus de traitement mécanique et biologique (MBT), pour la fermeture de décharges ou pour le remblayage. La baisse en 2019 est due au fait qu'une installation utilisait des déchets pour créer une couche intermédiaire dans une décharge ; depuis 2019, cela est interdit.

The treatment is derived from a survey of treatment facilities, while before it was based on the survey with collectors who indicated to which treatment the waste was sent. Data refers to amounts collected, including waste from small enterprises, offices, institutions, restaurants, municipal services (street cleaning etc.) and bulky waste. The share of waste from households is estimated at 82% in 2022. Recycling: as of 2010, recycling figures refer to output from sorting facilities. Until 2009, input to sorting facilities was reported (incl. sorting residues). Municipal waste generated per capita: break in series in 2014 due to the inclusion of the population of Mayotte (not included for earlier years) France Rupture de série en 2016, changement complet de méthodologie: le champ est plus large, il inclut les déchets collectés en dehors du service public. Le traitement est issu d'une enquête auprès des installations de traitement, alors qu'auparavant il était basé sur l'enquête auprès des collecteurs qui indiquaient vers quel traitement les déchets étaient envoyés. Les données se réfèrent aux quantités collectées, incluant les déchets des petites entreprises, bureaux, institutions, restaurants, services municipaux (nettoyage des rues etc.) et les encombrants. La part des déchets ménagers est estimée à 82% en 2022. Recyclage: à partir de 2010 les données font références aux flux sortant des installations de tri. Jusqu’en 2009 les données font référence aux flux entrant dans les installations de tri (et donc inclut les résidus de tri). Déchets municipaux produits par habitant : rupture de série en 2014 en raison de l'inclusion de la population de Mayotte (non incluse pour les années précédentes). Germany Data refers to amounts generated, including waste from small enterprises, offices, institutions, restaurants, municipal services (street cleaning etc.) and bulky waste. All packaging waste (waste group 1501) is assigned to municipal waste. Municipal waste: from 2000 waste according to the European Waste Catalogue. Waste from households: household and similar waste collected publicly with household waste, bulky, compostable waste from biocontainers, separate collection, and since 2002 biodegradable garden and park waste. Treatment: 1995-2001 include OECD estimates for light packaging plastic waste and other waste previously excluded from the definition. Landfill: ban on landfilling of organic waste since 1 June 2005. Particularly high landfilling amounts in 2021 are mostly due to Ahr Valley flooding which happened on 15 July 2021. Other disposal: mostly refers to mechanical-biological treatment (MBT). 2022 data is provisional and contains estimates. Allemagne Les données se réfèrent aux quantités générées, incluant les déchets des petites entreprises, bureaux, institutions, restaurants, services municipaux (nettoyage des rues etc.) et les encombrants. Tous les déchets d'emballage (groupe de déchets 1501) sont classés comme déchets municipaux. Déchets municipaux: à partir de 2000, déchets définis selon le catalogue européen des déchets. Déchets des ménages: déchets des ménages et similaires collectés publiquement avec les déchets des ménages, encombrants, déchets compostables des conteneurs bio, collecte séparative, et depuis 2002 les déchets biodégradables des jardins et des parcs. Traitement: 1995-2001, inclut des estimations de l’OCDE pour les emballages plastique légers et les autres déchets, qui étaient exclu de la définition. Mise en décharge: interdiction de la mise en décharge des déchets organiques à partir du 1er juin 2005. La valeur de mise en décharge particulièrement élevée en 2021 est principalement due aux inondations de la vallée de l'Ahr qui se sont produites le 15 juillet 2021. Autre élimination: fait principalement référence au traitement mécanico-biologique (MBT) Les données de 2022 sont provisoires et contiennent des estimations.  13 OECD, ENVIRONMENT STATISTICS DATABASE 2020-21 data on aggregate recovery does not include \"preparing for reuse\" quantities, and the sum of the subcomponents does not equal the aggregate.

By the end of 2004, a new establishment was in operation and another one started in 2005. Break in series for composting in 2020. Prior to 2019 the composting figures included: (a) estimates used for home composting and biodegradable waste produced in rural areas and recovered through their use in farming and animal husbandry – these are not reported from 2020. (b) output from the mechanical treatment and at the same time input (organic fraction) of the biological treatment of the MBT facilities. Since 2020 the reported composting figures refer only to separately collected biowaste entering biowaste treatment facilities, following the methodology outlined in the Annex II of the EU Implementing Decision 2019/1004. Landfill: as of 2010, include amounts previously sent to uncontrolled dumping areas that were closed in 2009. Grèce Compostage: les données 1997-2002 font référence à la capacité de la seule unité opérationnelle. Cette unité était en cours de révision depuis 2003 (jusqu’à fin 2009). Une nouvelle unité a été opérationnelle fin 2004 et une autre a commencé à l’être en 2005. Rupture de série pour le compostage en 2020. Avant 2019, les chiffres du compostage comprenaient : (a) les estimations utilisées pour le compostage domestique et les déchets biodégradables produits dans les zones rurales et récupérés grâce à leur utilisation dans l'agriculture et l'élevage – elles ne sont pas communiquées à partir de 2020. (b) la production du traitement mécanique et en même temps l'apport (fraction organique) du traitement biologique des installations MBT. Depuis 2020, les chiffres de compostage déclarés se réfèrent uniquement aux biodéchets collectés séparément entrant dans les installations de traitement des biodéchets, conformément à la méthodologie décrite dans l'annexe II de la décision d'exécution de l'UE 2019/1004. Mise en décharge: à partir de 2010, inclut des quantités précédemment envoyées dans des zones de décharge non contrôlées et qui ont été fermées en 2009. Hungary Data refers to collected amounts, which include exports of waste but not imports, and including waste from small enterprises, offices, institutions, restaurants (around 17%), and bulky waste (around 5%). From 2000, improved data quality due to weighing of the waste amounts at the treatment sites. Municipal waste: includes estimates for population not served by municipal waste services until 2013. As of 2013, 100% of the population is served by municipal waste services. Waste from household: before 2005 collected waste only. Recycling: since 2007 include waste exported for recycling (2007: 30%; 2008: 25%; 2009: 34%; 2010: 50%; 2011: 53%; 2012: 19%; 2013: 30%; 2014: 12%; 2015: 19%; 2016: 29%; 2017: 33%; 2018: 37%). Incineration: 2004 smaller amounts due to the reconstruction of the largest incinerator. Hongrie Les données se réfèrent aux quantités collectées, qui incluent les exportations de déchets mais pas les importations, et comprenant les déchets des petites entreprises, des bureaux, des institutions, des restaurants (environ 17%), et les encombrants (environ 5%). À partir de 2000, amélioration de la qualité des données grâce à la pesée des quantités de déchets sur les sites de traitement. Déchets municipaux: incluent des estimations pour la population non desservie par un service municipal des déchets jusqu’en 2013. À partir de 2013, 100% de la population est desservie par un service municipal des déchets. Déchets des ménages: avant 2005, déchets collectés uniquement. Recyclage: à partir de 2007 inclut les déchets exportés pour recyclage (2007: 30%; 2008: 25%; 2009: 34%; 2010: 50%; 2011: 53%; 2012: 19%; 2013: 30%; 2014: 12%; 2015: 19%; 2016: 29%; 2017: 33%; 2018: 37%). Incinération: montants faibles en 2004 dû à la reconstruction du plus grand incinérateur. 14  Landfill: excludes residues from other operations that were included until 2003 (54 000 t. in 2003). Mise en décharge: exclut les résidus d'autres opérations qui étaient inclus jusqu’en 2003 (54 000 t. en 2003). Iceland Composting: Significant changes occurred in composting and \"Other recovery\" for Iceland for 2021 data due to the largest waste handler starting a composting plant in 2020, with operations fully commencing in 2022/23 after initial testing. However, complications in installation led to a shift towards higher biogas production in 2021, prompting the classification of waste processed for biogas as 'other recovery' instead of composting. Islande Compostage: Des changements importants sont intervenus dans le domaine du compostage et des \"autre récupération\" en Islande pour les données de 2021, en raison de la mise en service d'une usine de compostage par le plus grand gestionnaire de déchets en 2020, l'exploitation ayant pleinement débuté en 2022/23 après des essais initiaux. Toutefois, des complications liées à l'installation ont entraîné une augmentation de la production de biogaz en 2021, ce qui a conduit à classer les déchets traités pour la production de biogaz dans la catégorie \"autre récupération\" plutôt que dans la catégorie \"compostage\". Ireland Municipal waste: change in methodology in 2003. Waste from household: includes estimates arising from household not served by waste collection. Change in methodology in 2002. Incineration: from 2008 to 2010, the value on incineration (R1 activity) consists of co-incineration as refuse derived fuel (RDF), but also use of wood as a fuel and use of edible oils and fats in biodiesel processing rather than merchant municipal waste incineration (which did not commence until October 2011). The increase in 2014 is due to the commissioning of a new municipal waste operator. Treatment: include tonnages treated in the State and exported for treatment. Other recovery: refers to biostabilised organic fines (generated by municipal waste facilities) used as landfill cover (backfilling operation). The amount recycled plus composted and digested may be higher than the corresponding amount separately collected due to biowaste composted at source which is counted as composted but not as separately collected. Irelande Déchets municipaux: changement de méthodologie en 2003. Déchets des ménages: incluent des estimations pour la population non desservie par un service municipal des déchets. Incinération: de 2008 à 2010 l’incinération (activité R1) fait référence à la co-incinération de déchets comme combustibles mais également à l’utilisation de bois et d’huiles et de graisses comestibles comme combustibles. L’incinération commerciale des déchets a commencé en octobre 2011). L’augmentation en 2014 est due à la mise en opération d’un nouvel opérateur pour les déchets municipaux. Traitement: inclut des montants traités dans le pays et des montants exportés pour traitement. Autre récupération: fait références à des particules biostabilisées (produites par des installations de gestion des déchets municipaux), utilisées comme couverture dans les décharges (opération de remblayage). La quantité recyclée plus compostée et digérée peut être supérieure à la quantité correspondante collectée séparément en raison des biodéchets compostés à la source qui sont comptabilisés comme compostés mais pas comme collectés séparément. Israel Municipal waste: amounts collected. Amount designated for recovery operations: before 2013 include recycling and composting. Israël Déchets municipaux: quantités collectées. Quantités destinées à des opérations de récupération: avant 2013 inclut le recyclage et le compostage. Italy As of 2016, the new national definition of municipal waste includes small amounts of construction and demolition waste from households in the separate collection. Recycling: Includes waste from sorting operations which are sent to landfill. 2008, change in methodology: until 2007 data Italie À partir de 2016, la nouvelle définition nationale des déchets municipaux inclut des montants peu importants de déchets de construction et démolition des ménages dans la collecte séparative. Recyclage: comprend les déchets provenant du tri des opérations qui sont envoyés à la décharge. 2008, changement de méthodologie: jusqu’en 2007 les données font référence uniquement aux fractions  15 OECD, ENVIRONMENT STATISTICS DATABASE refers to fractions collected on public areas only, as of 2008 all fractions sent for recycling are taken into account. Composting: From 2005 composting includes anaerobic treatments. Incineration with energy recovery: includes waste sent to industrial plants to produce energy (cement plants). Implementation of the energy efficiency criteria in 2015 in accordance with the Directive 2008/98/EC. Incineration: since 2002 cover both urban waste and waste-derived fuels and are not comparable with previous years due to change of methodology. Implementation of the energy efficiency criteria in 2015 in accordance with the Directive 2008/98/EC. Other recovery: home composting. collectées dans les espaces publiques, à partir de 2008 toutes les quantités recyclées sont prises en compte. Compostage: A partir de 2005 le compostage inclut le traitement anaérobique. Incinération avec récupération d’énergie: inclut les déchets envoyés aux installations industrielles pour produire de l'énergie (cimenteries). Mise en œuvre du critère d’efficacité énergétique en 2015 (en accord avec la directive 2008/98/EC). Incinération: à partir de 2002 les données couvrent les déchets urbains et les carburants produits à partir de déchets, et ne sont pas comparables avec les années précédentes dues à un changement de méthodologie. Mise en œuvre du critère d’efficacité énergétique en 2015 (en accord avec la directive 2008/98/EC). Autre récupération: compostage domestique Japan Some of the disposals included in \"recycling\" were classified as \"Other disposal\", so the amount of recycling seems to have decreased in 2019. Recycling: amounts directly recycled (including private collection) and recovered from intermediate processing. Composting: refers to processing into feeding, methanisation and composting. Landfill: direct disposal excluding residues from other treatments (4 million tonnes in 2016). Other recovery: intermediate treatment less resource recovery from intermediate processing. Japon Certaines des éliminations incluses dans le \" recyclage \" ont été classées dans la catégorie \" Autres éliminations \", de sorte que le montant du recyclage semble avoir diminué en 2019. Recyclage: quantités recyclées directement (y compris la collecte privée) et récupérées après traitement intermédiaire. Compostage: fait référence à la transformation en alimentation, à la méthanisation et au compostage. Mise en décharge: élimination directe (excl. les résidus des autres traitements, 4 millions de t. en 2016). Autre valorisation : traitement intermédiaire moins la valorisation des ressources issues du traitement intermédiaire 16  Latvia Data refers to amounts collected, including waste from small enterprises, offices, institutions, restaurants, municipal services (street cleaning etc.), and bulky waste. Definition of municipal waste: unsorted waste and separately collected waste from households, including paper and board, glass, metals, plastics, bio-waste, wood, textiles, packaging, waste electrical and electronic equipment, waste batteries and accumulators, large waste, including mattresses and furniture, as well as unsorted waste and separately collected waste from other sources, the properties and composition of which are similar to household waste. Waste from production, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, septic tanks and sewage treatment and treatment, including sewage sludge, end-of-life vehicles or construction and demolition waste shall not be considered as municipal waste. Municipal waste: The break in the time series in 2002 is due to the use of a new data source. The decrease between 1995- 98 is due to a decline of the population and the economic activity (GDP) over the period. The larger differences between waste generated and treated in 2011 are due to inconsistencies in wastes reports, and to temporary storage and partly also to material treatment for more recent years.

Définition des déchets municipaux : déchets non triés et déchets ménagers collectés séparément, y compris le papier et le carton, le verre, les métaux, les plastiques, les biodéchets, le bois, les textiles, les emballages, les déchets d'équipements électriques et électroniques, les déchets de piles et d'accumulateurs, les grands déchets, y compris les matelas et les meubles, ainsi que les déchets non triés et les déchets d'autres sources collectés séparément, dont les propriétés et la composition sont similaires à celles des déchets ménagers. Les déchets provenant de la production, de l'agriculture, de la sylviculture, de la pêche, des fosses septiques et du traitement des eaux usées, y compris les boues d'épuration, les véhicules hors d'usage ou les déchets de construction et de démolition ne sont pas considérés comme des déchets municipaux. Déchets municipaux: La rupture de série en 2002 est due à l'utilisation d'une nouvelle source de données.. La baisse en 1995-98 est due à une baisse de la population et de l’activité économique (PIB) sur la période. Les différences plus importantes entre les déchets produits et traités en 2011 sont dues à des incohérences dans les rapports sur les déchets, ainsi qu'au stockage temporaire et en partie aussi au traitement des matériaux pour les années plus récentes. Pour plus d’information, voir: https://videscentrs.lvgmc.lv/lapas/atkritumi-un-radiacijas-objekti Lithuania Data refers to amounts collected, including waste from small enterprises, offices, institutions, restaurants, municipal services (street cleaning etc.), and bulky waste. The share of waste from households is estimated at 70%. Imported waste is excluded. Exported waste mainly consists of secondary raw material to be recycled. Thus exported waste is counted as recycled waste. From 1999, the decrease in the amount of waste can be explained by modernisation of treatment sites; waste is now weighed, while previously its weight was estimated based on its volume. In 2016 the first waste incineration plant was put into operation and additional 2 in 2019-2020. Therefore since then we observe a decrease in waste landfilled amounts (including composted in MBT plants) and an increase in waste incineration. For more information, see: http://gamta.lt/ http://www.stat.gov.lt/ http://am.lrv.lt/ Lithuanie Les données se réfèrent aux quantités collectées, incluant les déchets des petites entreprises, bureaux, institutions, restaurants, services municipaux (nettoyage des rues etc.), et les encombrants. La part des déchets ménagers est estimée à 70%. Les déchets importés sont exclus. Les déchets exportés sont principalement constitués de matières secondaires destinées à être recyclées. Les déchets exportés sont donc comptés comme des déchets recyclés. À partir de 1999, la diminution de la quantité de déchets s'explique par la modernisation des sites de traitement ; les déchets sont désormais pesés, alors qu'auparavant leur poids était estimé en fonction de leur volume. En 2016, la première usine d'incinération des déchets a été mise en service et deux autres en 2019-2020. Depuis lors, on observe donc une diminution des quantités de déchets mis en décharge (y compris ceux compostés dans les usines MBT) et une augmentation de l'incinération des déchets.

Prior to 2020, the definition was based on the responsibility of municipalities. Since 2020, the definition has been based solely on waste codes, without taking into account the origin of the waste. This change resulted in more waste being included in the statistics. To compare data from before and after 2020, the total amount of waste generated by households should be used. Since 2016, more waste similar to household waste from non-household sources is included in municipal waste statistics. Data refers to amounts collected, including waste from small enterprises, offices, institutions, restaurants, municipal services (street cleaning etc.), and bulky waste. Municipal waste: 1995 onwards includes separate collection. Composting: corresponds to organic waste - biological waste and garden waste - going to biogas installations. All packaging waste (excluding wood) is considered as municipal waste. Compostite packaging is reported as 150106 (mixed waste) under waste generated. For the recyling rate it is assumed that 50% of this waste is paper/cardboard and 50% plastic. About 25% of the generated residual municipal waste is send to a MBT. The fraction of mechanical screening is sent to an incineration plant and the output of the biological treatment goes to landfill. The amounts of waste going to landfill is however measured before biological treatment and is hence based on input (rotting losses are not considered). For more information, see: https://data.public.lu/fr/datasets/environnement-dechets/ https://environnement.public.lu/fr/offall-ressourcen/types-dedechets.html http://www.statistiques.public.lu/stat/ReportFolders/ReportFo lder.aspx?IF_Language=fra&MainTheme=1&FldrName=3&R FPath=65 Luxembourg Rupture de série en 2020 : changement de la définition des déchets municipaux. Avant 2020, la définition était basée sur la responsabilité des municipalités. Depuis 2020, la définition se base uniquement sur les codes de déchets, sans tenir compte de l'origine des déchets. Ce changement a entraîné l'inclusion d'un plus grand nombre de déchets dans les statistiques. Pour comparer les données d'avant et d'après 2020, il convient d'utiliser la quantité totale de déchets produits par les ménages. Depuis 2016, davantage de déchets similaires aux déchets ménagers provenant de sources non ménagères sont inclus dans les statistiques sur les déchets municipaux. Les données se réfèrent aux quantités collectées, incluant les déchets des petites entreprises, bureaux, institutions, restaurants, services municipaux (nettoyage des rues etc.), et les encombrants. Déchets municipaux: à partir de 1995 incluent la collecte séparative. Compostage: correspond aux déchets organiques – déchets biologiques et déchets de jardins – destinés aux installations de production biogaz. Tous les déchets d'emballage (à l'exception du bois) sont considérés comme des déchets municipaux. Les emballages en compost sont déclarés sous le numéro 150106 (déchets mélangés) dans la rubrique des déchets produits. Pour le taux de recyclage, on suppose que 50 % de ces déchets sont constitués de papier/carton et 50 % de plastique. Environ 25 % des déchets municipaux résiduels produits sont envoyés à un centre de tri. La fraction du criblage mécanique est envoyée à une usine d'incinération et le produit du traitement biologique est mis en décharge. La quantité de déchets mis en décharge est toutefois mesurée avant le traitement biologique et est donc basée sur les entrées (les pertes dues à la pourriture ne sont pas prises en compte). Pour plus d’information, voir: https://data.public.lu/fr/datasets/environnement-dechets/ https://environnement.public.lu/fr/offall-ressourcen/types-dedechets.html http://www.statistiques.public.lu/stat/ReportFolders/ReportFolder.asp x?IF_Language=fra&MainTheme=1&FldrName=3&RFPath=65 Korea National definition of municipal waste: wastes other than business site waste under the Waste Control Act: waste which is neither from business sites with a waste discharging facility installed and in operation in accordance with the Clean Air Conservation Act, the Water Quality and Aquatic Ecosystem Conservation Act and the Noise and Vibration Control Act, nor being discharged with more than a daily average of 300kg, etc. Data refers to amount of waste collected from households, from commerce and trade, small businesses, Corée Définition nationale des déchets municipaux : déchets autres que les déchets de sites d'entreprises au sens de la loi sur le contrôle des déchets : déchets qui ne proviennent pas de sites d'entreprises dotés d'une installation de décharge de déchets installée et en service conformément à la loi sur la conservation de l'air pur, la loi sur la qualité de l'eau et la conservation des écosystèmes aquatiques et la loi sur le contrôle du bruit et des vibrations, et qui ne sont pas déchargés avec plus de 300 kg en moyenne par jour, etc. Les données se réfèrent à la quantité de déchets collectés auprès des 18  office buildings, institutions, and from municipal services, i.e street and market cleaning, yard waste, litter containers. Recycling: the amount of recycling has increased continuously thanks to the implementation of policies to expand the recycling of wastes and to strengthen the criteria of incineration facility management. From 2019, intermediate disposal (except the incineration) included in recycling is classified as 'other disposal', due to a change in the waste regulation. The amount of waste is increasing due to economic growth. The landfill rate is decreasing and the incineration rate is increasing due to a policy on banning direct landfill. The direct landfill ban policy will be implemented from 2026 in the metropolitan area and from 2030 in other areas. For more information: http://stat.me.go.kr ménages, du commerce et de l'artisanat, des petites entreprises, des immeubles de bureaux, des institutions et des services municipaux (nettoyage des rues et des marchés, déchets de jardin, conteneurs à déchets). Recyclage: le volume de recyclage n'a cessé d'augmenter grâce à la mise en œuvre de politiques visant à développer le recyclage des déchets et à renforcer les critères de gestion des installations d'incinération. À partir de 2019, l'élimination intermédiaire (à l'exception de l'incinération) incluse dans le recyclage est classée comme \"autre élimination\", en raison d'un changement dans la réglementation sur les déchets. La quantité de déchets augmente en raison de la croissance économique. Le taux de mise en décharge diminue et le taux d'incinération augmente en raison d'une politique d'interdiction de la mise en décharge directe. La politique d'interdiction de la mise en décharge directe sera mise en œuvre à partir de 2026 dans la zone métropolitaine et à partir de 2030 dans les autres zones. Pour plus d’information: http://stat.me.go.kr Mexico Landfill: includes engineered landfill, controlled sites (with middle infrastructure and control between engineered and open landfills). Other disposal: landfill without leachate control (3344 thousand tonnes in 2012) and uncontrolled sites (8680 thousand tonnes in 2012). Data refer to amounts generated and includes bulky waste. Until 2012, data are estimates. Data for 2014, 2016, 2018 and 2020 and 2022 were obtained from census data on municipal authorities: for data on the daily average of urban solid waste collected they are a proxy values of the generation, they do not include the waste generate that are not collected. There is no official update of the generation of this type of waste.

Autre élimination: mise en décharge sans contrôle des lixiviats (3344 mille tonnes en 2012) et les sites non contrôlés (86840 en 2012). Les données se réfèrent aux quantités produites et incluent les déchets encombrants. Les données jusqu’en 2012 sont des estimations. Les données pour 2014, 2016, 2018, 2020 et 2022 ont été obtenues à partir des données du recensement des autorités municipales: pour les données sur la moyenne quotidienne des déchets solides urbains collectés, il s'agit de valeurs proxy de la production, elles n'incluent pas les déchets générés qui ne sont pas collectés. Il n'existe pas de mise à jour officielle de la production de ce type de déchets.

Most of the office and services waste is collected by commercial collectors and is not included in the data. The differences between waste generation and treatment until 2007 is waste undergoing preliminary operations like sorting. Pays-Bas Les données se réfèrent aux quantités générées, incluant les services municipaux (nettoyage des rues etc.), et les encombrants. La plupart des déchets de bureau et de services sont collectés par des collecteurs commerciaux et ne sont pas inclus dans les données. Les différences entre la production et le traitement des déchets jusqu'en 2007 est que les déchets étaient soumis à des opérations  19 OECD, ENVIRONMENT STATISTICS DATABASE The break in series in 2008 for treatment variables: data before 2008 is based on the “first applied treatment method” because information on the final treatment is not available. The difference between the reported amount generated and the amount treated is waste treated in MBT/SP. Municipal waste: includes separate collection for recycling purposes. The lower value in 2003 is due to a hot and dry summer resulting in a smaller amount of organic waste. Waste from households: includes waste paper collected by schools, churches, sportclubs. The difference between Municipal waste generation and treatment is waste undergoing preliminary operations like sorting. These amounts range from 6 % (1995) to 17 % (2010) of waste generation. In 2008, the final destination of the pre-treatment output was 11 % landfill, 78 % incineration, 8 % recycling and 3 % losses. Incineration: all incineration plants have energy recovery but before 2008 they do not meet the efficiency target set by the European Waste Framework Directive. Landfill: lower amounts of municipal waste landfilled since 2003 due to new legislation which bans direct disposal of mixed municipal waste to landfill. Packaging waste from businesses is excluded. For more information, see: https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/en/dataset/83558ENG préliminaires comme le tri. La rupture de série en 2008 pour les variables de traitement : les données antérieures à 2008 sont basées sur la \"première méthode de traitement appliquée\" car les informations sur le traitement final ne sont pas disponibles. La différence entre la quantité déclarée et la quantité traitée est le traitement des déchets dans les TMB/SP. Déchets municipaux: incluent la collecte séparative en vue du recyclage. La baisse de 2003 est due à un été chaud et sec qui a résulté en une baisse des quantités de déchets organiques. Déchets des ménages: incluent les déchets de papier collectés par les écoles, les églises et les clubs sportifs. La différence entre les déchets municipaux produits et traités est due aux quantités soumises à des opérations préliminaires telles que le tri mécanique. Ces quantités représentaient 6% du total en 1995 et 17% en 2010. En 2008, la destination finale de ces quantités prétraitées était: 11% mis en décharge, 78% incinérés, 8% recyclés et 3% de pertes. Incinération: toutes les usines d’incinérations récupèrent de l’énergie mais avant 2008 aucune ne remplissait les objectifs d’efficacité fixés par la directive européenne sur les déchets. Mise en décharge: la baisse des quantités mises en décharges à partir de 2003 sont la conséquence d’une nouvelle législation interdisant la mise en décharge des déchets municipaux mixtes. Les déchets d'emballages des entreprises sont exclus. Pour plus d’information, voir: https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/en/dataset/83558ENG New Zealand Municipal waste: data is based on waste disposed of at levied disposal facilities (landfills) in New Zealand. Disposal facilities are facilities that accept household (municipal waste) as defined by the Waste Minimisation Act 2008. The municipal landfills accept various types of waste in addition to municipal waste, such as hazardous waste and construction and demolition waste. The data values until 1995 are based on a national landfill census carried out in those years. The data values for 2006 are based on a national snapshot survey of representative sized landfills across the sector. A national waste levy system was set up in 2009 (which requires a levy on each tonne of waste sent to landfill), leading to more accurate data for municipal waste landfilled. Nouvelle Zélande Déchets municipaux: les données rapportées sont basées sur les déchets éliminés dans les décharges imposées en Nouvelle Zélande. Les décharges acceptent les déchets des ménages tels que définis par le Waste Minimisation Act 2008. Les décharges municipales acceptent différents types de déchets tels que des déchets dangereux ou des déchets de construction et démolition, en plus des déchets municipaux. Jusqu’en 1995 les données sont basées sur des recensements auprès des décharges. Les données 2006 proviennent d’une enquête nationale auprès de décharges d’une taille représentative du secteur. En 2009 un système national de redevance sur les déchets a été mis en place (instaurant une redevance pour chaque tonne de déchet mis en décharge), et a conduit à une amélioration de la précision des données sur les déchets municipaux mis en décharge Norway Breaks in series: older data is not revised. The break in series in 2016 is due to the inclusion of part of waste from the service sector. The break in series in 2020 is because it is the first year when the municipal waste generated by employees in the industry sector have been included. Data refers to amounts collected, including waste from small enterprises, offices, institutions, restaurants, municipal Norvège Ruptures de série : les données plus anciennes ne sont pas révisées. La rupture de série en 2016 est due à l'inclusion d'une partie des déchets du secteur des services. La rupture de série en 2020 est expliqué par le fait que c'est la première année où les déchets municipaux générés par les salariés du secteur industriel ont été inclus. 20  services (street cleaning etc.), and bulky waste. The share of waste from households is estimated at 48% in 2022. Prior to 2001, the figures included all waste collected and handled by municipalities and were not limited to waste similar to household waste, but included also production waste. From 2014, wood waste related to construction and demolition (2013: 255 kt) is no more included in municipal waste generated. Municipal waste: 1990: excludes similar waste from areas not served by municipal waste service and includes a small amount of construction and demolition waste; excludes glass bottles which do not enter the waste stream; from 1992 to 2000: includes production waste and about 90000 tonnes of construction and demolition waste. Large decrease in 2001 is due to review of definition of Municipal Waste. As of 2014, municipal construction and demolition waste are excluded. Municipal waste collection covered 98% of the population in 1995, 99% from 1999 to 2009 and 100% since 2010. Waste from households: excludes scrapped cars which are included in national waste account. Landfill: includes residues from other operations. Other recovery and disposal: treatment of hazardous waste. As of 2022 MBT is not used in Norway.

La part des déchets ménagers est estimée à 48%. Avant 2001, les chiffres comprenaient tous les déchets collectés et traités par les municipalités et ne se limitaient pas aux déchets similaires aux déchets ménagers, mais incluaient également les déchets de production. À partir de 2014, les déchets de bois liés à la construction et à la démolition (2013 : 255 kt) ne sont plus inclus dans les déchets municipaux produits. Déchets municipaux: 1990: excluent les déchets similaires des zones non désservies par un service municipal des déchets et incluent un faible montant de déchets de construction et de démolition ; excluent les bouteilles en verre qui n’entrent pas dans le flux des déchets. De 1992 à 2000: incluent des déchets de production et environ 90000 tonnes de déchets de construction et de démolition. Baisse importante en 2001 due à la révision de la définition des déchets municipaux. À partir de 2014 les déchets municipaux de construction et démolition sont exclus. La collecte municipale de déchets couvrait 98% de la population en 1995, 99% de 1999 à 2009 et 100% depuis 2010. Déchets des ménages: excluent les carcasses de véhicules comprises dans les comptes des déchets nationaux. Mise en décharge: inclut des résidus d’autres opérations. Autre récupération et élimination: traitement des déchets dangereux. Selon l’information de 2022, le MBT n'est pas utilisé en Norvège. Pour plus d’information voir: http://www.ssb.no/en/natur-og-miljo Poland Data refers to amounts collected, including waste from small enterprises, offices, institutions, restaurants, municipal services (street cleaning etc.), and bulky waste. The share of waste from households is estimated at 84.5%. End-of-life vehicles are excluded. Municipal waste: data refer to waste collected until 2005. In 2000 municipal waste collection covered 86% of the population. 1980 and 1985: include liquid waste from cesspool and other containers. Treatment: in 2009 change in the allocation of MBT facilities’ output (used exclusively for recultivation of closed cells of landfill sites, and not for agriculture) from composting to landfilling. In 2011, change in the allocation of MBT facilities’ output between recycling and composting. 2013, change in methodology allowing more details for incineration. Break in series from 2023. Until 2022, municipal waste processing data was estimated using the M-09 Municipal Pologne Les données se réfèrent aux quantités collectées, incluant les déchets des petites entreprises, bureaux, institutions, restaurants, services municipaux (nettoyage des rues etc.), et les encombrants. La part des déchets ménagers est estimée à 84.5%. Les véhicules en fin de vie sont exclus. Déchets municipaux: déchets collectés jusqu’en 2005. En 2000 la collecte municipale de déchets couvrait 86% de la population. 1980 et 1985 incluent des déchets liquides des fosses de curage et autres conteneurs. Traitement: en 2009, changement dans l’allocation des quantités sortant des installations de MBT (utilisées uniquement pour la remise en culture de cellules isolées d’élimination de déchets et non pour l’agriculture) du compostage vers la mise en décharge. En 2011, changement de l’allocation des quantités sortant des installations de MBT, entre recyclage et compostage. 2013, changement de méthodologie permettant d’avoir plus de détails sur l’incinération. Rupture de série à partir de 2023. Jusqu'en 2022, les données relatives au traitement des déchets municipaux étaient estimées à l'aide du  21 OECD, ENVIRONMENT STATISTICS DATABASE Waste Export and Processing Report. From 2023 onward, companies report these data directly in the M-09, eliminating estimates. This shift aligns with changes introduced by the Ministry of Climate and Environment in 2021 to meet EU recycling rate calculation requirements. For more information, see: www.stat.gov.pl rapport M-09 sur l'exportation et le traitement des déchets municipaux. À partir de 2023, les entreprises déclarent ces données directement dans le M-09, éliminant ainsi les estimations. Ce changement s'inscrit dans le cadre des modifications introduites par le ministère du Climat et de l'Environnement en 2021 pour satisfaire aux exigences de l'UE en matière de calcul des taux de recyclage. Pour plus d’information, voir: www.stat.gov.pl Portugal Data include Azores and Madeira Islands. Data refers to amounts collected, including waste from small enterprises, offices, institutions, restaurants, municipal services (street cleaning etc.), and bulky waste. Municipal waste collection covered 95% of the population in 1995, it progressively increased to 100% in 2002. The data sources have been changed through the years. Change in estimation method in 2002. Change in data source in 2007. 2015, change in methodology. Treatment: differences with amounts generated (as of 2015) are due to losses of liquid mass throughout the process of waste management and to differences in accuracy in the weighing of waste throughout the cycle of operation. Recycling: separate collection. Landfill: includes non controlled dumping sites until 2001, when last sites in the country were officially closed and such kind of sites and disposal practice were replaced by controlled landfills managed by inter-municipal waste management services.

Les données se réfèrent aux quantités collectées, incluant les déchets des petites entreprises, bureaux, institutions, restaurants, services municipaux (nettoyage des rues etc.), et les encombrants. La collecte municipale des déchets couvrait 95% de la population en 1995, elle a progressivement augmenté jusqu’à 100% en 2002. 2015, changement de méthodologie. Les sources de données ont été modifiées au fil des ans. Changement de méthode d’estimation en 2002. Changement de source de données en 2007. 2015, changement de méthodologie. Traitement: les différences avec les montants produits (à partir de 2015) sont dues à des pertes de masses liquides durant la gestion des déchets ainsi qu’à des différences de précision dans le pesage des déchets durant le cycle des opérations. Recyclage: collecte séparative. Mise en décharge: inclut les sites non contrôlés jusqu’en 2001 quand les derniers sites du pays ont été officiellement fermés et remplacés par des sites contrôlés, gérés par les services inter-municipaux de gestion des déchets.

Data until 2001 according to national waste catalogue, from 2002 onwards according to the European List of Waste. Municipal waste collection covered 89% of the population in 1995, 96% in 1997 and 100% since 2003. The break in series in 2020 is due to enhancement of methodology for obtaining data on separately collected municipal waste, particularly metals, which resulted from the new waste legislation that has been implemented in 2016. The main improvement is better coverage of metals collected in so called \"collection yards for metal waste\" located in municipalities. République Slovaque Jusqu’en 2000 les données incluent des déchets de fosses de curage (367.2 kt. en 2000). Données jusqu'en 2001 selon le catalogue national des déchets, à partir de 2002 selon la liste européenne des déchets. La collecte municipale des déchets couvrait 89% de la population en 1995, 96% en 1997 et 100% depuis 2003. La rupture de série en 2020 est due à l'amélioration de la méthodologie d'obtention des données sur les déchets municipaux collectés séparément, en particulier les métaux, qui résulte de la nouvelle législation sur les déchets qui a été mise en œuvre en 2016. La principale amélioration est une meilleure couverture des métaux 22  Waste from households: mixed municipal waste and bulky waste. Treatment: in 2005, the data collection system was changed with new R and D codes (according to the EU Waste Framework Directive), causing a loss of information on final recovery of municipal waste, mainly in recycling and less significantly in composting. collectés dans ce que l'on appelle les \"centres de collecte des déchets métalliques\" situés dans les municipalités. Déchets des ménages: déchets municipaux mixtes et encombrants. Traitement: en 2005 le système de collecte de données a changé (introduction de nouveaux codes R et D en accord avec la réglementation cadre sur les déchets de l’UE), ce qui a provoqué la perte d’information sur les quantités de déchets municipaux récupérées, principalement le recyclage et dans une moindre mesure le compostage. Slovenia Data refers to amounts generated, including waste from small enterprises, offices, institutions, restaurants, municipal services (street cleaning etc.), bulky waste and packages from households and businesses. The share of waste from households is estimated at 63% in 2022. Amounts of municipal waste that were temporary stored pending final treatment (which will take place in the next reference year) are excluded from waste treated. It is one of reasons for gap between amounts of municipal waste generated and treated. Other possible reasons are waste dehydration and drying out while waiting for further waste treatment. Municipal waste: includes separately collected fractions incinerated internally (incineration within the enterprises with concession for disposal of waste). Change of methodology in 2002 and in 2013. Before 2001 data is incomplete and based on pilot data collection. From 2004, new methodology: municipal waste generated refers not only to waste collected by public service system as until 2003, but also to waste collected by waste scheme (covering special wastes such as packaging, WEEE, medicines and waste candles from cemetery). Since 2013, the data on waste collection include waste from special waste collectors that were not included in the previous years. In 2015, Slovenia changed its methodology by partitioning outputs of 'other recovery' treatments between final recovery operations. This leads to a break in 2015 with an increase for recycling and incineration with energy recovery. Municipal waste collection covered 84% of the population in 1995, 90% in 1998, 95% in 2008 and 100% since 2011. Treatment: include pre-treatment operations and temporary storage into “Other recovery” and “Other disposal” categories. As of 2015, most of the amounts included in other recovery was allocated to recycling and incineration with energy recovery. The difference between amounts generated and treated is due to the evaporation of moisture during pre-treatments. Recycling: since 2002 include waste exported and exclude waste imported for recycling. Slovénie Les données se réfèrent aux quantités générées, incluant les déchets des petites entreprises, bureaux, institutions, restaurants, services municipaux (nettoyage des rues etc.), les encombrants et les emballages des ménages et des entreprises. La part des déchets ménagers est estimée à 63% en 2022. Les quantités de déchets municipaux stockés temporairement en attendant le traitement final (qui aura lieu au cours de la prochaine année de référence) sont exclues des déchets traités. C'est l'une des raisons qui expliquent l'écart entre les quantités de déchets municipaux produits et traités. D'autres raisons possibles sont la déshydratation et le séchage des déchets dans l'attente d'un traitement ultérieur. Déchets municipaux: incluent des fractions collectées séparément et incinérées en interne (incinération au sein des entreprises avec une concession pour l'élimination des déchets). Changement de méthodologie en 2002 et en 2013. Avant 2001, les données sont incomplètes et basées sur une collecte de données pilote. À partir de 2004, nouvelle méthodologie : les déchets municipaux générés se réfèrent non seulement aux déchets collectés par le système de service public comme jusqu'en 2003, mais aussi aux déchets collectés par le régime des déchets (couvrant les déchets spéciaux tels que les emballages, les DEEE, les médicaments et les bougies de cimetière). À partir de 2013 les données incluent également les quantités collectées par des collecteurs spéciaux. En 2015, la Slovénie a modifié sa méthodologie en répartissant les résultats des \"autres traitements de valorisation\" entre les opérations de valorisation finales. Cela conduit à une rupture en 2015 avec une augmentation pour le recyclage et l'incinération avec récupération d'énergie. La collecte municipale des déchets couvrait 84% de la population en 1995, 90% en 1998, 95% en 2008 et 100% depuis 2011. Traitement: inclut les opérations de pré-traitement et le stockage temporaire dans les catégories « Autre récupération » et « Autre élimination ». A partir de 2015, la plupart des quantités inclues dans autre récupération a été alloué au recyclage et à incinération avec récupération d’énergie. La différence entre les quantités produites et les quantités traitées est due à l’évaporation de l’humidité durant les pré-traitements. Recyclage: à partir de 2002, inclut les déchets exportés et exclut les déchets importés pour recyclage.  23 OECD, ENVIRONMENT STATISTICS DATABASE Landfill: includes residues from other treatment operations. The increase between 2022-23 is partly due to severe floods from August 2023 and higher amounts of bulky waste resulting from it. Mise en décharge: inclut des résidus du traitement d’autres opérations. L’augmentation entre 2022 et 2023 est en partie due aux graves inondations d’août 2023 et aux quantités plus importantes de déchets encombrants qui en ont résulté. Spain Data include Baleares and Canary Islands. Data refers to amounts collected, including waste from small enterprises, offices, institutions, restaurants, municipal services (street cleaning etc.), and bulky waste. Since 2009, data on waste treatment covers waste as it enters final treatment facilities, so that pre-treated amounts are excluded from the estimates. Both composting and recycling figures do not contain discarded waste from their respective operations (added to landfilling and incineration, respectively). Since 2004, the figure for municipal waste generated was computed after subtracting the amounts corresponding to (municipal) construction and demolition wastes and sludges (7% in 2004). Until 2003, these data were not subtracted from the overall figure as no information about this single variable was available. Municipal waste: includes household and similar waste from small businesses, bulky waste, waste from municipal services and separate collection. Waste from households: series from the Ministry of the Environment. Recycling: separate collection. Before 2013, data include separate collection of biodegradable kitchen and canteen waste and biodegradable garden and park waste treated in composting plants. Composting: includes the anaerobic digestion. Since 2013, data include separate collection of biodegradable kitchen and canteen waste and biodegradable garden and park waste treated in composting plants (previously in recycling). Since 2014, residues from composting are included in final treatment operations (landfill and incineration). For more information, see: https://www.ine.es/dyngs/INEbase/en/categoria.htm?c=Esta distica_P&cid=1254735976612 Espagne Les données Incluent les îles Baléares et Canaries. Les données se réfèrent aux quantités collectées, incluant les déchets des petites entreprises, bureaux, institutions, restaurants, services municipaux (nettoyage des rues etc.), et les encombrants. Depuis 2009, les données sur le traitement des déchets couvrent les déchets lorsqu'ils entrent dans les installations de traitement final, de sorte que les quantités prétraitées sont exclues des estimations. Les chiffres relatifs au compostage et au recyclage ne tiennent pas compte des déchets rejetés dans le cadre de leurs opérations respectives (ajoutés à la mise en décharge et à l'incinération, respectivement). Depuis 2004, le chiffre des déchets municipaux générés est calculé après soustraction des quantités correspondant aux déchets et boues de construction et de démolition (municipales) (7% en 2004). Jusqu'en 2003, ces données n'ont pas été soustraites du chiffre global car aucune information sur cette variable unique n'était disponible Déchets municipaux: déchets des ménages et déchets similaires des petites entreprises, encombrants, déchets des services municipaux et collecte séparative. Déchets des ménages: série du Ministère de l’Environnement. Recyclage: collecte séparative. Avant 2013, les données incluent la collecte séparative des déchets biodégradables de cuisine et de cantine et des parcs et jardins, traités dans des usines de compostage. Compostage: inclut la biométhanisation. A partir de 2013, les données incluent la collecte séparative des déchets biodégradables de cuisine et de cantine et des parcs et jardins, traités dans des usines de compostage. À partir de 2014, les résidus de compostages sont inclus dans les opérations de traitement finales (mise en décharge et incinération). Pour plus d’information, voir: https://www.ine.es/dyngs/INEbase/en/categoria.htm?c=Estadistica_ P&cid=1254735976612 Sweden Data refers to amounts collected, including commerce and trade, small businesses, office buildings, institutions municipal services, i.e. street and market cleaning, yard waste, litter containers and bulky waste. Treatment: data include on-site composting of kitchen, canteen, park and garden waste. Landfill: landfilling of sorted combustible waste is prohibited since 1 January 2002 and landfilling of organic waste since 2005. From 2020, construction and demolition waste is Suède Les données se réfèrent aux quantités collectées, incluant le commerce et les échanges, les petites entreprises, les immeubles de bureaux, les institutions les services municipaux, c'est-à-dire le nettoyage des rues et des marchés, les déchets de cour, les poubelles et les déchets encombrants. Traitement: les données incluent les déchets de cuisine, de cantine, de jardins et de parcs compostés in-situ. Mise en décharge: la mise en décharge est interdite depuis 2002 pour les déchets combustibles triés et depuis 2005 pour les déchets 24  entirely excluded. Since the reporting for 2020, non-target material from recycling-operations that is landfilled is included (residues from the treatment of glass, WEEE and batteries, metals and other hazardous waste). The differences between the amount of waste generated and treated are caused by the change of storage between the beginning of the year and the end of the year, however the temporary storage is believed to be minor. The near doubling of landfilling amounts in 2023 are due to the addition of waste collected by municipalities in collection sites. The additional amounts are dominated by inert and/or construction and demolition waste. A smaller share of the increase is due to an increase in losses from the recycling of glass packaging, that are landfilled. The level of detail in the data on waste treatment is insufficient to breakdown disposal that is not landfill into \"incineration\" or \"other\". Since 2020 the definition of municipal waste in the Swedish legislation is in line with the definition of municipal waste in the Directive 2008/98/EC. It similar, but not exactly equivalent to the previous definition used in the Swedish legislation. Additionally, there is only a partial overlap between \"waste under the responsibility of municipalities\" and municipal waste according to Directive 2008/98/EC. organiques. À partir de 2020, les déchets de construction et de démolition seront entièrement exclus. Depuis le rapport de 2020, les matériaux non ciblés provenant des opérations de recyclage qui sont mis en décharge sont inclus (résidus du traitement du verre, des DEEE et des piles, des métaux et autres déchets dangereux). Les différences entre la quantité de déchets produits et traités sont dues à la variation du stockage entre le début et la fin de l'année, mais le stockage temporaire est considéré comme mineur. Le quasi-doublement des volumes mis en décharge en 2023 est dû à l'ajout de déchets collectés par les municipalités dans les déchetteries. Ces volumes supplémentaires sont principalement constitués de déchets inertes et/ou de déchets de construction et de démolition. Une part plus faible de cette augmentation est due à une augmentation des pertes liées au recyclage des emballages en verre, mis en décharge. Le niveau de détail des données sur le traitement des déchets est insuffisant pour ventiler l'élimination qui n'est pas une mise en décharge en \"incinération\" ou \"autre\". Depuis 2020, la définition des déchets municipaux dans la législation suédoise est conforme à la définition des déchets municipaux dans la directive 2008/98/CE. Elle est similaire, mais pas exactement équivalente à la définition précédente utilisée dans la législation suédoise. En outre, il n'y a qu'un chevauchement partiel entre les \"déchets sous la responsabilité des municipalités\" et les déchets municipaux conformément à la directive 2008/98/CE. Switzerland Data refer to amounts collected. The Waste from households includes the urban waste from private households and small businesses for incineration collected by the municipal services, and the separately collected waste fractions from households and small businesses for recycling. Included in this amount is also the waste from street cleaning, litter containers etc. The Waste generated by other sources includes the waste for incineration delivered directly to the MWSI by private businesses as well as waste separately collected for recycling by private businesses. Data include bulky waste and packaging Composting: change in methodology in 2014. Recovery: the total recovered waste in 2021 does not include metals recovered from incineration bottom ash, which is included in incineration with energy recovery. Due to this item the total recovery is less than the sum of recycling, composting and incineration with energy recovery. For more information see: https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bafu/en/home/topics/waste.html Suisse Les données se réfèrent aux quantités collectées. Les déchets ménagers comprennent les déchets urbains des ménages et des petites entreprises destinés à l'incinération et collectés par les services municipaux, ainsi que les fractions de déchets collectées séparément auprès des ménages et des petites entreprises à des fins de recyclage. Sont également inclus dans cette quantité les déchets provenant du nettoyage des rues, des conteneurs à déchets, etc. Les déchets générés par d'autres sources comprennent les déchets à incinérer livrés directement à l'UIOM par les entreprises privées ainsi que les déchets collectés séparément pour le recyclage par les entreprises privées. Les données incluent les encombrants et les emballages. Compostage: changement de méthodologie en 2014. Valorisation : le total des déchets valorisés en 2021 ne comprend pas les métaux récupérés des mâchefers d'incinération, qui sont inclus dans l'incinération avec valorisation énergétique. C'est pourquoi la valorisation totale est inférieure à la somme du recyclage, du compostage et de l'incinération avec récupération d'énergie.

From 2004, improved data quality due to weighing of the waste amounts at the treatment sites. Break in series in 2004: municipalities started to measure waste data (as opposed to estimating it). Break in series in 2016: amounts of recoverable waste were reported for the first time. Decrease in municipal waste generation in 2022 can be explained by the “Zero Waste Project” of the Turkish Ministry of Environment. Türkiye is working to improve its data coverage by estimating and adding the municipal waste collection of the private sector, which is not included in the dataset. Municipal waste: includes estimate for population not served by waste services (around 1.2% of the population). The share of municipal waste originating from households is estimated at 81%. Treatment: exclude lake, sea and river disposal, and burning of waste in open areas. Composting: the decrease of the amounts composted is due to the closing of one composting facility which had important capacities. There is no seperate collection or recycling at source of biowaste. Recovery of municipal waste cannot be estimated. For more information see: http://www.turkstat.gov.tr/PreHaberBultenleri.do?id=30666 Les données incluent les déchets provenant des ménages, des institutions commerciales et des immeubles de bureaux, des bazars, des parcs, des jardins et des rues des zones résidentielles. À partir de 2004, amélioration de la qualité des données grâce à la pesée des quantités de déchets dans les sites de traitement. Rupture de série en 2004 : les municipalités ont commencé à mesurer les données sur les déchets (au lieu de les estimer). Rupture de série en 2016 : les quantités de déchets valorisables ont été déclarées pour la première fois. La baisse de la production de déchets municipaux en 2022 peut s'expliquer par le \"Projet zéro déchet\" du ministère turc de l'environnement. La Türkiye s'efforce d'améliorer la couverture de ses données en estimant et en ajoutant la collecte des déchets municipaux du secteur privé, qui n'est pas incluse dans l'ensemble de données. Déchets municipaux: incluent des estimations pour la population non desservie par un service municipal des déchets (environ 1.2% de la population). La part des déchets municipaux provenant des ménages est estimée à 81 %. Traitement: exclut les rejets en mer, rivières ou lacs et brûlage des déchets à ciel ouvert. Compostage: la baisse des quantités compostées est due à la fermeture d’une installation de compostage qui avait des capacités importantes. Il n'y a pas de collecte séparée ou de recyclage à la source des biodéchets La valorisation des déchets municipaux ne peut pas être estimée Pour plus d’information voir: http://www.turkstat.gov.tr/PreHaberBultenleri.do?id=30666 26  United Kingdom Figures are reported on a financial-year basis (April to March), however Scotland data (SEPA) is on calendar year basis. Data refer to amounts generated, including commerce and trade, small businesses, office buildings, institutions and municipal services, where that waste is collected by local authorities. It includes all waste collected by local authorities, and bulky waste, and may include a small proportion of construction and demolition waste. Share of waste from households in 2022/23 is 87.5% in England, 83.3% in Northern Ireland, 87.9% in Wales, 87.9% in Scotland. The decrease in 2003 is due to a hot and dry summer resulting in a smaller amount of organic waste. Waste from households: includes hazardous and clinical waste from households and waste from street cleansing and litter bins. 1990: estimated value which mainly includes waste collected from household dustbins and 5 million tonnes from \"Civic Amenity Sites\"; figures up to 1985 refer to England & Wales only and are less reliable than the 1990 estimation. Most of the data covers output data from treatment processes. Rejects from pre-treatment are assigned to either Landfill or Incineration. Outputs from Mechanical Biological Treatment: Organic materials sent for recovery are assigned to Other Recovery category. Recycling: 1995-1999 include composting. Other recovery: refuse derived fuel, waste used for backfilling, process loss from MBT facilities, incinerator bottom ash sent for recycling, metals from incineration sent for recycling. Other disposal: includes waste treated/disposed through other unspecified treatment processes as well as process and moisture loss. As of 2016, these amounts are allocated to landfill and incineration without energy recovery.

Les données incluent tous les déchets collectés par les autorités locales, et les encombrants, et peuvent inclure une petite quantité de déchets de construction et démolition. La part des déchets ménagers en 2022/23 est de 87,5 % en Angleterre, 83,3 % en Irlande du Nord, 87,9 % au Pays de Galles et 87,9 % en Écosse. La baisse en 2003 est due à la chaleur et la sécheresse particulières de l’été, qui ont résulté en un montant inférieur de déchets organiques Déchets des ménages: incluent les déchets dangereux et cliniques des ménages et les déchets de nettoyage des rues. 1990, valeur estimée incluant principalement des ordures ménagères et 5 millions de tonnes des sites locaux pour encombrants et déchets de jardin ; jusqu’en 1985: Angleterre et Pays de Galle uniquement, chiffres moins fiables que l’estimation 1990. La plupart des données couvrent les données de sortie des processus de traitement. Les rejets issus du prétraitement sont affectés à la mise en décharge ou à l'incinération. Les sorties du traitement biologique mécanique: Les matières organiques envoyées en vue d'une valorisation sont affectées à la catégorie \"Autres valorisations\". Recyclage: 1995-1999 inclut le compostage. Autre récupération: combustibles dérivés des déchets, déchets utilisés pour du remblayage, pertes dans le processus de traitement des installation TMB, cendres résiduelles d’incinération envoyées au recyclage, métaux d’incinération envoyé au recyclage. Autre élimination: inclut les déchets traités/éliminés par d’autres procédés non spécifiés ainsi que les pertes durant pendant le traitement et les pertes d’humidité. A partir de 2016 ces montants sont alloués à la mise en décharge et l’incinération sans récupération d’énergie.

Landfill: between 1991-93 and as of 1996, includes incineration without energy recovery. Other recovery: Break in time series in 2018. That year the United States expanded the scope of food waste estimates and since then data also cover “Other Food Management”, which include animal feed, bio-based materials/biochemical processing, codigestion/anaerobic digestion, donation, land application and sewer/wastewater treatment from the residential, commercial and institutional sectors. États-Unis Incinération avec récupération d’énergie: après récupération. Mise en décharge: entre 1991-93 et à partir de 1996, inclut l’incinération avec récupération d’énergie.

Son pourcentage a diminué, passant de 23,4 % en 2000 à 3 % en 2020. Azerbaijan Municipal waste: Total waste generated up to 2012 equals to waste landfilled. Since 2013 total for recovery operations equals only to ‘Incineration with energy recovery’ and total for disposal operations combines only ‘landfills’ and ‘incineration without energy recovery’. The calculations were based on the assumption that the population without access to waste services is equal to 35% in the period 2013-2021. Since 2013, the totals on municipal waste treated are higher than the combined totals of recovery and disposal operations. It is due to some amounts reported by Armenia in the category ‘Other’. Azerbaïdjan Déchets municipaux: Le total des déchets produits jusqu'en 2012 correspond aux déchets mis en décharge. Depuis 2013, le total des opérations de valorisation correspond uniquement à l'\"incinération avec récupération d'énergie\" et le total des opérations d'élimination combine uniquement les \"décharges\" et l'\"incinération sans récupération d'énergie\". Les calculs sont basés sur l'hypothèse que la population n'ayant pas accès aux services de gestion des déchets est égale à 35 % pour la période 2013-2021. Depuis 2013, les totaux relatifs aux déchets municipaux traités sont plus élevés que les totaux combinés des opérations de valorisation et d'élimination. Cela est dû à certains montants déclarés par l'Arménie dans la catégorie \"Autres\".

Since the reporting until 2019 was originally in cubic metres, these data were converted into tonnes by using the factor of 0.18 tonnes per 1 cubic metre. Total amounts generated and treated account exclusively for landfilling up to 2019. In the calculation of these figures, estimates were applied to account for the population without access to waste services. Its percentage decreased from 62% in 2016 to 51% in 2019. Until 2016, the volume of waste does not include waste from parks and gardens, leaves grass waste from street markets and street sweeping containers.

On waste management, Denmark is likely to meet the EU 2020 target of recycling 50 % of municipal waste. However, it has the highest municipal waste production per head in the EU27 and its circular (secondary) use of material is well below the EU average. Thus Denmark needs to primarily focus on reducing waste generation and improving its resource productivity. Furthermore, action is needed to reduce incineration (with energy recovery) of municipal waste; the high level of incineration is partly explained by the very low landfilling. The ERDF focuses on the circular economy and on promoting of competitiveness and innovation in small and medium sized enterprises. Regarding nature, the share of habitats in poor or bad status has increased in Denmark. Although all terrestrial sites have been designated, the quality of the current set of conservation objectives and measures is insufficient; they are being updated 2022-2023. The situation for forested areas protected under the nature directives is severe as more than half of assessments show they are in a bad conservation status. Denmark has a generally good capability to assess its state of the marine environment, although some descriptors are still missing. No recent information is available on ecosystem assessment and accounting. There are also concerns about sufficient financing of the Natura 2000 network (based on a finalised prioritised action framework (PAF), which has not yet been formally submitted to the European Commission). For air quality, Denmark plans to reach emission reduction commitments for sulphur and nitrogen oxides and non-methane volatile organic compounds for the period 2020-2029 and from 2030 onwards. However, the projections do not demonstrate compliance with emission reduction commitments for ammonia and particulate matter (PM2.5) for 2020-2029 and from 2030 onwards. Denmark did not exceed of EU air quality limit values in 2020, and has substantially improved air quality since the 2019 EIR with dedicated extra efforts. According to the last report on implementation of the Nitrates Directive, groundwater quality has slightly improved. The situation concerning the concentration of nitrates in surface water is stable and some improvements were recorded in reducing eutrophication. Nutrient inflows into the Baltic Sea around Denmark have significantly decreased for nitrogen in the Danish Straits and Kattegat, and for phosphorus in Kattegat. Improving nitrogen and phosphorus cycles helps improve circularity of the economy. Nevertheless, the Commission is closely monitoring the situation. The Recovery and Resilience Programme (RRP) makes the environmental transition in agriculture a specific target. On environmental financing, Denmark has a small RRP (2021-2026) with just over EUR 1.5 billion and a cohesion policy (2021-2027) allocation of EUR 500 million. Denmark’s overall environmental financing for investments is estimated to be annual 0.57% of GDP over the period 2014-2020, almost exclusively from national sources. The overall environmental investment needs in the coming years are estimated to be at least an annual 0.72% of Denmark’s GDP, suggesting an environmental investment gap of at least 0.15%, by focusing on the country’s environmental implementation priorities. Denmark 4 Environmental Implementation Review 2022 – Denmark Part I: Thematic areas 1. Circular economy and waste management Measures towards a circular economy The new Circular Economy Action Plan adopted in March 2020 is one of the main building blocks of the European Green Deal. The EU’s transition to a circular economy will reduce pressure on natural resources and will create sustainable growth and jobs. It is also a prerequisite to achieve the EU’s 2050 climate neutrality target and to halt biodiversity loss. The Action Plan announces initiatives along the entire life cycle of products, aiming to reduce the EU's consumption footprint and to double the EU's circular material use rate by 2030. It targets how products are designed, promotes circular economy processes, encourages sustainable consumption, and aims to ensure that waste is prevented and the resources used are kept in the EU economy for as long as possible. The circular material use rate is a good indicator of an economy’s circularity, as it includes all the materials that are fed back into the economy. Large differences in the circularity rate exist across countries. To help achieve the EU circular economy action plan’s goal of doubling the EU circular material use rate by 2030, ambitious measures targeting the whole product life cycle are needed at Member State level. Such measures range from sustainable product design to increase durability, reparability, upgradability and recyclability of products, to other measures such as remanufacturing1, increasing the circularity in production processes, recycling, as well as boosting eco-innovation and the uptake of green public procurement. Denmark’s circular (secondary) material use rate was 8.2% in 2016 and 7.7% in 2020, well below the EU average of 12.8%. The trend in Figure 1 shows a light fall in the use of secondary material in the past few years . 1 A standardized industrial process that takes place within industrial or factory settings, in which cores are restored to original as-new condition and performance or better. Figure 1: Circular material use rate (%), 2010-20202 Resource productivity expresses how efficiently the economy uses material resources to produce wealth. Improving resource productivity can help minimise negative impacts on the environment and reduce dependency on volatile raw material markets. As shown in Figure 2, with EUR 2.05 generated per kg of material consumed in 2020, resource productivity in Denmark is close to the EU average of EUR 2.09 per kg. More specifically, Denmark needs to reduce its Domestic Material Consumption and Raw Material Consumption. 2 Eurostat, Circular Economy Monitoring Framework. Denmark 5 Environmental Implementation Review 2022 – Denmark Figure 2: Resource productivity 2010-20203 Circular economy strategies The Commission encourages Member States to adopt and implement national/regional circular economy strategies covering the whole life cycle of products, as they are one of the most effective ways to progress towards a more circular economy. Since the launch of the European Circular Economy Stakeholder Platform in 20174, national, regional or local authorities have used the platform to share their strategies and roadmaps. The Danish government has in 2021 launched an action plan for circular economy5.. This plan describes the current conditions and the direction to follow for the prevention and management of waste in Denmark until 20326. The plan puts extra focus on how to make the value chains for biomass, construction and plastics become more circular. The Action Plan for Circular Economy contains a total of 129 initiatives, many of which are also included in Climate plan for a green waste sector and circular economy (2020), Strategy for Green Public Procurement (2020), National Strategy for a Sustainable Built Environment (2021), Strategy for circular economy (2018) and Action Plan on Plastics (2018). 3 Eurostat, Resource productivity 4 Circular Economy Stakeholder Platform 5 Danish Action Plan for Circular Economy July 2021 6 thus it represents Denmark’s waste prevention programme. Also worthy of note is the 2020 strategy for investments in green research, technology, and innovation, which contains a green mission (one of four) on circular economy focusing on reuse and reduction of plastic and textile waste7 Although Denmark’s recovery and resilience plan (RRP) does not contain reforms relating to circular economy, there is an investment dedicated to research on circular economy focusing on reuse and reduction of plastic and textile waste (EUR 23.5 million). The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) for 2021-27 also includes actions to boost the circular economy. Eco-innovation A successful transition to a circular economy requires social and technological innovation as the full potential of circular economy can only be reached when implemented across all value chains. Therefore, eco-Innovation is an important enabling factor for the circular economy. Product design approaches and new business models can help produce systemic circularity innovations, creating new business opportunities. In 2021, Denmark ranked 4th on the 2021 Eco-Innovation Scoreboard, with a total score of 177, resulting in an eco-innovation leader performance. On two out of five components (eco innovation activities and resource efficiency outcomes) of the 2021 Eco-Innovation Index, Denmark performed below the EU average. On eco-innovation inputs, eco innovation outputs and socioeconomic outcomes it performed above the EU average, ranking 1st in eco-innovation outputs. See Figure 3. 7 Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Science, 2020, Green solutions of the future. Denmark 6 Environmental Implementation Review 2022 – Denmark Figure 3 – Eco-innovation performance 2010-20198 EU Ecolabel and the eco management and audit scheme (EMAS) The number of EU Ecolabel products and EMAS-licensed9 organisations in a given country provides some indication of the extent to which the private sector and national bodies are actively engaged in the transition to a circular economy. It also shows how committed public authorities are to supporting schemes designed to promote the circular economy. As of September 2021, Denmark had 2 465 products out of 83 590, and 81 licences out of 2 057, registered in the EU Ecolabel scheme, showing a high take-up of these schemes10. As of October 2021, 14 organisations from 48 sites in Denmark are registered in the EMAS scheme. Since the last report in 2019, there has been 1 299 new product and 25 licences registrations of the EU Ecolabel, but there has been a decrease in the number of organisations registered with EMAS, by 14 organisations since 2019. 8 European Commission - Directorate-General for Environment (DG ENV), Eco-innovation Observatory, Eco-innovation index. 9 EMAS is the European Commission’s Eco-Management and Audit Scheme, a programme to encourage organisations to behave in a more environmentally sustainable way. 10European Commission, Ecolabel Facts and Figures. Green public procurement Public procurement accounts for a large proportion of European consumption, with public authorities’ purchasing power representing around 14% of EU GDP. This can help drive the demand for sustainable products that meet repairability and recyclability standards. Denmark adopted a green public procurement strategy in October 2020 (Green Procurement for a Green Future), which put the public sector at the forefront of the green transition. Around EUR 25 billion is spent per year in Denmark on public procurement of goods and services, which is around 10% of GDP. The strategy includes a target that all public procurement on areas where official ecolabelling schemes exist must be eco-labeled or comply with corresponding requirements by 2030. Denmark has been one of the first countries to comprehensively assess the climate footprint from public procurement. In 2019, procurement on behalf of the government, municipal, and regional authorities resulted in a climate footprint totalling approximately 12 million tons, of which around 4 million tons were emitted in Denmark. Based on the assessment made, Denmark plans to set an emission reduction target in 202211. Denmark received a study visit using the EIR peer to peer tool on transferring knowledge and practice on setting up effective repair and reuse systems 24-25 September 201812 to learn from Belgium’s experience. Since Denmark’s circular material use rate is far below the EU average a priority action on this is proposed. 2022 priority actions  adopt measures to increase the circular material use rate, and lower Domestic Material and Raw Material Consumption, learning from best EU practices. Waste management Turning waste into a resource is supported by: (i) fully implementing EU waste legislation, which includes the waste hierarchy, the need to ensure separate collection of waste, the landfill diversion targets, etc.; (ii) reducing waste generation and waste generation per capita in absolute terms; (iii) limiting energy recovery to non-recyclable materials and phasing out landfilling of recyclable or recoverable waste. 11 Danish Ministry of Finance, Green Procurement for a Green Future, 2020, p.4. 12 EIR peer to peer Denmark 7 Environmental Implementation Review 2022 – Denmark This section focuses on the management of municipal waste13 for which EU law sets mandatory recycling targets. Preventing products and materials from becoming waste for as long as possible is the most efficient way to improve resource efficiency and to reduce the environmental impact of waste. Waste prevention including re-use are the most preferred options; they top the waste hierarchy. The volume of municipal waste generated is a good indicator of the effectiveness of waste prevention measures. After a stable trend, municipal waste generation in Denmark has started to increase again in recent years. It amounted to 845 kg/year/inhabitant in 2020, the highest in the EU (EU average 505 kg/year/inhabitant), as Figure 4 shows. It indicates that Denmark’s economic growth is not yet decoupled from waste generation. This is an issue of waste prevention. In the 2019 EIR Denmark had two priority actions on waste: to introduce new policy instruments to promote waste prevention and recycling and to shift away from incineration. Figure 4: Municipal waste by treatment in Denmark, 2011-20201914 Figure 4 also shows municipal waste by type of treatment, in kilos produced per person. Much of the waste in Denmark is incinerated with energy recovery (382 kg per person in 2020). 13 municipal waste consists of (a) mixed waste and separately collected waste from households, including paper and cardboard, glass, metals, plastics, bio-waste, wood, textiles, packaging, waste electrical and electronic equipment, waste batteries and accumulators, and bulky waste, including mattresses and furniture; (b) mixed waste and separately collected waste from other sources, where such waste is similar in nature and composition to waste from households. (Directive 2008/98/EC, Article. 3 2b). 14 Eurostat, Municipal waste by waste operation, april 2022. By 2019, there were 23 dedicated and multi-fired incineration plants in Denmark, of which 17 plants are municipally owned. It is expected that moving to private ownership will lead to an adjustment of the current over-capacity over time. This may lead to some investment losses, although most incineration plants are more than 20 years old. No new plants are envisaged. In June 2020, Denmark decided that it must reduce capacity for waste incineration to correspond to the amount of residual waste from Denmark in 2030, which entails an expected reduction in capacity by approximately 30% from 2020 to 2030, and that the treatment of residual waste must be sent out for tender in order to optimise waste treatment both environmentally and economically15. Thus, it is assessed that there is a need to close several municipal incineration plants – corresponding to the expected need for incineration capacity for domestically generated residual waste in 2030. As part of this political agreement DKK 200 million are reserved for stranded assets in incineration plants16. Figure 5 and national projections17 shows that Denmark is moving towards the EU’s 2025 municipal waste recycling target of 55%, as 53.9% in 2020 was recycled (EU average (47.8%)). The EU action plan for circular economy includes a number of targeted policy initiatives to ensure compliance with the 2025 targets. The level of recycling in Denmark is not directly linked to the level of investments in recycling plants in Denmark. As a small open economy most of Denmark’s recyclable waste is exported to neighbouring Sweden and Germany for material recycling. Waste exported to be recycled abroad still counts towards towards Denmark’s overall recycling rate so exporting waste to be recycled does not inherently limit improving a country’s recycling rate.

Final draft 22.12.2021 17 Danish Environmental Protection Agency, Baseline projection 18 Eurostat, Recycling rate of municipal rate, April 2022. Denmark 8 Environmental Implementation Review 2022 – Denmark Denmark was not listed in the Commission's Early Warning report'19 at risk of missing the EU 2020 target of 50 % collected for recycling of municipal waste. The Commission is currently finalising its analysis of the progress on the recommendations from the 2018 Early Warning Reports and analysis of progress towards achieving the 2025 waste recycling targets. This report will be presented at the end of 2022 and will assess the progress made to date. Implementation of the 2018 waste legislative package Denmark has notified the Commission that it has transposed the 2018 waste package. A conformity assessment is now ongoing. Waste management plans and waste prevention programmes (referred to in the section on circular economy) are instrumental for a sound implementation of the EU waste legislation. They set out key provisions and investments to ensure compliance with existing and new legal requirements (e.g. on waste prevention, separate collection for a number of specific waste streams, recycling and landfill targets). Revised plans and programmes were due on 5 July 2020. Denmark’s revised waste management plan & waste prevention programme from July 2021 is acceptable20. The plan aims to reduce waste generation and shift away from incineration with energy recovery as there is overcapacity and towards more recycling. Denmark has 19 European Commission, Report on the implementation of waste legislation, including the early warning report for Member States at risk of missing the 2020 preparation for re-use/recycling target on municipal wasteCOM(2018)656. 20 Danish Ministry of Environment, Handlingsplan-for-cirkulaer-oekonomi implemented door to door collection within walking distance from houses (depending on the logistics of the area) for nine fractions of household waste. However, Denmark must take more action to ensure compliance with the recycling targets for the post-2020 period. Therefore, only limited progress was made on both priority actions since 2019, and in the light of the Early Warning Report 2022 they are repeated. National plans, programmes and strategies also need to be implemented. 2022 priority actions  Bring in new policy instruments, including economic instruments. These instruments should: (i) promote waste prevention; (ii) make preparing for waste reuse and recycling more economically attractive.  Shift reusable and recyclable waste away from incineration with energy recovery. Denmark 9 Environmental Implementation Review 2022 – Denmark 2. Biodiversity and natural capital The 2030 EU biodiversity strategy adopted in May 2020 aims to put the EU’s biodiversity on a path to recovery and sets out new targets and governance mechanisms to achieve healthy and resilient ecosystems. In particular, the strategy sets out ambitious targets to: (i) protect a minimum of 30% of the EU’s land area and 30% of its sea area and integrate ecological corridors, as part of a true trans-European nature network; (ii) strictly protect at least a third of the EU’s protected areas, including all remaining EU primary and old-growth forests; (iii) effectively manage all protected areas, defining clear conservation objectives and measures, and monitoring them appropriately. The strategy also sets out an EU nature restoration plan – a series of concrete commitments and actions to restore degraded ecosystems across the EU by 2030, and manage them sustainably, addressing the key drivers of biodiversity loss. The Habitats and the Birds Directives are key legislative tools to achieve the EU biodiversity strategy targets. They are the cornerstone of EU legislation governing wildlife conservation21. Denmark’s national biodiversity strategy is entitled ‘The Danish Nature Policy — Our Shared Nature’22. Adopted in 2014, it contains a long-term vision for 2050 and serves as Denmark’s revised national biodiversity strategy and action plan. In 2020 there was a political agreement on nature and biodiversity23 and in 2021 on green cities24. Nature protection and restoration Natura 200025, the largest coordinated network of protected areas in the world, is the key instrument to achieve the Birds and Habitats Directives' objectives to ensure the long term protection, conservation and survival of Europe's most valuable and threatened 21 These should be reinforced by the Nature Restoration Law, according to the EU’s new biodiversity strategy. 22 Danish Nature Policy – our share nature 23 Political agreement on nature and biodiversity. 24 Political agreement on green cities. 25 Natura 2000 comprises Sites of Community Importance (SCIs) designated pursuant to the Habitats Directive as well as Special Protection Areas (SPAs) classified pursuant to the Birds Directive; figures of coverage do not add up due to the fact that some SCIs and SPAs overlap. Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) means a SCI designated by the Member States. species and habitats and the ecosystems they underpin. The setting up of a coherent Natura 2000 network, the designation of Sites of Community Importance (SCI) as Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) and the setting of conservation objectives and measures for the Natura 2000 sites are key milestones towards meeting the objectives of the Directives. Setting up a coherent network of Natura 2000 sites Denmark hosts 60 habitat types26 and 79 species27 covered by the Habitats Directive. The country also hosts populations of 54 bird taxa listed in Annex I the Birds Directive28. By 2021, 8.3% of Denmark’s territory was covered by Natura 2000 (against the EU average of 18.5%), see Figure 7. Special Protection Areas (SPAs) classified under the Birds Directive covered 6% (against the EU average of 12.8%) and SCIs under the Habitats Directive covered 7.4 % (EU average 14.2%) of Danish territory. The latest assessment of the SPA part of the Natura 2000 network shows that Demark’s designation of the network of marine SPAs was insufficient to cover several important bird areas (IBAs). The Danish government on 12 November 2021, with an Order No 2091, proceeded with the designation of 6 new SPAs29, and promised 6 December 2021 to look further at appointing additional marine areas as SPAs. The Danish government initiated in 2018 a procedure to adjust the boundaries of the sites within its Natura 2000 network. This procedure is still ongoing. The Commission will be able to finalise its assessment after receiving full justifications for each proposed change. Considering both Natura 2000 and other nationally designated protected areas, Denmark legally protects 15.1% of its territory (against the EU 27 average of 26.4%) and 18,7% of marine areas (against the EU 27 average of 10.7%)30.

However, the quality of the current conservation objectives and measures is insufficient and will be updated in 2022/23. Moreover, the management plans are not sufficiently linked with other applicable legislation to tackle agriculture emissions which exert high pressure on species and habitats.; these aspects will also be a part of the coming plans, which were in public consultation in spring 2022. Progress in maintaining or restoring favourable conservation status of species and habitats The results of Habitats Directive Article 17 and Birds Directive Article 12 reports on progress towards maintaining or restoring the favourable conservation status of species and habitats are key to measure the performance of Member States. According to the report submitted by Denmark on the conservation status of habitats and species covered by Article 17 of the Habitats Directive for the period 2013-2018, the share of assessments for habitats in good conservation status in 2018 is only 5% which is the second lowest in the EU and the same as the number reported under the previous reporting period (2007-2012), see Figure 8. As to protected species, the share of assessments in good conservation status in 2018 is 20% which is less than the 32% reported under the previous reporting period (2007-2012), see Figure 9. The bird conservation results with 54% show that the population of breeding species was either increasing in the short term or stable (for wintering species this figure was 27%). The share of habitats in bad conservation status has remained at 77% and the share of assessments for species in bad conservation status has increased to 34%, as shown in Figure 833.. The main pressures come from agriculture, mixed sources of pollution, development, construction and use of residential, commercial, industrial and recreational infrustructure and alien and problematic species. 33 EEA, State of Nature in the EU 2021.

The second was to put in place clearly defined conservation measures for sites, and to provide adequate resources; on the first aspect there is limited progress since the management plans for the new planning period to put in place clearly defined conservation objectives and measures were in public consultation in spring 2022; on the second aspect, considering that Denmark has not submitted a complete priotised action framework (see section 5), a new priority action is included. 2022 priority actions  increase efforts to ensure that the Natura 2000 network is managed in a way that achieves the favourable conservation status of protected habitats and species, especially by reducing main pressures such as from agriculture.  finalize the update of the Natura 2000 management plans to be adopted for the next planning cycle to ensure that their conservation objectives and measures are clearly defined, sufficiently detailed and linked with other applicable legislation and plans to achieve favourable conservation status.  complete and submit a finalised PAF. Bringing nature back to agricultural land and restoring soil ecosystems Agricultural land The biodiversity strategy works alongside the new farm to fork strategy and the new common agricultural policy (CAP) to support and achieve the transition to fully sustainable agriculture. The biodiversity and farm to fork strategies have set four important targets for 2030: - a 50% reduction in the overall use of – and risk from – chemical pesticides; - a 50% reduction in the use of more hazardous pesticides; - a 50% reduction in losses of nutrients from fertilisers while ensuring there is no deterioration of soil fertility (which will result in a 20% reduction in the use of fertilisers); - bring back at least 10% of agricultural area under high-diversity landscape features and increase areas under organic farming to at least 25%. Denmark 12 Environmental Implementation Review 2022 – Denmark Denmark has an estimated 11.45% of area under organic farming, slightly above the EU average of 9,07% (2020)38, see Figure 10. Figure 10: Share of total utilised agricultural area occupied by organic farming per Member State39 The agricultural sector in Denmark has a level of high productivity. However, intensive farming generates negative impacts on the environment and climate, such as nutrient leaching, GHG emissions, loss of habitats and biodiversity40. The farmland bird index fell from 79.3 in 2011 to 72 in 2019 (2000 = 100)41. Soil ecosystems Soil is a finite and extremely fragile resource. It is increasingly degrading in the EU. The new EU soil strategy, adopted on 17 November 2021, stresses the importance of soil protection, of sustainable soil management and of restoring degraded soils to achieve the Green Deal objectives as well as land-degradation neutrality by 2030. This entails: (i) preventing further soil degradation; (ii) making sustainable soil management the new normal; (iii) taking action for ecosystem restoration. One example of soil degradation is the area of soil that is sealed or artificialised42 (Figure 11). The net land 38 Eurostat, organic farming 39 Eurostat, Area under organic farming, February 2022. 40 Commission Reccomendations for Denmark’s CAP Plan, 2021 41 Eurostat Farmland Bird Index. 42 Artificial land cover is defined as the total of roofed built-up areas (including buildings and greenhouses), artificial non built-up areas (including sealed area features, such as yards, farmyards, cemeteries, car parking areas etc. and linear features, such as streets, roads, railways, runways, bridges) and other artificial areas (including bridges taken per year in the period 2012-2018 can be seen as a measure of one important pressure on nature and biodiversity - land use change - which constitutes at the same time an environmental pressure on people living in urbanised areas. Despite falling during the last decade (land take was over 1000km2/year between 2000-2006), land take in EU28 still amounted to 539km2/year between 2012-201843. The net land take concept combines land take with the share of land returned to non-artificial land use (re-cultivation). While some land was re-cultivated in the EU28 in the period 2000-2018, 11 times more land was taken. Denmark ranks above the EU average on land take with net land take of 152.8m2/km2 2012-2018 (EU27 average: 83.8 m2/km2). 44. In 2018, Denmark updated its reporting on land degradation in line with the next Performance Review and Implementation System (PRAIS3) reporting platform45. It includes actions intended to combat land degradation . However, Denmark has not yet committed to set land degradation neutrality targets under the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) 46.

The Strategy promotes the many services that forests provide. Its’ key objective is to ensure healthy, diverse and resilient EU forests, that contribute significantly to strengthened biodiversity and climate ambition. Forests are important carbon sinks and their conservation efforts are vital for the EU’s vision of achieving climate neutrality by 2050. Of the 27% of EU forest area protected under the Habitats Directive, less than 15% of areas assessed were found to be in a favourable conservation status48. The share of forest area in the EU in a bad conservation status increased from 27% in 2015 to 31%. In Denmark, forests cover 12.19% of land49 with 21 000ha in Denmark covered by primary forests50.

Figure 12: Conservation status of forests protected under the Habitats Directive in EU Member States, 2013-2018 (% assessments)52 In accordance with the EU Timber Regulation (EUTR)53, which prohibits placing illegally harvested timber on the EU market, EU Member States competent authorities must conduct regular checks on operators and traders, and apply penalties for any breaches. By amending Article 20 of the EUTR, biennial reporting became annual and covers the calendar year as of 2019. In the period March 2017 - February 201954, Denmark carried out 49 checks on operators importing timber. It is estimated that Denmark had 24 000 operators placing domestic timber and 3 889 operators placing imported timber onto the internal market over the reporting period. The new Deforestation Regulation38 will repeal and replace the EU Timber Regulation, as it will essentially integrate and improve the existing system to control timber legality.

Besides inflicting major damage on nature and the economy, many IAS also facilitate the outbreak and spread of infectious diseases, posing a threat to humans and wildlife. The implementation of the EU Invasive Alien Species Regulation and other relevant legislation must be stepped up. The biodiversity strategy for 2030 aims to manage recognised invasive alien species and decrease the number of ‘red list’ species they threaten by 50%. The core of Regulation (EU) 1143/2014 on invasive alien species. (the IAS Regulation55) is the list of Invasive Alien Species of Union concern. There are currently 66 invasive alien species (IAS) of EU concern , of which: 30 are animal species and 36 are plant species; 41 are primarily land species, 23 are primarily freshwater species, 1 is a brackish-water species and 1 is a marine species. A 2021 report56 on the review of the application of the IAS Regulation based on reports that Member States submitted for the period 2015-2018, showed the implementation of the IAS Regulation is already starting to deliver on its objectives such as a coherent framework for addressing IAS at EU level and has increased awareness of the problem of IAS, including among the general public. At the same time, the above report identified some challenges and areas for improvement. Given that the deadlines for implementing the various obligations of the IAS Regulation applied gradually between July 2016 and July 2019, it is premature to draw conclusions on several aspects of the implementation of the IAS Regulation. Another 2021 report57 on the baseline distribution shows that of the 66 species on the Union list, 18 have 55 Regulation (EU) No 1143/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2014 on the prevention and management of the introduction and spread of invasive alien species 56 Report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the review of the application of Regulation (EU) No 1143/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2014 on the prevention and management of the introduction and spread of invasive alien species, COM(2021) 628 final, 13.10.2021 57 Cardoso A.C., Tsiamis K., Deriu I., D' Amico F., Gervasini E., EU Regulation 1143/2014: assessment of invasive alien species of Union concern distribution, Member States reports vs JRC baselines, EUR 30689 EN, 2021, ISBN 978-92-76-37420-6, doi:10.2760/11150, JRC123170. been observed in the environment in Denmark. The spread can be checked in Figure 13. Denmark had a priority action in 2019 to remedy the lack of data, and seek ways to improve its surveillance system. In the 2019 Article 24 report, it is indicated that in Denmark, there is a registration website for IAS for citizens to register observations, which are then verified by the Danish Environmental Protection Agency. These data are especially important for rapid eradication actions. Additionally, Denmark has a national programme (NOVANA) for surveillance of IAS, and when new species are added to the EU list, they are included in the programme. Moreover, IAS are included in several surveillance projects, e.g., altas projects, and projects using new technologies, such as eDNA and satellite data. Figure 13: Number of IAS of EU concern, based on available georeferenced information for Denmark, 2021 Marine ecosystems The EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 aims to substantially reduce the negative impacts on sensitive species and habitats in marine ecosystems and to achieve good environmental status as well as eliminate or reduce the incidental catches of protected, endangered, threatened and sensitive species to a level Denmark 15 Environmental Implementation Review 2022 – Denmark that allows species recovery and conservation58. The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD)59 requires Member States to achieve good environmental status (GES) of their marine waters. To that end, Member States must develop marine strategies for their marine waters, and cooperate with Member States sharing the same marine regarion or subregion. These marine strategies comprise different steps to be developed and implemented over six-year cycles. Among other obligations, the MSFD requires Member States by 15 October 2018 to define a set of GES characteristics for each descriptor (Article 9), and to provide an initial assessment of their marine waters (article 8). The Commission then assesses whether this constitutes an appropriate framework to meet the requirements of the Directive. The Commission assessed Denmark’s 2018 determinations of GES for each of the 11 descriptors in the MSFD60 and determined their adequacy in relation to the Commission GES Decision61. A good or very good score indicates that the national GES determinations are well aligned with the requirements of the GES Decision, providing qualitative and quantitative national environmental objectives to be achieved for their marine waters (Figure 14). 58 The EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) aims to contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the environmental legislation for marine ecosystems. 59 Marine Strategy Framework Directive 2008/56/EC 60 Annex I to Directive 2008/56/EC. 61 Commission Decision (EU) 2017/848 laying down criteria and methodological standards on the good environmental status of marine waters and specifications and standardised methods for monitoring and assessment, and repealing Decision 2010/477/EU. Figure 14: Level of adequacy of GES determination by Denmark (ANS and BAL regions) with criteria set under the Commission GES Decision - Article 9 (2018 reporting exercise)62 Denmark has two marine sub-regions: ANS-NE Atlantic, the Greater North Sea. In this sub-region, 6 out of 11 determinations of GES were assessed as good or very good63. Denmark’s assessment of GES is coherent with the MSFD for 6 out of 11 descriptors. BAL, the Baltic Sea. In this marine sub-region, 4 out of 11 determinations of GES were assessed as good or very good. Denmark’s assessment of GES is coherent with the MSFD for 4 out of 11 descriptors. The MSFD also requires that Member States make an assessment of the current environmental status of their marine waters in relation to the GES determination. A good or very good score indicates that the Member State has good capabilities to assess their marine environment in accordance with the requirements set out in the Commission GES Decision (Figure 15). 62 Assessment carried out by the European Commission of the data reported by the Member States, January 2022. Please note that only two sub-sections of descriptor D1 are displayed (D1-M Mammals and D1-B Birds). For the analysis, these two sub-sections were considered as a whole after averaging them. 63Only one part of D1 (Mammals) and D2-D11 are displayed. Denmark 16 Environmental Implementation Review 2022 – Denmark Figure 15: Level of adequacy of national assessment of Denmark’s marine environment (ANS and BAL regions) with criteria set under the Commission GES Decision - Article 8 (2018 reporting exercise)64 In the marine sub-region ANS-NE Atlantic, the Greater North Sea, 6 descriptors out of 11 were scored as good or very good. Denmark’s assessment of its marine environment is coherent with the requirements set under the Commission GES Decision for 6 out of 11 descriptors. In the marine sub-region BAL, the Baltic Sea, 7 descriptors out of 11 were scored as good or very good. Denmark’s assessment of its marine environment is coherent with the requirements set under the Commission GES Decision for 7 out of 11 descriptors. In the 2019 EIR, Denmark had a priority action to achieve timely reporting under the MFSD. It has made limited progress on this with several descriptors missing. As highlighted in the Commission’s report on the implementation of the MSFD65, although regional cooperation has improved since the adoption of the MSFD, more cooperation is needed to meet the requirements under the Directive of full regional coherence of the marine strategies. 64 Assessment carried out by the European Commission of the data reported by the Member States, January 2022. Please note that only two sub-sections of descriptor D1 are displayed (D1-M Mammals and D1-B Birds). For the analysis, these two sub-sections were considered as a whole after averaging them. 65 COM(2020)259 Furthermore, in March 2022, the European Commission published a Communication with recommendations for Member States. The Commission assessment highlights that Member States need to step up their efforts to determine the good environmental status and the use of the criteria and methodological standards according to the Commission GES Decision. The above considerations form the basis for the 2022 priority actions. 2022 priority actions  ensure regional cooperation with Member States sharing the same marine (sub)region to address the main environmental pressures;  implement the recommendations made by the Commission in the staff working document66 accompanying the Communication67 on recommendations per Member States and region on the 2018 updated reports for Articles 8, 9 and 10 of the MSFD. Ecosystem assessment and accounting The EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 calls on Member States to better integrate biodiversity considerations into public and business decision making at all levels and to develop natural capital accounting. The EU needs a better performing biodiversity-observation network and more consistent reporting on the condition of ecosystems. As mentioned in the 2019 EIR, Denmark has been involved with MAES68 since 2014 in collaboration with universities. A report was published in 201769 illustrating the synergies and trade-offs for six different scenarios between six ecosystem services and biodiversity. A case study also showed that it is possible to combine existing spatial data layers and models to facilite analyses of the effects of land use changes across many ecosystem services and biodiversity indicators. A follow up project on two modelling components has been carried out70. No progress has been recorded since January 2016 (Figure 16). This assessment is based on 27 implementation questions, updated every six months. Progress on ecosystem accounting implementation is assessed at national level based on 13 questions. 66 SWD(2022)1392. 67 COM(2022)550. 68 Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services. 69 Aarhus University report 70 Termansen M et al.

Denmark 18 Environmental Implementation Review 2022 – Denmark 3. Zero pollution Clean air EU clean-air policies and legislation need to significantly improve air quality in the EU, moving the EU closer to the quality recommended by the WHO and curbing emissions of key air pollutants. Air pollution and its impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity should be further reduced with the long-term aim of not exceeding critical loads and levels. This requires strengthening efforts to reach full compliance with EU clean-air legislation and defining strategic targets and actions for 2030 and beyond. The 2030 zero-pollution action-plan targets are to reduce the health impacts of air pollution by 55% and to reduce the EU ecosystems threatened by air pollution by 25%, compared to 2005. The EU has developed a comprehensive suite of air quality legislative measures, which set health-based air quality standards72 and emission reduction commitments73 per Member State for a number of air pollutants. Air quality in Denmark is generally good with exceptions. The latest available annual estimates by the European Environment Agency (for 2019)74 indicate about 2 900 premature deaths (or 30 700 years of life lost (YLL)) attributable to fine particulate matter concentrations75 and 150 (1600 YLL) to ozone concentrations7677. The emissions of key air pollutants have fallen significantly in Denmark over the last years, while GDP growth continued (see Figure 17). According to the latest projections as submitted under Article 10(2) of the National Emission Reduction Commitments Directive (NECD)78, Denmark expects to reach its emission reduction commitments for SOx, NOx and NMVOC for the period 2020 to 2029 and from 2030 onwards. The projections however do not demonstrate reaching emission reduction commitments for NH3 and PM2.5 for 72 European Commission, 2016. Air Quality Standards 73European Commission, Reduction of National Emissions 74 EEA, Air Quality in Europe –2021 Report. Please see details in this report as regards the underpinning methodology, p.106 75 Particulate matter (PM) is a mixture of aerosol particles (solid and liquid) covering a wide range of sizes and chemical compositions. PM10 (PM2.5) refers to particles with a diameter of 10 (2.5) micrometres or less. PM is emitted from many human sources, including combustion. 76 Low-level ozone is produced by photochemical action on pollution 77 Please note that these figures refer to the impacts of individual pollutants, and to avoid double-counting cannot be added up to derive a sum. 78 Directive 2016/2284/EU. 2020 to 2029 and from 2030 onwards. Latest inventory data submitted by Denmark, prior to review by the Commission, indicate that Denmark is in compliance with the emission reduction commitments for NOx, NMVOC, SO2 and PM2.5, and in non-compliance with the emission reduction commitment for NH3 in 2020. Denmark has submitted a National Air Pollution Control Programme on 1 April 2019 and an update on 11 August 2021. Figure 17: Emission trends of main pollutants/GDP in Denmark, 2005-201979 Figure 18 shows the emissions of PM2.5 and NOx by economic sector. Figure 18: PM2.5 and NOx emissions by sector in Denmark (2019)80 79 EEA. 80 EEA. Denmark 19 Environmental Implementation Review 2022 – Denmark In 2020, Denmark did not register any cases exceeding the limit values set under the Ambient Air Quality Directive.81. According to latest air pollutant emission projections additional measures would be needed to achieve the NECD emission reduction commitments. In the 2019 EIR, Denmark had two priority actions. The first was to take specific action under the national air pollution control programme (NAPCP) to reduce the main emission sources, in particular to reduce PM2.5 and ammonia. The second was to reduce ammonia ceilings to comply with national emission ceilings, by shifting to low-emission agricultural measures. Denmark has achieved limited progress on both fronts. 2022 priority actions  take action under the NAPCP to reduce emissions from the main sources mentioned above.  ensure full compliance with the EU air quality standards and maintain downward emissions trends of air pollutants, to reduce adverse air pollution impacts on health and economy with a view to reaching WHO guideline values in the future. Industrial emissions The main objectives of EU policy on industrial emissions are to: (i) protect air, water and soil; (ii) prevent and manage waste; (iii) improve energy and resource efficiency; (iv) clean up contaminated sites. To achieve this, the EU takes an integrated approach to the prevention and control of routine and accidental industrial emissions. The cornerstone of the policy is the 81 EEA, Eionet Central Data Repository Industrial Emissions Directive82 (IED). The Commission tabled a proposal in April 202283. The revision seeks to improve the Directive’s contribution to the zero-pollution objective, as well as its consistency with climate, energy and circular-economy policies. The overview of industrial activities regulated by the IED is based on data reported to the EU Registry (2018)84. In Denmark, around 2 350 industrial installations are required under the IED to have a permit. This represents an increase of about 70 installations since 2015, largely due to an increase in the intensive rearing of poultry or pigs but also in the waste management sector. The distribution of installations is shown in Figure 19. Industrial sectors in Denmark with the most installations in 2018 are intensive poultry and pig rearing (68%), followed by the waste management sector, including landfills (15%), the food, drink and milk sector (5%) and the energy sector (4%). 82 Directive 2010/75/EU covers industrial activities carried out above certain thresholds. It covers the energy industry, metal production, the mineral and chemical industry, waste management, and a wide range of industrial and agricultural sectors (e.g. intensive rearing of pigs and poultry, pulp and paper production, painting and cleaning). 83 European Commission, proposal for a revision of the Industrial Emissions Directive, 4 April 2022. The revision of the IED is performed in parallel to the revision of Regulation (EC) No 166/2006 on the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR). 84 EEA. Denmark 20 Environmental Implementation Review 2022 – Denmark Figure 19: Number of IED industrial installations per sector in Denmark, 201885 The industrial sectors identified as contributing the largest burden to the environment for emissions to air were the energy sector for sulphur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx) as well as for cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr) and mercury (Hg); the waste management sector for lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), and dioxins; the mineral industry for arsenic (As); and intensive rearing of poultry and pigs for ammonia (NH3) and PM2.5. The breakdown is given in Figure 20. 85 EEA, EU Registry, European Industrial Emissions Portal (data retrieved on 3 November 2021). Figure 20: Emissions to air from IED sectors and rest of national total air emissions in Denmark, 201886 The environmental burdens for industrial emissions to water mainly result from the waste management for total nitrogen, phosphorous, from landfills for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), from the energy sector for total organic carbon (TOC) and from the pulp and paper sector for heavy metals. Figure 21 provides the breakdown by substance based on E-PRTR data. 86 EEA, LRTAP, Air pollutant emissions data viewer (Gothenburg Protocol, LRTAP Convention) 1990-2019 (data retrieved on 3 November 2021). Denmark 21 Environmental Implementation Review 2022 – Denmark Figure 21: Relative releases to water from industry in Denmark, 201887 The EU approach taken to enforcing the IED requirements creates strong rights for the public to have access to information and to participate in the permitting process. This empowers individuals and NGOs, to ensure that permits are appropriately granted and their conditions followed. As part of environmental inspection, competent authorities carry out site visits to IED installations to take samples and to collect the requisite information. According to Article 23(4) of the IED, site visits are carried out between once every year and once every three years, depending on the environmental risks posed by the installations. In 2018, Denmark carried out 1 597 site visits, the majority to installations for intensive poultry or pig rearing (66%), followed by the waste management sector, including landfills and the food drink milk sector (8%), as shown in Figure 22. 87 EEA, EU Registry, European Industrial Emissions Portal. The heavy metals are presented both as a weighted sum of eco toxicity and human toxicity factors to illustrate both the ecological and human impact (based on USEtox) (data retrieved on 3 November 2021). Figure 22: Number of inspections in IED installations in Denmark in 201888 The development of Best Available Techniques (BAT) Reference Documents (BREFs) and BAT Conclusions ensures good collaboration with stakeholders and enables better implementation of IED89. Since the last EIR report, BAT Conclusions were adopted for waste incineration, for the food, drink and milk industries and for surface treatment using organic solvents including wood and wood products preservation with chemicals. The Commission relies on the efforts of national competent authorities to implement the legally binding BAT conclusions and associated BAT emission levels in environmental permits, resulting in considerable and continuous reduction of pollution. On 16 November 2021, Denmark hosted the EIR peer to peer workshop on ammonia reducing technology and measures. In 2019, Denmark had priority actions to review permits to comply with new adopted BAT conclusions and to step up control and enforcement to ensure compliance with BAT conclusions. These actions have been followed up by the Commission through the reporting by Denmark to the EU Registry. The Commission is currently verifying with Denmark the reported information on the permits granted for each installation in the scope of the IED. Major industrial accidents prevention – SEVESO The main objectives of EU policy on the prevention of major industrial accidents are to: (i) control major accident hazards involving dangerous substances, especially chemicals; (ii) limit the consequences of such accidents for human health and the environment; 88 EEA, EU Registry, European Industrial Emissions Portal (data retrieved on 3 November 2021). 89 European Commission BAT reference documents Denmark 22 Environmental Implementation Review 2022 – Denmark (iii) continuously improve prevention, preparedness and response to major accidents. The cornerstone of the policy is Directive 2012/18/EU (the Seveso-III Directive)90. The overview below of industrial plants regulated by the Seveso-III Directive, hereafter ‘Seveso establishments’, is based on data reported to the eSPIRS database (2018)91 and the Denmark report on implementation of the Seveso-III Directive for the period 2015-201892. In Denmark, of the 122 Seveso establishments, 61 are categorised as lower-tier establishments (LTE) and 61 as upper-tier establishments (UTE) – based on the quantity of hazardous substances likely to be present. The UTE are subject to more stringent requirements. The number of Seveso establishments is given in Figure 23. Figure 23: Number of Seveso establishments in Denmark, 2011, 2014 and 201893 According to Denmark, an external emergency plan (EEP) is required for 61 UTE. In 2018, 61 UTE had an EEP and 55 of these EEP had been tested over the last three years. The summary is shown in Figure 24. The establishment of EEPs is essential to allow proper preparation and effective implementation of the necessary actions to protect the environment and the population should a major industrial accident nevertheless happen. 90 Directive 2012/18/EU on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances. 91 European Commission, Seveso Plants Information Retrieval System 92 As provided for by Article 21(2) of the Seveso-III Directive 93 European Commission, Assessment and summary of Member States’ implementation reports for Implementing Decision 2014/896/EU (implementing Directive 2012/18/EU on the control of major accident hazards involving dangerous substances), 2022.

Denmark 23 Environmental Implementation Review 2022 – Denmark Noise The Environmental Noise Directive96 provides for a common approach to avoid, prevent and reduce the harmful effects of exposure to environmental noise, although it does not set noise limits as such. The main instruments it uses in this respect are strategic noise mapping and planning. A relevant 2030 zero pollution action plan target is a reduction by 30% of the share of people chronically disturbed by transport noise compared to 2017. Excessive noise from aircraft, railways and roads is one of the main causes of environmental health‐related issues in the EU. It produces ischaemic heart disease, stroke, interrupted sleep, cognitive impairment and stress97. In Denmark, based on a limited set of data98, environmental noise is estimated to cause at least around 100 premature deaths and 400 cases of ischaemic heart disease annually99. Moreover, some 55 000 people suffer from disturbed sleep. In Denmark, the number of people exposed to noise increased by 15% between 2012 and 2017, based on reported data. Noise mapping of agglomerations, roads and railways is complete, and based on the latest full set of analysed information. Water quality and management EU legislation and policy requires that the impact of pressures on transitional, coastal and fresh waters (including surface and ground waters) be significantly reduced. Achieving, maintaining or enhancing a good status of water bodies as defined by the Water Framework Directive will ensure that EU citizens benefit from good quality and safe drinking and bathing water. It will further ensure that the nutrient cycle (nitrogen and phosphorus) is managed in a more sustainable and resource-efficient way. 96 Directive 2002/49/EC 97 WHO 2018, Environmental Noise Guidelines for the European Region. 98 For further information: European Environment Agency, Noise Fact Sheets 2021. 99 These figures are an estimation by the European Environmental Agency based on : (i) the data reported by Member States on noise exposure covered by Directive 2002/49/EC; (ii) ETC/ATNI, 2021, Noise indicators under the Environmental Noise Directive 2021: Methodology for estimating missing data, ETC/ATNI Report No 2021/06, European Topic Centre on Air Pollution, Transport, Noise and Industrial Pollution; (iii) the methodology for heaalculations, ETC/ACM, 2018, Implications of environmental noise on health and wellbeing in Europe, Eionet Report ETC/ACM No 2018/10, European Topic Centre on Air Pollution and Climate Change Mitigation. Water Framework Directive The Water Framework Directive100 is the cornerstone of the EU’s water policy in the 21st century101. This Directive along with other water-related directives102 set the framework for sustainable and integrated water management. The aim is to achieve a high level of protection of water resources, to prevent of further deterioration and to restore water to good status. By March 2022, all Member States have to report the third generation of river basin management plans (RBMPs) under the Water Framework Directive. The Commission will assess the reported status and progress, and will check how the findings identified in the assessment of the second RBMPs103 have been addressed. Denmark has not yet reported the third RBMPs. The Commission published in December 2021 the sixth Implementation Report104. It includes, an interim assessment on progress of the implementation of the programmes of measures and on monitoring of the new priority substances. The assessment report for Denmark105 showed that the planned and implemented measures in all four river basin districts (RBDs) contributed significantly to reaching the objectives of the Water Framework Directive in 2021. However, the pace had slowed in particular for planned measures related to wetlands, hydromorphological changes on rivers and lake restorations. In Denmark, 70 research projects took place in the 2nd management cycle to better identify pressure factors, potential areas for action and their significance for achieving the environmental objectives106. 100 Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC). 101 EU Water Policy. 102 This includes the Groundwater Directive (2006/118/EC), the Environmental Quality Standards Directive (2008/105/EC), the Floods Directive (2007/60/EC), the Bathing Water Directive (2006/7/EC), the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (91/271/EEC), the new Drinking Water Directive (2020/2184/EC), the Nitrates Directive (91/676/EEC), the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (2008/56/EC), the Industrial Emissions Directive (2010/75/EU) and the new Regulation on minimum requirements for water reuse (2020/741). 103 Detailed information can be found in the 5th Report from the Commission on the implementation of the Water Framework Directive and the Floods Directive, as well as in the 2019 EIR. 104 See the 6th Implementation Report of the Water Framework Directive and Floods Directive. 105 European Commission, Directorate-General for Environment, Assessment of Member States’ progress in Programmes of Measures during the second planning cycle of the Water Framework Directive.

Denmark 24 Environmental Implementation Review 2022 – Denmark Based on the second RBMPs reporting and data published in 2020107, in Denmark 28.2% of all surface water bodies108achieved good ecological status (with unknown status 23.8%) and only 0.8% were in good chemical status (with 98.5% unknown). For groundwaters, 25.1% did not achieve good chemical status (30.6% were in unknown status) and 0.7% were in a poor status. Figure 26 illustrates the proportion of surface water bodies in Denmark and other European countries that failed to achieve good ecological status. Figure 26. Proportion of surface water bodies (rivers, lakes, transitional and coastal waters) in less than good ecological status per River Basin District109 Figure 27 presents the percentage of surface water bodies in Denmark and other European countries failing to achieve good chemical status. For Denmark, the percentage is 0.7%, including water bodies failing due to substances behaving as ubiquitous PBTs (persistent, bio-accumulative, or toxic). Excluding uPBTs, the percentage of surface water bodies that did not achieve good chemical status is unknown. 107 WISE Freshwater (europa.eu) 108 river, lake, transitional, coastal, territorial 109 EEA, 2021. Figure 27. Percentage of surface water bodies not achieving good chemical status110 Under the IED framework, Denmark achieved a significant decrease the last decade (20.1%) in industrial releases of heavy metals such as Cd, Hg, Ni, Pb and an increase (21.4%) in total organic carbon (TOC) to water111. The total volume of water abstracted annually in Denmark from surface and groundwater sources in 2018 was 868.77 hm3112. By sector, the percentage of water abstraction was 56.86% for agriculture, 40.56% for public water supply, 0.07% for electricity cooling, 1.53% for manufacturing and 0.97% for mining and quarrying, as illustrated in Figure 28. It should be noted that 2018 was a particularly dry year, so the amount of water used for agriculture was higher than normal. Denmark uses a register to monitor water abstractions. All water abstractions require a permit, except for a broad owner's abstraction of surface water for cattle, under the Danish Water Supply Act. 110 EEA, December 2019. 111 EEA, 2021 112 EEA, 2022. Denmark 25 Environmental Implementation Review 2022 – Denmark Figure 28: Water abstraction per sector in Denmark113 In Denmark, the water exploitation index plus (WEI+)114 was 1.49% in 2017, far less than the 20% that is generally considered as an indication of water scarcity115 (Figure 29); Denmark is ranked 18th (from high to low score) in the EU level in terms of WEI+ . Figure 29: Water exploitation index plus (WEI+) inside EU, 2017116 Denmark has taken several measures (smart meters, intelligent pumps, intelligent valves, deployed noise loggers and much more) to reduce the level of non-revenue water (NRW), including creating an economic incentive for water utilities to keep their NRW level below 10%. Denmark has also taken action to create awareness of the importance of saving water. As a result, Denmark has managed to reduce its water consumption by over 40% since 1980. Doing so means that Denmark has achieved one of the world's lowest levels of NRW with a consistent national average of just 6 to 8% compared to some parts of the world where NRW is over 50%. Water loss has been kept low through systematic leakage detection and by implementing modern ICT tools 113 European Environment Agency, Water abstraction by source and economic sector in Europe, 2022. 114 EEA, Water exploitation Index Plus, 2022. The Water Exploitation Index plus (WEI+) is a measure of total fresh water use as a percentage of the renewable fresh water resources (groundwater and surface water) at a given time and place. It quantifies how much water is abstracted and how much water is returned after use to the environment. 115 Eurostat 116 EEA, Water exploitation Index Plus, 2022. to assist NRW performance monitoring and reporting Another good practice in Denmark is the Water Valley initiative for water technology that will enable water consumption to become more resource efficient, cost effective and quality assured117. Floods Directive As mentioned, the Commission published in December 2021 the sixth Implementation Report. It includes the review and update of the Preliminary Flood Risk Assessments during the second cycle (2016-2021). The assessment report showed that in Denmark, the information provided in the Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment document in combination with the methodology report was informative and clear. Denmark also applied clear methodology to calculate APSFRs118 using a spatial process to rank areas of flood risk, factoring in climate change. However, pluvial floods should be also considered – at least in areas with high vulnerabilities. Denmark has made an attempt to overcome data scarcity for past fluvial flood events by conducting a survey amongst municipalities. Denmark has not yet adopted and reported the second generation of flood risk management plans (FRMPs) under the Floods Directive. The European Commission will assess progress since the adoption of the first flood risk management plans and publish a report. Drinking Water Directive As regards the Drinking Water Directive119, no new assessment of the quality of Drinking Water is available since the EIR 2019. The quality of drinking water in Denmark has not been indicated as an area of concern120. The recast Directive 121entered into force on 12 January 2021, Member States have until 12 January 2023 to transpose it into their national legal system. Denmark will have to comply with these reviewed quality standards. 117 Water Valley Denmark 118 Areas of Potential Significant Flood Risk 120The latest report for 2017-2019 by the Danish Environmental Protection Agency was based on analysis of water from supplies of water surpassing 1,000 m3 a day on average or serving more than 5,000 people. The controls showed that majority of biological and chemical parameters were close to or 100% compliance. For the microbiological parameters deviations were mainly observed for coliform bacteria and colony count 22 ˚C, in 1-4 % of the per-formed analyses. For the chemical parameters deviations were mainly observed for colour, turbidity, NVOC, ammonium, iron, manganese and nitrite, where 1-8 % of the performed analyzes deviated from the standard values. Denmark 26 Environmental Implementation Review 2022 – Denmark Bathing water Regarding the Bathing Water Directive, Figure 30 shows that in 2020, of the 1 026 Danish bathing waters, 90.7% were of excellent quality122. The evolution is shown in Figure 31. Figure 30: Bathing water quality in Europe in the 2020 season123 Figure 31: Bathing water quality 2017-2020124 Nitrates Directive The latest Commission Report on the Implementation of the Nitrates Directive, referring to the period 2016- 122 EEA, 2021. State of bathing waters in 2020 – Denmark country report. 123 EEA, Bathing Water Quality in 2020, 2022. 124 EEA, European Bathing Water Quality in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020. 2019125, warns that nitrates are still polluting water in the EU and causing harm. Excessive nitrates in water are harmful both to human health and to ecosystems, causing oxygen depletion and eutrophication. Where national authorities and farmers have cleaned up waters, it has had a positive impact on drinking water supply and biodiversity, and on sectors such as fisheries and tourism that depend on them. Nevertheless, excessive fertilisation remains a problem in many parts of the EU. Denmark has received a derogation under the Nitrates Directive for the application of more than 170 kg/ha of nitrogen from manure until 31 July 2024126. According to the last report on the implementation of the Nitrates Directive127, between periods 2008-11 and 2016-19, groundwater quality has slightly improved as compared to the previous reporting period, with the percentage of stations reaching or exceeding 40 or 50mg nitrate per litre that falling from 6.9% to 6.7% and from 19.3% to 14.3%, respectively. The situation concerning nitrates concentrations in surface water is stable with some improvements recorded in reducing of eutrophication. However, nutrient inputs to the Baltic Sea around Denmark however have significantly decreased for nitrogen in the Danish Straits and Kattegat, and for phosphorus in Kattegat128. In 2020, the government reached a new agreement on nitrogen129. In 2021, this was followed up by a deal on the green transition of Danish agriculture130. Improving the nitrogen and phosphorus cycles helps improve the circularity of the economy. Nevertheless, the Commission is aware of the challenges that the nutrient surplus in Denmark poses on the local environment and for the Baltic Sea. It will continue its structured dialogue with the Danish authorities to ensure that appropriate measures are taken to implement EU legislation131. However latest data for 2010-2020 shows increases in pollutant releases to water of 35.5% for nitrates, 30.8% for phosphorus and 21.4 for TOC132. Urban wastewater treatment Regarding the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive, in Denmark, the compliance rate is 99% much higher than the EU average of 76% in 2018133. Further action is 125 European Commission, Implementation Report 2016-2019. 126 European Commission, Derogation 17.07.2020. 127 European Commission, Annex 15 of the Staff Working Document accompanying the report on the implementation of the Nitrates Directive for the period 2016-2019 128 Commission Recommendations for Denmark’s CAP Plan, 2021, p.15 129 Danish government, Agreement on nitrogen efforts in 2020 130 Deal on green transition of Danish agriculture 131 European Parliament petition: 0862/2021 132 EEA, Water pollutant releases changes from 2010 to 2020 for the EU Member States, 29.03.2022. 133 WISE Denmark 27 Environmental Implementation Review 2022 – Denmark needed to provide biological treatment to additional 0.02 million p.e of urban wastewater (0.2%) and biological treatment with nitrogen and phosphorus removal to additional 0.07 million p.e. of urban wastewater (0.7%) (see Figure 32). Figure 32: Proportion of urban waste water that meets all requirements of the UWWTD (collection, biological treatment, biological treatment with nitrogen and/or phosphorus removal) in compliant urban areas of the UWWTD (‘compliance rate’), 2018134 In the 2019 EIR Denmark had four priority actions. The first was to take steps to improve monitoring of surface waters and the second was to complete the development of assessment methods for biological quality elements. The Commission cannot evaluated this until Denmark submits the third RBMP. The third priority action was to adopt legislation on nutrient pollution from agriculture to address environmental pressures and water quality issues; Denmark has done so. The fourth 2019 priority action was to integrate flood risk management cycles amongst various levels of administration. 2022 priority actions  Maintain progress to reduce agricultural pollution. Chemicals The EU seeks to ensure that chemicals are produced and used in a way that minimises any significant adverse effects on human health and the environment. In October 2020, the Commission published its chemicals strategy for sustainability - 'Towards a Toxic-Free Environment'135 which led to some systemic changes in EU chemicals legislation. The strategy is part of the EU's zero-pollution ambition – a key commitment of the European Green Deal. 134 European Commission, WISE Freshwater, 2021. 135 COM(2020) 667 final. The EU’s chemicals legislation136 provides baseline protection for human health and the environment. It also ensures stability and predictability for businesses operating within the internal market. The Commission has collected information on the enforcement of REACH and CLP since 2007. In December 2020, the Commission assessed the Member States reports on implementation and enforcement of these Regulations137, in line with REACH Article 117(1) and CLP Article 46(2). According to the latest available data, national enforcement structures have not changed much. However, it is apparent from this report that there are still many disparities in implementing REACH-CLP and notably in the area of the law enforcement. The recorded compliance levels seem to be quite stable over time, but they have worsened slightly possibly due to enforcement authorities being more effective in detecting noncompliant products/companies and more non-compliant products being put on the EU market. In August 2021, the Commission published a measurable assessment of the enforcement138 of the two main EU regulations on chemicals using a set of indicators tracking different aspects of enforcement. In Denmark, responsibility for checking compliance with REACH lies with the Danish Environmental Protection Agency139: As a rule, all infringements of REACH are classed as serious or very serious environmental administrative offences. If the infringement is sufficiently serious, the competent authority may decide to impose further penalties in addition to a fine. Where necessary, it may also order the provisional seizure of assets and documents. In Denmark 4.5 person years are allocated to REACH and CLP enforcement140. The enforcement strategy is based on risk-based prioritisation to focus on areas with the highest risk of a breach, and areas where breaches can lead to serious risk to health and the environment. Denmark was below the EU average in the % of non-compliance cases in 2019141 (see Figure 33). 136 REACH: OJ L 396, 30.12.2006, p.1. - CLP: OJ L 252, 31.12.2006, p.1 s. 137 European Commission, Final Report, on the operation of REACH and CLP, Final report_REACH-CLP MS reporting_2020.pdf (europa.eu) 138 European Commission, REACH and CLP enforcement: EU level enforcement indicators 139 European Commission, Final Report, on the operation of REACH and CLP, p. 68 140 European Commission, Final Report, on the operation of REACH and CLP, p. 74. 141 European Commission, Final Report, on the operation of REACH and CLP, p. 78 Denmark 28 Environmental Implementation Review 2022 – Denmark Figure 33: Percentage % of non-compliance cases out of the total number of REACH and CLP controls during 2019 per Member State and compared to the EU average142 In 2021, Denmark reached a political agreement on a strategy on pesticides143. This was followed up in early 2022, with an agreement on biocides in agriculture144 and on a chemicals strategy145. 2022 priority actions  upgrade the implementation and enforcement administrative capacity toachieve a zero tolerance for non-compliances. 142 European Commission, Final Report, on the operation of REACH and CLP , pp.87-88, 2022. 143 Political agreement on a pesticide strategy 2022-26 144 Political agreements on concerted Danish efforts on biocides 2022-25 145 Agreement on initiatives on chemicals Denmark 29 Environmental Implementation Review 2022 – Denmark 4. Climate action In line with the Paris Agreement and as part of the European Green Deal, the European Climate Law sets the EU target of reaching climate neutrality by 2050 and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 55% by 2030 compared to 1990. The law also limits the contribution that carbon removals can make towards emission reductions in 2030 to ensure a sufficient mitigation effort. The EU and its Member States submitted updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the UNFCCC in December 2020. The EU is working across all sectors and policies to cut GHG emissions and make the transition to a climate-neutral and sustainable economy, as well as addressing the unavoidable consequences of climate change. EU climate legislation incentivises emissions reductions from power generation, industry, transport, the maritime sector and fluorinated gases (F-gases) used in products. For road transport, EU legislation requires the GHG intensity of vehicle fuels to be cut by 6% by 2020 compared to 2010146 and sets binding GHG emission standards for different vehicle categories147. Under the F-gas Regulation, the EU’s F-gas emissions will be cut by two thirds by 2030 compared with 2014 levels. From 2021, emissions and removals of GHGs from LULUCF have been included in the EU emission-reduction efforts. The EU adaptation policy is an integral part of the European Green Deal. From 2021, Member States are required to report on their national adaptation policies148, as the EU Climate Law recognises adaptation as a key component of the long-term global response to climate change. Member States will be required to adopt national strategies, and the EU will regularly assess progress as part of its overall governance on climate action. The updated EU adaptation strategy, published in February 2021, sets out how the EU can adapt to the unavoidable impacts of climate change and become climate resilient by 2050. Key national climate policies and strategies In December 2019, Denmark adopted its integrated national energy and climate plan (NECP) for the 2021-2030 period covering decarbonisation, deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency. The plan will contribute to Denmark’s domestic objective to reduce 146 The Fuel Quality Directive (Directive 98/70/EC) sets strict quality requirements for fuels used in road transport in the EU to protect human health and the environment, and to make road travel across the EU safer. 147 Directive 98/70/EC. 148 Article 29 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. greenhouse gas emissions by 70% by 2030 (relative to 1990) and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 at the latest. In its RRP Denmark allocates 59% of available resources to climate objectives and outlines crucial reforms and investments including in relation to sustainable transport and clean and efficient production and on energy efficiency in public buildings and households. A green tax reform is also being implemented (more details in section 5). Denmark’s first national adaptation strategy was adopted in March 2008. It is based on the principle that all parts of society contribute to climate adaptation. Between 1990 and 2020, economy wide greenhouse gas emissions in Denmark fell by 41%. Danish greenhouse gas emissions per person are close to the EU average (see Figure 34). Figure 34: Total greenhouse gas emissions (incl. international aviation) in Denmark, 1990-2020 Effort sharing For emissions not covered by the EU ETS, Member States have binding national targets under the Effort Sharing legislation149. Denmark’s target is to reduce emissions not covered by the EU emissions trading system (such as buildings, road transport, agriculture, small industry and waste) by 20% by 2020 and by 39% by 2030, relative to the 2005 levels. Denmark has met its 2020 target (see Figure 35). 149 Regulation (EU) 2018/842. This is for sectors currently not covered by the existing EU emissions trading sector (typically emissions from the buildings, road transport, small industry, waste, agriculture and non-CO2 emissions from other sectors). The proposed national target will continue to cover this scope. Denmark 30 Environmental Implementation Review 2022 – Denmark According to its NECP, Denmark intends to achieve reductions in line with its current Effort Sharing target for 2030. Figure 35: Emissions and targets under the Effort Sharing Decision/ Effort Sharing Regulation in Denmark 2020 and 2030 as percentage change from 2005 Figure 36: Emissions, annual emission allocations (AEAs) and accumulated surplus/ deficit of AEAs under the Effort Sharing Decision in Denmark 2013-2020 Key sectoral developments In 2019, road transport in Denmark accounted for 26% of greenhouse gas emissions. Little progress has been made in reducing emissions from fuels and cars; compared to 2005 emissions, it only decreased by 2%. The greenhouse gases (GHG) intensity of vehicle fuels in Denmark decreased by 2.7% from 2010 to 2019. The country needs to act swiftly to meet the current reduction target of 6% by 2020. In 2020 Denmark increased its blending mandates for the road transport sector, and by 2022 legislation has been altered to a greenhouse reduction target, which also aims to reduce the global emissions of the used bio and renewable fuels. The greenhouse gas reduction target is set to further increase in 2025, 2028 and 2030, and by 2025 the Danish government will include indirect land use criteria (ILUC), to further reduce the global impact of the use of biofuels. The Danish government presented a specific transport plan to tackle key road congestion problems and has taken action to roll out the European Rail Traffic Management System signalling on Danish railroads, which is a prerequisite for more frequent train schedules and for further electrification of the rail network. The plan also foresees investments in public transport and cycling. The Danish government also aims to phase out the sale of new traditional diesel and petrol cars as of 2030 and to increase the sale of electric vehicles. Figure 37: Greenhouse gas emissions by sector in Denmark150 – historical emissions 1990-2020, projections 2021-2030151 On buildings, it is crucial to increase energy efficiency in order to reach climate goals. In agriculture, further measures are needed to reduce emissions, both CO2 and non-CO2 emissions. Figure 37 shows emission trends by sector. In the land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector, Denmark projects moderate net emissions by 2030. The quantities reported under the Kyoto Protocol for the LULUCF sector in Denmark show net emissions of, on average, 1.8 Mt CO2-eq for the period 2013 to 2019. In this regard, Denmark represents -0.5% of the annual average sink of -344.9 Mt CO2-eq of the EU-27. Accounting for the same period gives net average annual 150 The sectors in the figure correspond to the following IPCC sectors: Energy supply: 1A1, 1B and 1C.

Denmark 31 Environmental Implementation Review 2022 – Denmark credits of -5.4Mt CO2-eq, which corresponds to 4.7% of the EU-27 accounted sink of -115.0 Mt CO2-eq. There is an overall increasing pattern of reported net emissions. Accounted net credits show no clear trend. Denmark is one of three EU Member States with average net emissions and one of six EU Member States that show net emissions for at least one year (see Figure 38). Figure 38: Reported and accounted emissions and removals from LULUCF in Denmark152 Use of revenues from the auctioning of EU ETS allowances Total revenues from auctioning of emission allowances under the EU ETS over the years 2012-2021 exceeded EUR 1.1 billion. 100 % of auctioning revenue was spent on climate and energy purposes. In Denmark, revenues are not earmarked, for example projects have reported up to 100% of revenue each year. 2022 priority actions  further invest in the electricity grid network to ensure that the increasing share of renewable energy can be used efficiently, for example, on system flexibility, smart grids and storage. 152 The differences between reported and accounted emissions from LULUCF under the Kyoto Protocol are described in the ‘explanatory note on LULUCF – accounted and reported quantities under the Kyoto Protocol’. Denmark 32 Environmental Implementation Review 2022 – Denmark Part II: Enabling framework: implementation tools 5. Financing Environmental investment needs in the European Union Financing environmental measures is essential for their success. Although most financing comes from national sources, various EU funds contribute significantly, helping to close the financing gaps. Post-2020, environmental implementation will also be supported by the EU’s COVID-19 Recovery Fund (via the RRF) and the ‘do no significant harm’ principle which runs across the EU budget. The renewed commitments made at COP26 (Glasgow, October-November 2021) and the Biodiversity Convention (April-May 2022)153 will also be reflected in the EU budget. Overall environmental investment gaps (EU27) The EU’s green transition investment needs cover a range of interlinked areas. The additional investment needs in addition to the baseline figures (i.e. the gap between what is needed and what is forecast to be invested if no additional action is taken) for climate, energy and transport were estimated at EUR 390 billion per year (EU27)154, with a further EUR 130 billion needed to achieve the EU's core environmental objectives155. Climate adaptation costs can also be significant, reaching a total of EUR 35-62 billion (narrower scope) or EUR 158-518 billion (wider scope) per year156. Those investment needs to reflect the implementation objectives for 2020 to 2030 (except for climate adaptation the costs of which are expected to be spread over a longer time horizon). A preliminary update of the EU’s core environmental investment gap is provided in Table 1157. Almost 40% of the environmental investment needs relate to dealing with pollution, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the 153 The Convention on Biological Diversity 154 SWD(2021)621 155 SWD(2020) 98 final/2 156 SWD(2018)292. 157 With decreases due to Brexit and some reconciliation among the objectives.

The investment gap in circular economy and waste is estimated to be between EUR 13-28 billion per year, depending on levels of circularity implemented. The annual biodiversity financing gap is estimated at around EUR 20 billion.

To fully cover the strategy (including restoration) EUR 30-35 billion may be needed, indicating a gap of EUR 10-20 billion a year compared to the current baseline expenditure. Denmark 33 Environmental Implementation Review 2022 – Denmark a core policy priority. The following environmental investment needs have been identified by sector. Pollution prevention & control The EU’s First Clean Air Outlook160 under the clean air programme estimated that the total air pollution control costs for Denmark to reach the NECD Emission Reduction Requirements 161 by 2030 amount to EUR 1 113 million per year, including EUR 807 million for capital investment (assuming it meets its 2030 climate and energy targets)162. The Second EU’s Clean Air Outlook163 suggests that, if all relevant legislation adopted up to 2018 (including all air pollution and the 2030 climate and energy targets set in 2018) delivered their full benefits and if Member States also implemented the measures announced in their NAPCPs, the EU would largely achieve the reductions of air pollutant emissions that correspond to the obligations under the NECD for 2030, except for ammonia (NH3) emissions in 15 Member States, including Denmark. Water management According to the OECD164, in Denmark surface water is scarce. As a result, groundwater is the main source of drinking water. Although Denmark has abundant groundwater resources, some regions experience pressure on groundwater. Urbanisation and a significant increase in demand for irrigation will increase competition for water resources, including groundwater. Intrusion of saltwater from sea level rise may affect the quality of groundwater. Despite high levels of expenditure on water supply and sanitation, there remains a small compliance gap with wastewater treatment. EU funding has provided a significant share of past public funding over the past decade. It is also estimated that Denmark will need to invest an additional cumulative EUR 1 938 million by 2030 for drinking water and sanitation over current spending levels, corresponding to a need of around EUR 190 million investment (capital expenditure) per year, most of which (over 90%) for wastewater)165.

Country Fact Sheet Denmark, Country Fact Sheet Denmark, Page 4 sixth Water Framework Directive and Floods Directive166 Implementation Report and the financial - economic study167 accompanying it, are also a relevant source of information in this domain. Waste & the circular economy According to a Commission study168 to meet the recycling targets for municipal waste and packaging waste, Denmark still needs to invest an additional EUR 290 million (around EUR 41.5 million per year) between 2021-2027 in collection, recycling reprocessors, biowaste treatment, waste sorting facilities and waste registry digitalisation. Of this, biowaste treatment facility replacement costs are EUR 26 million for 2021-27 (or 3.7 million per year). This does not include investment necessary for other key waste streams (plastics, textiles, furniture) or to unlock a higher uptake of circularity and waste prevention across the economy. Biodiversity and ecosystems The prioritised action framework (PAF) adopted by the Member States under Article 8 of the Habitats Directive present the conservation priorities for the Natura 2000 network and its supporting green infrastructure, their costs and planned funding sources for the current budget (2021-2027). Denmark has not yet submitted a finalised PAF, which was expected by the end of 2021169. To note that PAF costs exclude the additional costs to implement the biodiversity strategy to 2030, for instance on increased protection and restoration. EU environmental funding 2014-2020 The multiannual financial framework (MFF) for the years 2014-2020 allocated almost EUR 960 billion (in commitments, 2011 prices)170 for the EU. The commitment to achieving the green transition included a 166 Water Framework Directive and Floods Directive Implementation Reports – DG Environment – European Commission. 167 European Commission, Directorate-General for Environment, Economic data related to the implementation of the WFD and the FD and the financing of measures, Final report, 2021. 168 European Commission, Study on investment needs in the waste sector and on the financing of municipal waste management in Member States, 2019, p.61. This is an EU-wide study; a caveat to attach to reasoning in the paragraph is that the level of recycling in Denmark is not directly linked to the level of investments in recycling plants in Denmark.

The 2014-2020 budget was subsequently topped up with over EUR 50 billion (current prices) from REACT-EU programme for cohesion policy action against coronavirus (COVID-19)172. Denmark received EUR 1 955.6 million from the ESI funds over 2014-2020 to invest in job creation and a sustainable and healthy economy and environment. Planned direct environmental investment amounted to EUR 180.1 million with a further EUR 32.9 million identified as indirect environmental investment value, totalling EUR 213 million (Table 2). Figure 39 gives an overview of (planned) individual ESI funds earmarked specially for Denmark (EU amounts, without national amounts) for the 2014-2020 period and the environmental investments it comprises. REACT-EU investments are focused on green technologies and addressing climate change (carbon capture). 171 The European Structural and Investment (ESI) funds include the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the Cohesion Fund (CF) which does not apply to Denmark, the European Social Fund (ESF) with the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI), the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF). 172 Regulation (EU) 2020/2221.

It finances demonstration and best practices to prepare the roll-out ofgreen solutions. Between 2014-2020 period, Denmark received EU funding for 11 LIFE projects (for nature and environment) with EUR 49 million from the LIFE programme (out of 1 028 EU27 LIFE projects with a total EU contribution of EUR 1.74 billion). In 2014-2020, the Horizon 2020 programme allocated some EUR 53.6 million to Denmark for the environment, in particular, for climate action, the circular economy and natural resources, with a total environmental share of 3.1% from Denmark’s Horizon 2020 allocation176. Denmark did not use funding under the European Fund for Strategic Investments,for projects with a dedicated environmental objective177. The environment-related EIB loans to Denmark amounted to 0.5 million (supporting waste and water), out of an overall EUR 4.7 billion EIB lent to Denmark in the period178179. The country ranks 17 in size in terms of total EIB lending. In 2020, the EIB provided EUR 24.2 billion to fight climate change, 37% of its total financing and EUR 1.8 billion (3% of financing) for the environment180. 175 European Commission, LIFE Programme. 176 EASME 177 Approved and signed EFSI financing - EIB, 2015-2020 178 EIB loans in EU countries in 2014-2020. 179 EIB, Activity Report, 2021. 180 The EIB Group jointly works with the European Commission in implementing several programmes that finance environmental implementation: InvestEU, the successor of EFSI, Pillar II and III of the Just Transition Mechanism. The EIB Group is a key implementing partner for InvestEU with responsibility for managing 75% of the overall budget capacity of the mandate. EU environmental funding 2021-2027 The 2020 European Green Deal investment plan calls for upon EUR 1 trillion in green investments (public and private) by 2030. The EU’s multiannual budget for 2021-2027 and the NextGenerationEU (NGEU) Fund will mobilise EUR 2.018 trillion (in current prices) to support the COVID-19 recovery and the EU's long-term priorities, including environmental protection181. Following the EU Green Deal’s182 ‘do no harm’ pledge and the Interinstitutional Agreement on the 2021-2027 MFF183, 30% of the EU budget will support climate action efforts and 7.5% (as of 2024) and 10% (as of 2026) will support biodiversity. These latter targets require increased programming of financial resources for biodiversity, specifically under the 2021-2027 Cohesion policy and the 2023-2027 common agricultural policy. Sustainable finance significantly increases transparency on environmental sustainability (a goal promoted by the EU Taxonomy)184, strengthens non-financial reporting requirements and facilitates green bond issuance (by the EU green bond standard185). Reinforced by the renewed sustainable finance strategy (2020)186 it will increase investment flows to climate and environmental action. To help finance climate adaptation measures, the new strategy on adaptation to climate change187 can help close the insurance protection gap from climate-related events that are uninsured188. The EIB will align 50% of its lending with climate and environment by 2025189 with an EUR 250 billion contribution to the Green Deal investment plan by 2027.

A 59.5% share of RRF funding for Denmark relates to measures that do contribute to the country’s climate and environmental objectives. This puts Denmark among the top Member States (EU average: 45.3%). Denmark also stands above the 37% climate expenditure target, the minimum level required under the RRF Regulation (see Figure 40)198. The main green priorities under the RRP for Denmark are to achieve a green transition in agriculture, energy efficiency and green heating, green tax reform, sustainable transport and to fund green research and development. Overall, the plan ensures that direct actions can be taken at local level to contribute to the green transition, while protecting or restoring the environment, and in compliance with the Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) principle 199. 190 European Commission, 2021-2027 Cohesion policy EU budget allocations. 191N.B. it is expected to transfer EUR 106 million from ETC to ERDF giving a total of EUR 247.2 million. 192 European Commission, 2021-2027 Cohesion policy EU budget allocations. 193 European Commission, CAP strategic plans. 194 Regulation (EU) 2021/2115, Annex XI. 195 Regulation (EU) 2021/1139, Annex V. 196 The actual reforms and investments under the RRF must be implemented by 31 December 2026. 197 Council Implementinng Decision, FIN 515. 198 Regulation (EU) 2021/241. 199 COM(2021) 1054 final.

Denmark satisfies the enabling condition for a waste management plan allowing to fund investments in the circular economy. However, the enabling condition for a prioritised action framework for investments in nature and biodiversity is not fulfilled as a final version yet to be submitted. Under the NextGenerationEU Fund, the Commission will issue up to EUR 250 billion of EU green bonds (one third of the NGEU) until 2026 that meet the general spirit of the DNSH principle. But this will not be subject to the current delegated acts on the EU Taxonomy and will not fully align with the proposed EU green bond standard. In addition to EU funds earmarked specifically for Denmark in the 2021-2027 period, there are also funding programmes available at EU level and are open to all Member States. These include, among others, the LIFE programme201 (EUR 5.4 billion), Horizon Europe (EUR 95.5 billion)202, the Connecting Europe Facility203 (EUR 33.7 billion)204 and the funds due to be mobilised under 200 European Commission.

National environmental protection expenditure Total national spending on environmental protection (all current and capital expenditure)209 in the EU27 was EUR 272.6 billion in 2020, representing 2% of the common GDP and quite stable over time. Although in absolute figures expenditure is concentrated in a few countries , as a share of GDP, most countries spend between 1-2%; Denmark spends around 2%. Of the above total, the EU27’s capital expenditure (Capex) on environmental protection (i.e. investment) amounted to EUR 56.3 billion in 2018, falling to EUR 54.5 billion in 2020, representing around 0.4% of GDP. Most Member States invested 0.2-0.5% of their GDP in environmental protection. Denmark invested 0.4% of GDP in 2018. During 2014-2020, this totalled around EUR 376 billion of environmental investment in the EU27, and EUR 9.1 billion for Denmark (see Figure 41). 205 The InvestEU Fund is expected to mobilise over EUR 372 billion in investment through an EU budget guarantee of EUR 26.2 billion to back the investment of financial partners such as the EIB Group and others. 206 European Commission, Horizon Europe. 207 European Commission, Connecting Europe Facility. 208 European Union, InvestEU. 209 At economy level, including final consumption, intermediate consumption and capital expenditure of households, corporations and governments related to environmental protection goods and services.

At EU level, 37% comes from governments, 33% from specialist producers and 30% from industry (business). 210 Eurostat, Environmental Protection Expenditure Account, 2021. Denmark 38 Environmental Implementation Review 2022 – Denmark Figure 42: EU-27 Member States' environmental protection investments (Capex) by institutional sectors (Total economy = 100%), 2018211 A breakdown of investment by environmental topic is only partially available, at the level of institutional sectors (rather than at economy level), due to different reporting patterns212. At Denmark’s general government level, a significant share of environmental protection investments (around 60%) went on environmental research and development and 21% on biodiversity in 2018 (based on available data that are not comprehensive or fully validated). In terms of the country’s specialist producers, 76% of investment were received by wastewater and 24% by waste management bodies. In the business sector, 41% of investment went on air protection, 20% on wastewater and 9% on waste, the most significant areas of investment (see Figure 42). The total annual European green bond issuance in 2020 was USD 156 billion (EUR 137 billion213), rising from USD 117 billion (EUR 105 billion) in 2019, including some non-EU European countries. By EU27 Member States only 2020 annual green bond issuance was EUR 124 billion, including EUR 1.95 billion issued by Denmark. 83% of the green bonds issued by European countries served energy, buildings or transport objectives between 2014-2020, 8% supported water and waste, and an additional 6% for land use – with links to ecosystem conservation & 211 Eurostat, Environmental Protection Expenditure Accounts (env_epe). 212 Data reporting differs for the three institutional sectors, leading to aggregation difficulties. Specialist companies provide comprehensive data across all environmental areas (CEPA 1-9), while this is less the case for general government and industry that often report (the non-obligatory) data in merged categories only (making it difficult to provide a breakdown) or not at all. 213 At Eurostat’s annual average EUR/USD exchange rates. restoration, based on the Climate Bonds Taxonomy being broadly similar to the EU Taxonomy214 (see Figure 43). Figure 43: Annual EU green bond issuance in 2020 (EUR billion)215 Green budget tools Green taxation and tax reform In absolute terms, Denmark’s revenue from environmentally related taxes remains around the EU average in 2020, as shown in Figure 44. Within this, energy and transport taxation represent the highest share with 52.2% and 42.5% in 2020, while pollution/resource tax accounted for 5.3%. In terms of % of GDP, environmental taxes accounted for 3.17% in 2020, the third highest in the EU (EU average is 2.24 %). 214 Interactive Data Platform at www.climatebonds.net.

Denmark 39 Environmental Implementation Review 2022 – Denmark Figure 44: Environmental taxes in the EU-27, 2020216 The 2019 European Green Deal underlines that well-designed tax reforms can boost economic growth and resilience, foster a fairer society and a just transition, by sending the right price signals and incentives to economic actors. The Green Deal creates the context for broad-based tax reforms, for the removal of fossil fuel subsidies, shifting the tax burden from labour to pollution, and for factoring in social considerations217. The application of the ‘polluter pays principle’ 218 stipulating that polluters should bear the cost of measures to prevent, control and remedy pollution is facilitated by the EU Commission’s TSI flagship on greening taxes. In Denmark there are many examples of green tax reform219, notably on phosphorus and pesticides. Denmark could consider bringing in a system of tradable livestock rights to reduce ammonia. Environmentally-harmful subsidies Addressing and removing environmentally harmful subsidies is a further step towards wider fiscal reforms220. Fossil fuel subsidies are costly for public budgets and undermin the achievement of the Green Deal objectives. In many cases they also go against incentives for green investments and distort the playing field. Fossil fuel subsidies fluctuate around EUR 55 billion in the EU since 216 Eurostat, Environmental taxes accounts (env_eta). 217 European Commission, The European Green Deal, COM (2019/640 final), p.17 218 Article 191(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union: “Union policy on the environment (…) shall be based on the precautionary principle and on the principles that preventive action should be taken, that environmental damage should as a priority be rectified at source and that the polluter should pay”. 219 European Commission, 2021, Ensuring that Polluters Pay - Denmark 220 European Commission, Study on assessing th environmental fiscal reform potential for the EU 28, 2016. 2015. They rose by 4% between 2015 and 2019, however some countries, such as Latvia, Lithuania Sweden, Greece or Ireland, managed to decrease them. In the EU, subsidies for petroleum products, in sectors such as transport and agriculture, continued to rise over this period, whereas subsidies on coal and lignite fell, largely owing to the falling role of solid fuels in electricity generation. As a share of GDP, fossil fuel subsidies ranged from 1.2% in Hungary to less than 0.1% in Luxembourg in 2019 (0.4% on EU average). Total fossil fuel subsidies amounted to EUR 1.4 billion in Denmark in 2019 – representing 0.4% of GDP (around the EU-average). In 2020, the total amount of fossil fuel subsidies fell to EUR 52 billion (due to falling consumption trends amid the COVID-19-related restrictions). Unless action is taken by the Member States , these subsidies are likely to rebound as economic activity picks up from 2020221. Further details of the situation in Denmark are shown in Figure 45.

Denmark 40 Environmental Implementation Review 2022 – Denmark elements.223 Green budgeting helps identify and track green expenditure and green revenues to increase transparency on the environmental implications of budgetary policies, improve policy coherence and supporting green policies (including climate and environmental objectives).224 The EU has also developed climate proofing and sustainability proofing guidance to assess project eligibility and compliance with environmental legislation and criteria.225 The European Commission drew up a green budgeting reference framework226 and launched a technical support flagship (TSI) on green budgeting in 2021 to assist Member States in drafting or developing national green budgeting frameworks to improve policy coherence and for the green transition. Denmark participated in the European Commission’s green budgeting project with a training 24 February 2022227. Denmark has a new macroeconomic model, GreenREFORM, under development (a dynamic computable general model). The aim with the model is to enable the fiscal and economic planning to support the green transition. The model is being developed by the independent governmental institution the DREAM group, and the project is primarily financed by the Danish Ministry of Finance, which also contributes to the model development and intends to implement and use the model when it is ready. The model is designed to assess the future economic and fiscal impacts of climate and environmental policies, and the climate and environmental impacts of economic policies. GreenREFORM describes the energy use and emission of pollutants in the energy and air emissions accounts produced by Statistics Denmark from all Danish businesses, households, and the public sector. The model also describes the effect on emissions from environmental taxes, subsidies, and other regulations. The model produces annual projections up to 2100, which aids medium-to-long-term fiscal and economic analysis. The projections enable an assessment of the effect of future economic developments on the climate and environment and whether these developments are consistent with climate and environmental targets. This functionality will enable Denmark to position climate and 223 European Commission, Green Budgeting Practices in the EU: A First Review, 2021.

Overall financing compared to the needs The overall environmental financing for investments is estimated to reach 0.6-0.7% of GDP in the 2014-2020 period in the European Union, taking into account major EU funds and national financing. This ranged from 0.3% (Ireland) to 1.91% (Bulgaria), linked to the level of environmental challenges in the Member States. In the 2021-2027 period, the overall EU environmental investment needs are estimated to range between 0.9-1.5% of the projected GDP (2021-2027), suggesting a potential environmental financing gap of 0.6-0.8% of GDP at EU level, previous financing levels maintained (see Figure 46)229. Figure 46: Total environmental financing baseline (2014-2020) and estimated needs (2020 - 2030) in the EU27 (% of GDP)230 Denmark’s environmental financing for investments is estimated to have been 0.57% of GDP in 2014-2020, almost exclusively from national sources.

It can be highlighted that, based on the data available, the share of private environmental financing in Denmark is high (over 80%) that can provide useful examples for other Member States on using more effectively the involvement of private financing. 231 European Commission, Sustainable product policy and design Denmark 42 Environmental Implementation Review 2022 – Denmark 6. Environmental governance Information, public participation and access to justice Citizens can more effectively protect the environment if they can rely on the three ‘pillars’ of the Aarhus Convention: (i) access to information; (ii) public participation in decision making; (iii) access to justice in environmental matters. It is of crucial importance to public authorities, the public and businesses that environmental information is shared efficiently and effectively232. Public participation allows authorities to make decisions that take public concerns into account. Access to justice is a set of guarantees that allows citizens and NGOs to use national courts to protect the environment233. It includes the right to bring legal challenges (‘legal standing’)234. Environmental information This section focuses on Denmark’s implementation of the INSPIRE Directive235. The aim of the INSPIRE (Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe)236 is to establish a European spatial data infrastructure to share environmental spatial information between public authorities across Europe, assist in policy-making across boundaries and facilitate public access to this information. Geographic information is needed for good governance at all levels and should be readily and transparently available. Denmark’s implementation of the INSPIRE Directive could be better. Slow progress has been made on data identification and documentation, and implementation levels are good. However, more efforts are needed to make data more widely accessible (see Table 4). Table 4: Country dashboard on the implementation of the INSPIRE Directive, 2016-2020237 232 The Aarhus Convention, the Access to Environmental Information Directive (Directive 2003/4/EC) and the INSPIRE Directive (Directive 2007/2/EC) together create a legal foundation for the sharing of environmental information between public authorities and with the public. This EIR focuses on the INSPIRE Directive's implementation. 233 These guarantees are explained in the Commission Notice on access to justice in environmental matters, OJL 275, 18.8.2017 and a related Citizen's Guide. 234 This EIR focuses on the means implemented by Member States to guarantee rights of access to justice, legal standing and to overcome other major barriers to bringing cases on nature and air pollution. 235 INSPIRE 236 INSPIRE 237 INSPIRE knowledge base Denmark, 2021. 2016 2020 Legend Effective coordination and data sharing ■ Implementation of this provision is well advanced or (nearly) completed.

Conformity of network services ■ ■ Denmark had a priority action in 2019 on the need to improve access to spatial data and services and make stronger links to the country INSPIRE portals, where some progress can be seen. Therefore no priority action is proposed in 2022. Public participation Planning authorities responsible for implementing Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) may be at national, municipality, or local level, depending on the nature of the project. The planning authority in question must publish the hearing on its own website, and the process may be conducted using the national portal “Høringsportalen”239. The long-term ambition is to make Høringsportalen a single point of entry for all public 238 In 2016, the deadlines for implementation of the spatial data interoperability were still in the future: 23.11.2017 for Annex I data and 21.10.2020 for Annex II and III data. This conformity indicator will in many cases never reach 100% as most countries provide as-is-data sets in addition to the INSPIRE harmonised data sets 239 Høringsportalen Denmark 43 Environmental Implementation Review 2022 – Denmark hearings in Denmark irrespective of the competent authority (government, national authorities, municipal councils etc.). Currently the use of the portal is only mandatory for state authorities in all EIA and Strategic Environment Assessment (SEA) procedures, and only for limited cases for municipalities and local authorities. The wide range of administrations responsible for EIA and SEA procedures results in a lack of available data at national level on public participation. Extending the use of the national portal would clearly facilitate data collation and publication on participation rates. As regards the EIA Directive, Denmark is currently subject to an infringement procedure240. The shortcomings include unclear national rules for adopting projects by legislative acts, incorrect application of the provisions governing consultation of the public and authorities and incorrect national provisions on the required content of development consent decisions. Access to justice Physical and legal persons, including NGOs, may challenge environmental adminsitrative decisions. The Danish Act on Environmental Assessment applies a very broad scope and definition for any type of plans or programmes, including informal plans or programmes. The administrative appeals boards provide information on how to submit an administrative appeal in environmental matters. In general, a digital platform must be used for administrative appeals. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also provides information on access to justice in environmental matters. In general, there are no options for administrative appeals regarding executive regulations and/or generally applicable legally binding normative instruments. If, however, such executive regulations are to be considered a plan or a programme falling under the scope of the SEA requirements under the Act on Environmental Assessment, the rules on administrative appeals in the Environmental Assessment Act will apply as regards the environmental assessment. There are no specific rules however on judicial review of executive regulations. The general rule on judicial review in Section 63 of the Danish Constitution also includes access to review executive regulations and their legality. Thus, executive regulations can only be challenged in courts e.g. as regards their legal basis in the relevant legislation and their compliance with EU law. 240 European Commission, October 2021_infringements_package__key_decisions It can be concluded that Denmark has a system of regular supervision of regulatory legally binding acts but it is hardly accessible for members of the public and NGOs, who can only call alert bodies or officials entitled to initiate an extraordinary supervision procedure. 2022 priority actions  make spatial data more widely accessible and prioritise environmental datasets in the implementation of the INSPIRE Directive, especially those identified as high-value spatial datasets for implementing environmental legislation;  improve access to courts by the public concerned when challenging administrative or regulatory decisions and omissions, in particular under water, nature and air quality;  consider collating and publishing data from Høringsportalen (national hearings portal) on public participation. Compliance assurance Environmental compliance assurance covers all the work undertaken by public authorities to ensure that industries, farmers and others fulfil their obligations to protect water, air and nature, and manage waste241. It includes support measures provided by the authorities such as: (i) compliance promotion 242; (ii) inspections and other checks that they carry out, i.e. compliance monitoring 243; (iii) the steps that they take to stop breaches, impose sanctions and require damage to be remedied, i.e. enforcement244. Citizen science and complaints enable authorities to focus their efforts better. Environmental liability245 ensures that the polluter pays to remedy any damage. Compliance promotion and monitoring Comprehensive information is available online on technical and regulatory aspects of the Nature Directives and the Nitrates Directive. In addition, the EPA has published guidance to help livestock farmers understand 241 The concept is explained in detail in the Communication on EU actions to improve environmental compliance and governance COM(2018)10 and the related Commission staff working document, SWD(2018)10. 242 This EIR focuses on the help given to farmers to comply with nature and nitrates legislation. 243 This EIR focuses on inspections of major industrial installations. 244 This EIR focuses on the availability of enforcement data and co-ordination between authorities to tackle environmental crime. 245 The Environmental Liability Directive, 2004/35, creates the framework. Denmark 44 Environmental Implementation Review 2022 – Denmark and comply with the environmental requirements of the Nitrates Directive246. Farmers can find guidance on matters such as permit requirements and other regulatory requirements, and administrative procedures, in a searchable format. Although government information on nature protection specifically aimed at farmers is limited, the EPA website on Natura 2000 includes a section addressed to landowners of Natura 2000 sites with a section about nature in agriculture247. Responsibility for permitting under the IED, and for monitoring compliance, is shared between the EPA, and municipalities, which are responsible for some specific categories of industry. The EPA sets out formal guidelines for inspections, including those carried out by municipalities. Information on inspections, including reports, and on other permitting activities is submitted to the EPA via its Digital Environmental Administration (DMA)248. Reports are not published, but may be requested by members of the public under freedom of information legislation. Denmark does not publish environmental statistics or annual activity reports linked to these environmental inspections. Complaint handling and citizen science The EPA has guidance on submitting complaints, and contact information, on its website249. The various departments are listed with links to their functions, contact information and opening hours. Information is also provided on the confidentiality and anonymity of complaints in order for citizens to feel safe in their communication with the authorities. There is also specific ‘whistleblower’ information for citizens who want to contact an authority anonymously250. The information on the EPA website is, however, brief and may not be easy for people to navigate. The Environment and Food Complaint Board has more detailed and accessible information on its website251. Most significantly it contains a ‘Klageportalen’ (Complaint Portal) that provides a secure access to submit complaints. The Board’s website also gives comprehensive guidance on the use of the Portal, and explains what happens after submitting a complaint252. Statistics on the use of public complaints or whistleblowing cases do not appear to be compiled. 246 Danish EPA Guidance on livestock farming 247 Nature in Agriculture f 248 Digital Environmental Administration 249 Contact the Danish Environmental Protection Agency 250 The Ministry of the Environment's handling of inquiries from citizens about possible offences 251Environment and Food Complaints Board 252 FAQ on “Klageportalen Enforcement Denmark does not keep a publicly available database of environmental prosecutions. The EPA formerly published an annual overview of environmental criminal cases but it has not provided this information for years. Cooperation and coordination among the Danish bodies responsible for tackling environmental crime appears to function well, despite the lack of formal agreements. The police have developed informal cooperation with the EPA to better prepare cases that are to be referred to them. The Director of Public Prosecutions Office runs courses on handling environmental crime cases, which it also makes available also to staff from the EPA, police, and courts service. Environmental Liability Directive (ELD) The EPA has a web page specifically for ELD cases253; although only two cases has been published so far, as only ‘serious’ damages are considered falling within the ELD. Prevention cases do not seem to be included. In each case, a full description of the investigation carried out and final decision are provided. Neither appear to have resulted in financial costs to the private sector. There does not appear to be an overview of environmental damage cases under other legislation. Denmark has not updated its legislation on financial security since the 2019 EIR, although some Danish insurance companies do offer cover for ELD liabilities. Furthermore, the Commission urged Denmark in 2019 to correctly incorporate rules on environmental liability into its national law, to ensure sufficient protection for the public. This case is now closed, but Denmark is still subject to an infringement procedure for failure to correctly transpose Article 12(1), first sub-paragraph of the ELD with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage as interpreted by the CJEU in Case C-529/15. In 2019 Denmark had four priority actions. The first was to better inform the public about compliance promotion, monitoring and enforcement, where there has been limited progress. The second and third were related to the ELD on extending insurance cover and improving financial security for liabilities and publishing information on environmental damage, where there has been limited progress. The fourth was on publishing information on the outcome of enforcement action and the follow-up of detected cross-compliance on breaches on nitrates and nature; here too there has been limited progress. 2022 priority actions 253 Environmental damage (Environmental Liability Directive) Denmark 45 Environmental Implementation Review 2022 – Denmark  improve the availability of practical information for farmers on compliance with the Nature Directives;  improve the publicly available information on the follow-up to complaints and to environmental inspections, including through the publication of regular summary data;  improve the information provided on ELD cases, including data on costs. Effectiveness of environmental administrations Those involved in implementing environmental legislation at EU, national, regional and local levels need to have the knowledge, tools and capacity to ensure that the legislation and the governance of the enforcement process bring about the intended benefits. Administrative capacity and quality Denmark ranks first out of 180 in the 2020 Environmental Performance Index254. At present, the number of complaints and infringements in the environmental field can be considered below the EU average. Denmark has an advanced use of digital or innovative solutions in environmental policy as mentioned under Compliance Assurance, under the Technical Support Instrument and also on water policy (see section 3). Coordination and integration As mentioned in the 2017 and 2019 EIR Reports, the transposition of the revised EIA Directive255 provided an opportunity to streamline the regulatory framework on environmental assessments. Denmark transposed the revised Directive; there is currently an infringement open, covering public consultation. The Commission encourages the streamlining of the environmental assessments in order to reduce duplication and avoid overlaps in environmental assessments applicable to projects. Moreover, streamlining helps reducing unnecessary administrative burden and accelerates decision-making, without compromising the quality of the environmental assessment procedure256. 254 Environmental Performance Index 255 Directive 2014/52/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 amending Directive 2011/92/EU on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment 256 The Commission issued a guidance document in 2016 on setting up coordinated and/or joint procedures that are simultaneously subject to assessments under the EIA Directive, Habitats Directive, Water In the 2019 EIR Denmark had a priority action on further improving its overall environmental governance. The evidence presented here is that there has been some progress, so no priority action is proposed for 2022. Reforms through the Commission’s technical support instrument The Commission supports environmental implementation and the green transition, not only through the EU financing programmess, but also granting technical assistance such as the technical support instrument (TSI). The Commission’s 2021 TSI supported a project related to energy transition in Denmark. Then under the TSI 2022, Denmark is running two projects of environmental relevance: i) the development of resilient, innovative and human centred digital government service, which is applied to the circular economy, and ii) the Digitilisation of the East Atlantic Flyway for birds in the Wadden Sea (together with Germany and The Netherlands). TAIEX EIR peer to peer projects The TAIEX EIR peer to peer tool257 has been launched by the Commission to facilitating peer-to-peer learning between environmental authorities. During the reporting period, Denmark has taken part in three TAIEX EIR multicountry workshop on EU Timber Regulation Nordic Baltic Competent Authorities (2019), ammonia reducing technology and measures (2021) and zero pollution (2022).

The More from Less report was followed by the 2019 EEA Report ‘ Resource \nefficiency and the circular economy in Europe 2019 – even more from less: An overview of the policies, \napproaches and targets of 32 European countries’ 2.\nIt presented an updated and extended assessment of approaches and identified trends, similarities and \nnew directions taken by countries in the connecte d policy areas of resource efficiency and the circular \neconomy. \nThese reports, comprising a compilation of extensive survey responses from countries, were accompanied \nby 32 country profiles. \nIn the second quarter of 2022 a new survey with questions and g uidelines was launched. Based on \ninformation reported by the Eionet network, in particular, the Eionet Group on Circular Economy and \nResource Use, and after review and editing by the European Topic Centre on Circular economy and \nresource use (ETC CE), the 30 2022 CE country profiles 3 were published alongside the EEA report ‘Circular \nEconomy policy innovation and good practice in Member States’ 4 (2022). \nThese 2024 CE country profiles are an update of the 2022 ones and based on the responses of 29 countrie s\nto the survey questions and guidelines that were launched in March 2024. The information in the \ncountries’ responses was again reviewed and edited by the European Topic Centre on Circular economy \nand resource use. A selection of Eurostat data was made to further complement these country profiles. \nThe main objectives of these assessments and its updates are to: • stimulate exchange of information and \nshare good practice examples among country experts; • support policymakers in Eionet countries, the \nEurope an institutions and international organisations by providing an updated catalogue of circular \neconomy actions being undertaken in European countries. \nThis circular economy country profile is based on information reported by the Eionet network and, in \npart icular, the Eionet Group members on Resource Efficiency and Circular Economy in the second quarter \nof 2024.

The Action Plan describes the \nDanish targets, indicators, policies and initiatives along the entire circular value chain, from design through \nconsumption to waste from which natural resources are recycled i nto new products and materials. In \naddition to several initiatives along the value chain in general, the Action Plan focusses on three areas with \nsignificant environmental and climate impact: biomass, construction and plastics . The Action plan for \nCircular Economy contains 129 national initiatives – many of which are still under implementation. At the \ntime of data collection , 79 initiatives had been completed, 20 were on schedule, 29 were delayed, and 1 \nhad been cancelled. \nA n ew initiative that ha s been implemented is the m andatory door -to -door collection of household textile \nwaste in all Danish municipalities from 1July 2023. Denmark has chosen to introduce this ahead of the EU -\nrequirement for 2025, and with a door -to -door collection or similar col lection systems close to the \nhouseholds in order to maximize the impact on recycling .\nIn Denmark, many of the initiatives regarding circular economy and waste prevention are housed in other \nministries than the Ministry of Environment.  The Danish Governmen t's Action Plan for Circular Economy \nhas initiatives run by 7 different ministries.  This contributes to a broad collaboration of actors and sectors .\nThere is still room for improvement in terms of adapting the institutional set -up to mainstream circularity \nfurther across sectors and actors. \nA noteworthy successful approach includes the new environmental and climate -economic -CGE -model \n“Green Reform” th at has been developed by the Danish Government 5. The model will be used to assess \nthe environmental impact of economic activity as well as the economic effects of environmental , energy \nand climate policies. Underpinning the impact assessments in GreenRefo rm is an LCA -based model, which \nwill enable the projections on the circular economy under different policy and technology scenarios. The \nmodel is dependent on Green National Accounts (following the UN standard) and is anchored in the \nMinistry of Finance – in cooperation with the relevant ministries (such as Environment, Food, Climate and \nTransport). \nCircular Cities \nThe Region of Central Denmark has participated in the Circular Cities And Regions Initiative (CCRI) . In \naddition , many Danish municipalities are ambitious when it comes to circular economy. For example, the \nmunicipality of Copenhagen has set circular economy targets in their “Resource and Waste Plan” for \n2024 (6).   \n\n5https://fm.dk/nyheder/nyhedsarkiv/2020/oktober/danmark -i-spidsen -for -internationalt -samarbejde -om -\ngroenne -regnemodeller/ (in Danish )\n6https://www.kk.dk/politik/politikker -og -indsatser/klima -og -miljoe/cirkulaer -koebenhavn -ressource -og -affaldsplan\n(in Danish)\nThe draft -version of the 2030 -plan for Copenhagen is available at\nhttps://www.kk.dk/sites/default/files/agenda/4c2ace22 -b3ad -4eae -8a00 -7fea405ffd51/c9f94d92 -06ad -4320 -8c91 -\ne6022 246f487 -bilag -2_0.pdf (in Danish)\n\nETC -CE Report 2024/Denmark 9\nCircular economy policy elements included in other policies \nCircular economy policy element  Included in policy \nStreamlined pictogrammes , sorting criteria and \ncollection schemes for household waste , including: \n\n\nMandatory waste pictograms for collection bins. \n\n\nMandatory sorting criteria for ten fractions of \n\n\nhousehold waste. \n\nPublic and private companies are also obliged to use \n\nthe same pictograms and sorting criteria for their \nmunicipal waste. \n\nDoor -to -door collections have become mandatory for \n\nten waste fractions – food, paper, cardboard, glass, \nmetal, plastics, food and drink cartons, textiles, \nhazardous waste and residual waste. \nClimate Plan for a Green Waste Sector and C ircular \nEconomy  (in Danish) \n\n\n15 initiatives to support the reduction of food waste \n\n\nThe initiatives are divided in the following 4 tracks: \n\n\ninvolvement of actors and simplification of rules across \nthe food value chain; more knowledge on effective \nmeans of action; communication and access to tools; \ninternational engagement \nDenmark’s national food waste st rategy 2024 -2027  (in \nDanish) \nSummary of strat egy and launch  (in Danish) \nNew requirements (01/07/24 + 1 year transition period) \non selective demolition when demolishing buildings \nwith a size of 250 m2 or more.

This framework provides a holistic view as it:  \n\n•\n\nmeasures direct and indirect benefits of 'becoming circular' and  \n\n•\n\nvalues the contribution of a circular economy in living well within the limits of the planet  \n\n•\n\naddresses energy and material supply risks. \nIt consists of 5 thematic sections with a total of 11 statistical indicators , some of which have additional \nsub -indicators. In some cases policy targets exist which should be achieved in the future, and the indicators \nmonitor progress towards these targets. The current mon itoring framework is a revision of the original \nframework which was set up in 2018. \nThis section elaborates on the assessment of Denmark its progress in terms of observed trends over the \nlast 5 years and what country characteristics or policy actions ma y explain differences between the country \nits performance and the average EU performance .\nProduction and consumption :\n• Material footprint has increased at a higher rate in 2021 compared to a more steady increase in \nthe previous years. It continues to be ab ove the EU average. \n• Waste generation has remained relatively steady and decreased from 2018 -202 27.\nWaste management :\n• The recycling rate of municipal waste has been increasing steadily, however between 2019 -2022 \nthere have been some fluctuations.

As such, there are no \nnational quantitative targets. \nDenmark is still awaiting data that can showcase the effects of the newly harmonised waste management \nsystem on recycling, which has been gradually impleme nted from 2021 to 2023. \nFurthermore, Denmark’s status on reaching the EU -defined circular economy targets is currently being \ncalculated using the new EU recycling rate methodology where technical adjustments are still being made. \nInnovative approaches and good practices\nExamples of public policy initiatives (national, regional or local) \n➔ Good practice example: Green/Circular/Sustainable public procurement \nMandatory use of ecolabels and total cost of ownership in public procurement (9)\nIn 2022 it became mandatory to choose an eco -labelled product or a product that meets similar \nrequirements when procuring for the state for product groups where the government assesses that there \nis adequate competition and no significant price difference. Initially, it will be mandatory for the following \nproducts t o be eco -labelled or meet similar requirements: paper and printed matter, cleaning and cleaning \nagents, soap and some hygiene products, standard batteries and indoor painting. The list of product \ngroups with requirements for eco -labelled procurement will be updated once a year and expanded on an \nongoing basis. \nFurthermore, the government is making it mandatory to use total cost of ownership (TCO) as an economic \nprice parameter in connection with state procurement where possible and appropriate. In this wa y, the \nfocus will shift from the acquisition price to costs throughout a product's life cycle. The requirement will \ninitially apply to the 25 product groups where official tools are available to assess the total cost of \nownership. In addition, the governme nt is strengthening its efforts to develop TCO tools for even more \nprocurement areas and to make existing tools even more user -friendly. \nThe two initiatives are implemented through a Statutory Order on environmental and energy \nconsiderations in public pro curement, which is currently expected to enter into force ultimo 202 4.

This meant that private wa ste collectors and waste treatment operators should adapt to different \nlocal solutions, which created a fragmented market. This resulted in lack of economies of scale when waste \nwas treated, limited competition, sub -optimal solutions in waste collection an d in the communication with \ncitizens. \nSince July 2021 , pictograms, sorting criteria and collection schemes for household waste have been \nstreamlined nationally . The Statutory Order of Waste includes mandatory waste pictograms (for collection \nbins) and mandatory sorting criteria for ten fractions of household waste. Similar waste from public and \nprivate companies are obliged to use the same pictograms and sorting criteria. Door – to door collections \nhas become mandatory for 10 waste fractions (food, paper, cardboard, glass, metal, plastics, food - and \ndrinking cartons, textile, hazardous waste and residual waste). If door – to - door collection is not possible, \ncol lection points must be placed within ‘a short walking distance’. \nCo -mingling is only allowed in the following combinations: \n\n\npaper/cardboard \n\n\nmetal/glass \n\n\nmetal/plastics \n\n\nmetal/plastics/food - and drinking cartons \n\n\nplastics/food - and drinking cartons \n\n\nGreen national accounts (modelling of environmental and economic linkages (11 )\nThe Danish government has developed GreenReform, a new e nvironmental and climate -economic CGE -\nmodel (computable general equilibrium model) for the Danish economy. The modelling framew ork will \nsupplement existing macro -economic models with the aim of an integrated and consistent assessment of \nthe environmental and climate effects of economic policies, as well as the socioeconomic effects of \nenvironmental, energy and climate policies. Th e development of GreenREFORM is focused on developing \nsub -models, which among other things describe the energy, transportation, agriculture and waste \nmanagement sectors. \nOn top of these sub -models, a main model is being developed in the form of a CGE -model, which describes \nthe total economic activity in Denmark , and combines the results of the sub -models. GreenREFORM is \nbeing designed as a fully integrated model system , where all of the sub -models and the main model \ninteract and are solved simultan eously. Thereby, GreenREFORM shows the impact on e.g. waste \ngeneration and recycling, when implementing a specific economic policy or a policy in e.g. the \ntransportation sector. The model is depending on Green national accounts (following the UN standard) \nand is anchored in the Ministry of Finance – in cooperation with the relevant ministries (such as \nenvironment, food, climate and transport).    \n\n10 https://mst.dk/affald -jord/affald/affaldsfraktioner/de -ti -affaldsfraktioner/ (in Danish)\n11 https://dreamgroup.dk/economic -models/greenreform\nReport in English:\nhttps://dreamgroup.dk/Media/638493769228252341/Development_of_the_GreenREFORM_model.pdf\n\nETC -CE Report 2024/Denmark 14 \nThere is an ongoing EU -financed project with the Ministry of Finance in Austria, Finland and Italy, as well \nas nat ional agencies in Belgium and Poland, in order to develop environmental -economic CGE -models \ninspired by GreenReform 12 .\nThis innovative approach to modelling is being followed closely internationally (13 ).\nDecreasing threshold limit values for climate footprint from buildings (14 )\nWith the National Strategy for Sustainable Construction 15 , the Government introduces in the Building Code \na decreasing mandatory threshold limit value for climate footprint for new buildings .

One way to do so is to \nrecycle or reuse building materials, thereby maximising their lifespan and reusability. \nA prime example of this is The Circle House, which is expected to be completed north of the Danish city of \nAarhus in 2023. The Circ le house project, led by 3XN Architects, is devised to be a blueprint for circular \nconstruction in Denmark , with 90% of its building material able to be demounted and reused or resold \nwithout loss of value. \nAdditionally, besides using concrete and cement a s the main building material, the building project is set \nto minimize its CO2 footprint by using alternative materials, such as: \n• Cork and old newspapers, that are used for the façade of the buildings \n• Eelgrass and granules, which will provide insulation in the buildings \n• Used car tyres for the flooring’s underlay \nOnce completed, the Circular House will be the world’s first social housing project constructed according \nto circular principles. The hope is that the Circle House will create valuable learnings on h ow circular \nbuildings function in daily life, as well as provide a way of reducing carbon footprint within the construction \nsector. It is estimated that a circular approach to buildings will reduce CO2 emissions from materials used \nin the built environment by 38% by 2050. Furthermore, it is estimated that Denmark has the economic \npotential in implementing a circular economy in its building industry amounting to approximately € 7.75 \nbillion per annum up to 2035. \nRecycling of Wind Turbines (21 )\nThe turbines of the wind industry’s early days are reaching their end of life. Some are life extended while \nothers will be decommissioned during the next years. To combat this problem, the DecomBlades \ninnovation project has commit ted to try to find a sustainab le way to dispose the wind turbines with \nrespect to the environment, health and safety of workers. Today, significant progress has been made as \nthe project has succeeded in extracting and processing high -quality glass fibres , the principal wind blade \ncompo nent, from retired 37 -meter tall wind turbines. \nThe DecomBlades project is funded by Innovation Fund Denmark with MAKEEN Energy having developed \nthe large -scale pyrolysis test plant. Following the successful quality approval of glass fibres obtained from \ndecommissioned wind turbine blades, the material was subjected to remelting at 3B’s facility in Norway   \n\n20 https://stateofgreen.com/en/solutions/denmarks -first -circular -social -housing -project/\n21 https://stateofgreen.com/en/news/new -project -achieves -breakthrough -in -recycling -wind -turbine -blades/\n\nETC -CE Report 2024/Denmark 16 \nthis past September. In a collaborative effort alongside DTU Wind and Energy Systems, both 3B and DTU \nwill now examine and verify the properties of the generated glass fibres with remelted content. \nTh e way forward\nIdentifying and a ddressing barriers and challenges \nAccording to European Commission /JRC Denmark’s consumption footprint is not within planetary \nboundaries (22 ), a nd Denmark’s material footprint is much higher than the European average. This is mainly \nexplained by consumption of food, cars and buildings. \nThese challenges in high consumption of e.g. food, cars and buildings are best overcome by ambitious \npolicies a t a European level such as: \nImplementing the following: \n• Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR) ( proposed in March 2022 , e ntry into force \nJuly 2024 )\n• Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive ( proposed in November 2022 )\n• the Construction Product s Regulation ( proposed in March 2022) \nCompleting negotiations on: \n• The End -of -life Vehicles Directive ( Proposed in July 2023 )\n• Binding food waste reduction targets in the revised Waste Framework Directive ( proposed in July \n2023) \n• Green Claims Directive (Proposed in March 2023) \nNew EU legislation \n• Binding targets for consumption and material footprint (follow up on EAP8, article 3(s)) \n• Expanding waste hierarchy with focus on high quality recycling and differentiated waste \nprevention. \n• Binding rec ycling targets for construction and demolition waste in the revised Waste Framework \nDirective \nFuture policy plans \nDenmark’s national reform programme ( 23 ) from 2023 dedicates one of its chapters to “ Climate, \nEnvironment and Circular Economy ”.
