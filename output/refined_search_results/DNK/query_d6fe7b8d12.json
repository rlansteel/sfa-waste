In 2022, Denmark generated 803 kg of waste per person annually.\n2\nRecycling and energy recovery:\nWhile Denmark has traditionally relied on incineration for non-recyclable waste, the government is now increasing efforts to shift towards material recycling. The Amager Bakke (CopenHill) facility in Copenhagen is an example of this approach. It serves as both a waste-to-energy plant and a public recreational space. National policies now promote mandatory waste sorting and increased investment in recycling infrastructure to meet EU-aligned targets\n3\nCircular economy initiatives\nDenmark's strategic waste plans aim to increase the recycling rate of household waste to 55% by 2025, 60% by 2030, and 65% by 2035. A total of 129 initiatives across various sectors, including construction, plastics, food, and electronics, form the foundation of the national circular economy agenda, supporting both climate goals and economic resilience.\n4\nHazardous waste oversight\nA 2024 landslide involving contaminated industrial soil near Randers exposed vulnerabilities in Denmark’s hazardous waste oversight. The event revealed weaknesses in tracking, storage safety, and legal enforcement, underscoring the need for more robust controls and corporate accountability in managing industrial waste.\n5\nLocal-level implementation gaps\nWhile Denmark’s national strategies are well-developed, implementation at the municipal level remains inconsistent. Local governments vary in their capacity to enforce new sorting obligations, expand recycling infrastructure, and effectively engage residents. This uneven rollout may hinder progress toward nationwide circular economy targets, particularly in rural or under-resourced areas.\n\nOpportunities to improve waste management in Denmark\n1\nUpgrading recycling infrastructure\nDenmark’s circular economy targets depend on diverting more waste away from incineration and into material recovery. To achieve this, the government is prioritizing investment in advanced sorting technologies, expanded collection systems, and regional recycling hubs, particularly for plastics, textiles, and electronics. These infrastructure upgrades can improve material quality and recovery rates while reducing climate impacts.\n2\nPromoting waste prevention\nReducing waste at the source is a core goal of Denmark’s National Waste Prevention Plan, which calls for better product design, reduced food waste, and more circular business models. Public education, eco-labeling, and economic incentives—such as taxes on disposable packaging—can play a larger role in shifting consumer and producer behavior toward waste minimization.\n3\nStrengthening regulatory frameworks\nRecent hazardous waste incidents have shown the need for more robust enforcement of existing regulations. Strengthening digital traceability systems, increasing inspection capacity, and introducing stricter penalties for violations can ensure that corporate actors are held accountable and that risks are better mitigated at local and national levels.\n4\nFostering innovation\nDenmark’s action plan outlines opportunities for public-private partnerships and innovation grants targeting waste valorization, product reuse, and bio-based alternatives. Supporting research and pilot projects in these areas, especially through the green transition funds, can accelerate the adoption of scalable, circular technologies in both industry and municipalities.\nHow Azortum can help Denmark improve Waste Management\nAzortum offers solutions to help Denmark address its current waste management challenges and meet future circular economy goals:\n\nSorting and recovery technologies: Advanced sorting systems are designed to improve recycling performance, especially for plastics, textiles, and electronic waste. Our solutions support Denmark's goal of shifting waste from incineration to material recovery.\nRetrofitting facilities: Upgrading and modernizing existing recycling plants to increase throughput and material recovery rates, while also ensuring compliance with Denmark's new waste separation and processing standards.\nPlastic recycling expertise: Tailored systems for handling complex plastic waste, especially packaging and mixed fractions. These solutions respond directly to Denmark's national targets for reducing plastic incineration and increasing recycling under the 2020 waste sector reform.\n\nAzortum's modular and scalable technologies are tailored to local needs and integrate seamlessly with Denmark's policy-driven transition toward a more circular, resource-efficient economy.\nFinal thoughts\nDenmark's waste management system is among the most developed in Europe, underpinned by national strategies that promote recycling, waste prevention, and the circular use of resources. However, significant challenges remain. While improving plastic recycling and hazardous waste oversight are some of the gaps that need to be addressed in local implementation, reducing reliance on incineration is the biggest challenge Denmark faces.\nTo meet its national and EU-aligned targets, Denmark must continue to invest in infrastructure, foster innovation, and strengthen policy enforcement. With tailored technologies and expertise in sorting, recovery, and facility modernization, Azortum is well-positioned to support Denmark's transition toward a more circular and sustainable waste future.\nCited sources\n\nDanish Ministry of Environment (MIM.dk).

As the number of people move towards the city center, the amount of rubbish generated on residential as well as commercial levels increases. Waste peaks in urban areas from household and construction debris that need to be properly processed and collected extremes of waste handling in cities.\n\nFor instance, as noted by the World Bank report, urban population per year in Denmark (2022) stands at having increased by 0.97% from last year to 5.22 million. The increased urban waste stream demands that advanced infrastructure like centralized waste separation facilities and urban recycling programs get designed for better sustainability.\n\nAlso, the increasing focus on recycling in Denmark, supported by ambitious sustainability objectives, established the country as a leader in waste management. Denmark’s robust recycling mandates and waste separation practices at both residential and industrial levels aim to minimize landfill dependency while maximizing resource recovery.\n\nAccording to the report published by European Environment Agency, the rate of municipal waste collected for recycling is forecasted to achieve 55 % target for 2025. To achieve these objectives, substantial investments are directed toward advanced recycling technologies and infrastructure, such as automated waste sorting systems and specialized facilities for processing plastics, metals, and organic waste. These initiatives align with Denmark's overarching commitment to advancing a circular economy and supporting environmental sustainability.\n\nHowever, Denmark waste management market operates within a framework of stringent environmental regulations set forth by both national and European Union authorities. Key regulatory sources include Denmark’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Danish Waste Management Act, and EU directives such as the Waste Framework Directive and the Circular Economy Action Plan. Adhering to these regulations, which relate to waste segregation, recycling targets, and landfill reduction, can be both complicated and resource-heavy.\n\nOn the contrary, the adoption of waste to energy technologies such as incineration and gasification presents a significant growth opportunity for the waste management market as these technologies convert waste materials into usable energy that reduces landfill dependency and contribute to sustainable energy generation.\n\nBy transforming waste into a valuable resource, waste to energy solutions promote environmental sustainability and drive the Denmark waste management market expansion.

With the EU Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP 2020) \"the Commission [..] encourages Member States to adopt or update their national circular economy strategies, plans and measures in the light of its ambition\". These country profiles originate in the work leading to the EEA More from less report (2016) 1, that presented an overview of approaches to material resource efficiency and to circular economy in thirty-two European countries. The More from Less report was followed by the 2019 EEA Report ‘Resource efficiency and the circular economy in Europe 2019 – even more from less: An overview of the policies, approaches and targets of 32 European countries’2. It presented an updated and extended assessment of approaches and identified trends, similarities and new directions taken by countries in the connected policy areas of resource efficiency and the circular economy. These reports, comprising a compilation of extensive survey responses from countries, were accompanied by 32 country profiles. In the second quarter of 2022 a new survey with questions and guidelines was launched. Based on information reported by the Eionet network, in particular, the Eionet Group on Circular Economy and Resource Use, and after review and editing by the European Topic Centre on Circular economy and resource use (ETC CE), the 30 2022 CE country profiles3 were published alongside the EEA report ‘Circular Economy policy innovation and good practice in Member States’4 (2022). These 2024 CE country profiles are an update of the 2022 ones and based on the responses of 29 countries to the survey questions and guidelines that were launched in March 2024. The information in the countries’ responses was again reviewed and edited by the European Topic Centre on Circular economy and resource use. A selection of Eurostat data was made to further complement these country profiles. The main objectives of these assessments and its updates are to: • stimulate exchange of information and share good practice examples among country experts; • support policymakers in Eionet countries, the European institutions and international organisations by providing an updated catalogue of circular economy actions being undertaken in European countries. This circular economy country profile is based on information reported by the Eionet network and, in particular, the Eionet Group members on Resource Efficiency and Circular Economy in the second quarter of 2024. Proposals for the further development or amendment of policies represent the view of the reporting country. For Denmark, all input was provided by the Danish Ministry of Environment. The information was reviewed and edited by the European Topic Centre on Circular economy and resource use. A selection of Eurostat data was made to further complement this country profile. 1 More from less — material resource efficiency in Europe — European Environment Agency (europa.eu) 2 Resource efficiency and the circular economy in Europe 2019 — European Environment Agency (europa.eu) 3 Country profiles on Circular Economy in Europe — Eionet Portal (europa.eu) 4 draft-report-for-dg-env_final.pdf (europa.eu) ETC-CE Report 2024/Denmark 3 The information is current as of September 2024, when members of Eionet verified the content of this profile.

The Action Plan describes the Danish targets, indicators, policies and initiatives along the entire circular value chain, from design through consumption to waste from which natural resources are recycled into new products and materials. In addition to several initiatives along the value chain in general, the Action Plan focusses on three areas with significant environmental and climate impact: biomass, construction and plastics. The Action plan for Circular Economy contains 129 national initiatives – many of which are still under implementation. At the time of data collection, 79 initiatives had been completed, 20 were on schedule, 29 were delayed, and 1 had been cancelled. A new initiative that has been implemented is the mandatory door-to-door collection of household textile waste in all Danish municipalities from 1July 2023. Denmark has chosen to introduce this ahead of the EU-requirement for 2025, and with a door-to-door collection or similar collection systems close to the households in order to maximize the impact on recycling. In Denmark, many of the initiatives regarding circular economy and waste prevention are housed in other ministries than the Ministry of Environment. The Danish Government's Action Plan for Circular Economy has initiatives run by 7 different ministries. This contributes to a broad collaboration of actors and sectors. There is still room for improvement in terms of adapting the institutional set-up to mainstream circularity further across sectors and actors. A noteworthy successful approach includes the new environmental and climate-economic-CGE-model “Green Reform” that has been developed by the Danish Government5. The model will be used to assess the environmental impact of economic activity as well as the economic effects of environmental, energy and climate policies. Underpinning the impact assessments in GreenReform is an LCA-based model, which will enable the projections on the circular economy under different policy and technology scenarios. The model is dependent on Green National Accounts (following the UN standard) and is anchored in the Ministry of Finance – in cooperation with the relevant ministries (such as Environment, Food, Climate and Transport). Circular Cities The Region of Central Denmark has participated in the Circular Cities And Regions Initiative (CCRI). In addition, many Danish municipalities are ambitious when it comes to circular economy. For example, the municipality of Copenhagen has set circular economy targets in their “Resource and Waste Plan” for 2024(6). 5 https://fm.dk/nyheder/nyhedsarkiv/2020/oktober/danmark-i-spidsen-for-internationalt-samarbejde-om-groenne-regnemodeller/ (in Danish) 6 https://www.kk.dk/politik/politikker-og-indsatser/klima-og-miljoe/cirkulaer-koebenhavn-ressource-og-affaldsplan (in Danish) The draft-version of the 2030-plan for Copenhagen is available at https://www.kk.dk/sites/default/files/agenda/4c2ace22-b3ad-4eae-8a00-7fea405ffd51/c9f94d92-06ad-4320-8c91-e6022246f487-bilag-2_0.pdf (in Danish) ETC-CE Report 2024/Denmark 9 Circular economy policy elements included in other policies Circular economy policy element Included in policy Streamlined pictogrammes, sorting criteria and collection schemes for household waste, including: - Mandatory waste pictograms for collection bins. - Mandatory sorting criteria for ten fractions of household waste. - Public and private companies are also obliged to use the same pictograms and sorting criteria for their municipal waste. - Door-to-door collections have become mandatory for ten waste fractions – food, paper, cardboard, glass, metal, plastics, food and drink cartons, textiles, hazardous waste and residual waste. Climate Plan for a Green Waste Sector and Circular Economy (in Danish) - 15 initiatives to support the reduction of food waste - The initiatives are divided in the following 4 tracks: involvement of actors and simplification of rules across the food value chain; more knowledge on effective means of action; communication and access to tools; international engagement Denmark’s national food waste strategy 2024-2027 (in Danish) Summary of strategy and launch (in Danish) New requirements (01/07/24 + 1 year transition period) on selective demolition when demolishing buildings with a size of 250 m2 or more. The requirements include planning, a mapping of resources, and specific competencies. Climate Plan for a Green Waste Sector and Circular Economy (in Danish) - Update the Building Regulations with elements from the voluntary sustainability standard - Introduce increasing limit values for climate footprint from buildings - Develop the existing Danish LCA- and LCC-tools for buildings into design-tools The National Strategy for Sustainable Construction (in Danish) - Mandatory use of ecolabels in state procurement for specific product groups. - Mandatory use of total cost of ownership in state procurement for specific product groups. National Strategy for green public procurement A new environmental and climate-economic model, Green Reform has been developed. The model will be used to assess the environmental impact of economic activity as well as the economic effects of environmental and climate policies. Underpinning the impact assessments in GreenReform is an LCA based model, which will enable the projections on the circular economy under different policy and technology scenarios. Green national accounts (modelling of environment-economy linkages) ETC-CE Report 2024/Denmark 10 Monitoring and targets Assessment of circular economy performance The European Commission has set up a monitoring framework to keep track of progress towards a circular economy. This framework provides a holistic view as it: • measures direct and indirect benefits of 'becoming circular' and • values the contribution of a circular economy in living well within the limits of the planet • addresses energy and material supply risks. It consists of 5 thematic sections with a total of 11 statistical indicators, some of which have additional sub-indicators. In some cases policy targets exist which should be achieved in the future, and the indicators monitor progress towards these targets. The current monitoring framework is a revision of the original framework which was set up in 2018. This section elaborates on the assessment of Denmark its progress in terms of observed trends over the last 5 years and what country characteristics or policy actions may explain differences between the country its performance and the average EU performance. Production and consumption: • Material footprint has increased at a higher rate in 2021 compared to a more steady increase in the previous years. It continues to be above the EU average. • Waste generation has remained relatively steady and decreased from 2018-20227. Waste management: • The recycling rate of municipal waste has been increasing steadily, however between 2019-2022 there have been some fluctuations. It is slightly higher than the EU average. Secondary raw materials: • The circular material use rate is slightly decreasing, and below the EU average. Competitiveness and innovation: • Data for indicators related to private investments, persons employed and gross value added show a relatively steady state in recent years. Global sustainability and resilience: • The consumption footprint has remained relatively stable between 2018-2021, but increased relatively more in 2021. It is higher than the EU average. • GHG emissions from production activities have been steadily decreasing, with a small spike in 2020. It lies above the EU average. • The material import dependency has remained stable, but is also higher than the EU average. What may explain differences between Denmark’s performance and average EU performance: • High recycling rates (relative to the EU average) can be linked to increasing curbside collection of more fractions of household waste by municipalities. • The high material and consumption footprint may be linked to (amongst other factors) high income levels and associated high consumption levels. This may also link to the relatively high material import dependency in Denmark.

The results of the monitoring will be published once every year on the Ministry of Environment’s website. Circular economy targets Denmark works to ensure compliance with quantitative targets set by the EU. As such, there are no national quantitative targets. Denmark is still awaiting data that can showcase the effects of the newly harmonised waste management system on recycling, which has been gradually implemented from 2021 to 2023. Furthermore, Denmark’s status on reaching the EU-defined circular economy targets is currently being calculated using the new EU recycling rate methodology where technical adjustments are still being made. Innovative approaches and good practices Examples of public policy initiatives (national, regional or local) ➔ Good practice example: Green/Circular/Sustainable public procurement Mandatory use of ecolabels and total cost of ownership in public procurement (9) In 2022 it became mandatory to choose an eco-labelled product or a product that meets similar requirements when procuring for the state for product groups where the government assesses that there is adequate competition and no significant price difference. Initially, it will be mandatory for the following products to be eco-labelled or meet similar requirements: paper and printed matter, cleaning and cleaning agents, soap and some hygiene products, standard batteries and indoor painting. The list of product groups with requirements for eco-labelled procurement will be updated once a year and expanded on an ongoing basis. Furthermore, the government is making it mandatory to use total cost of ownership (TCO) as an economic price parameter in connection with state procurement where possible and appropriate. In this way, the focus will shift from the acquisition price to costs throughout a product's life cycle. The requirement will initially apply to the 25 product groups where official tools are available to assess the total cost of ownership. In addition, the government is strengthening its efforts to develop TCO tools for even more procurement areas and to make existing tools even more user-friendly. The two initiatives are implemented through a Statutory Order on environmental and energy considerations in public procurement, which is currently expected to enter into force ultimo 2024.

This meant that private waste collectors and waste treatment operators should adapt to different local solutions, which created a fragmented market. This resulted in lack of economies of scale when waste was treated, limited competition, sub-optimal solutions in waste collection and in the communication with citizens. Since July 2021, pictograms, sorting criteria and collection schemes for household waste have been streamlined nationally. The Statutory Order of Waste includes mandatory waste pictograms (for collection bins) and mandatory sorting criteria for ten fractions of household waste. Similar waste from public and private companies are obliged to use the same pictograms and sorting criteria. Door – to door collections has become mandatory for 10 waste fractions (food, paper, cardboard, glass, metal, plastics, food- and drinking cartons, textile, hazardous waste and residual waste). If door – to - door collection is not possible, collection points must be placed within ‘a short walking distance’. Co-mingling is only allowed in the following combinations: - paper/cardboard - metal/glass - metal/plastics - metal/plastics/food- and drinking cartons - plastics/food- and drinking cartons Green national accounts (modelling of environmental and economic linkages (11) The Danish government has developed GreenReform, a new environmental and climate-economic CGE-model (computable general equilibrium model) for the Danish economy. The modelling framework will supplement existing macro-economic models with the aim of an integrated and consistent assessment of the environmental and climate effects of economic policies, as well as the socioeconomic effects of environmental, energy and climate policies. The development of GreenREFORM is focused on developing sub-models, which among other things describe the energy, transportation, agriculture and waste management sectors. On top of these sub-models, a main model is being developed in the form of a CGE-model, which describes the total economic activity in Denmark, and combines the results of the sub-models. GreenREFORM is being designed as a fully integrated model system, where all of the sub-models and the main model interact and are solved simultaneously. Thereby, GreenREFORM shows the impact on e.g. waste generation and recycling, when implementing a specific economic policy or a policy in e.g. the transportation sector. The model is depending on Green national accounts (following the UN standard) and is anchored in the Ministry of Finance – in cooperation with the relevant ministries (such as environment, food, climate and transport). 10 https://mst.dk/affald-jord/affald/affaldsfraktioner/de-ti-affaldsfraktioner/ (in Danish) 11 https://dreamgroup.dk/economic-models/greenreform Report in English: https://dreamgroup.dk/Media/638493769228252341/Development_of_the_GreenREFORM_model.pdf ETC-CE Report 2024/Denmark 14 There is an ongoing EU-financed project with the Ministry of Finance in Austria, Finland and Italy, as well as national agencies in Belgium and Poland, in order to develop environmental-economic CGE-models inspired by GreenReform12. This innovative approach to modelling is being followed closely internationally (13). Decreasing threshold limit values for climate footprint from buildings (14) With the National Strategy for Sustainable Construction15, the Government introduces in the Building Code a decreasing mandatory threshold limit value for climate footprint for new buildings. A mandatory threshold limit is introduced for all new buildings from 2025 (16). From here, the limit value will be introduced gradually according to the indicative proposal below: - - From mid-2025: Maximum 7.1kg CO2e/m2/year (all new buildings) - From mid-2027: Maximum 6.4kg CO2e/m2/year (all new buildings) - From mid-2029: Maximum 5.8kg CO2e/m2/year (all new buildings) Examples of private policy initiatives (sectoral) The State of Green describes how circular economy practices are implemented across various sectors in Denmark (17). This includes descriptions of specific circular economy solutions(18), of which 3 will be highlighted in this section. ➔ Good practice example: New business models Industrial Symbiosis: a model for Growth in Circular Economy (19) Industrial symbiosis is a method for using scarce materials effectively and sustainably, representing a way for companies to lower environmental impact and production expenses. Through the “Sustainable Synergies” project facilitated by Port of Aalborg, Aalborg University and energy cluster House of Energy, 25 Danish companies have exchanged residual and surplus products such as water, energy, or materials. The project was designed to improve the competitiveness of SMEs in Aalborg East by developing green business models that would improve energy efficiency and resource efficiency through a facilitated industrial symbiosis. The companies involved in the symbiosis have experienced a range of benefits. For example, an exchange of surplus resources has resulted in direct benefits, such as reduced waste 12 https://commission.europa.eu/document/download/685c0d7a-353f-4e50-ac02-4328d58ebaa7_en?filename=C_2024_1817_1_EN_annexe_acte_autonome_nlw_part1_v2.pdf page 35-36 13 https://fm.dk/nyheder/nyhedsarkiv/2020/oktober/danmark-i-spidsen-for-internationalt-samarbejde-om-groenne-regnemodeller (in Danish) 14 https://im.dk/Media/637602217765946554/National_Strategy_for_Sustainable_Construktion.pdf 15https://www.sbst.dk/Media/638248402790994130/National%20strategi%20for%20b%C3%A6redygtigt%20bygge ri.pdf (In Danish) 16 https://www.sm.dk/Media/638525928477219508/Till%c3%a6gsaftale_om_stramning_af_CO2e-krav_til_bygninger.pdf (In Danish) 17 https://stateofgreen.com/en/focus-areas/circular-economy/ 18 https://stateofgreen.com/en/news/10-examples-of-circular-economy-solutions/ 19 Industrial Symbiosis: a model for growth in the circular economy (stateofgreen.com) ETC-CE Report 2024/Denmark 15 management and materials procurement costs. Additionally, extra income was generated through product innovation and new products, as well as creating new markets and/or customer groups. Additionally, several positive environmental results have been achieved: • Energy consumption was reduced by 11.000 gigajoules • Materials consumption was reduced by approximately 2.600 tonnes of FE-equivalents • Each company saved 264 MWh of energy – corresponding to the energy consumption of eight households • The collaboration contributed to a reduction of annual CO2emissions by 10,000 tonnes • Each symbiosis created reduced CO2 emissions by 800 tonnes – corresponding to CO2 emissions of 100 Danish residents ➔ Good practice example for other sector/value chain Denmark’s first circular social housing project (20) With the building industry responsible for a sizeable amount of global CO2 emissions (approximately 39% in total), the need for a circular approach to construction and design is required. One way to do so is to recycle or reuse building materials, thereby maximising their lifespan and reusability. A prime example of this is The Circle House, which is expected to be completed north of the Danish city of Aarhus in 2023. The Circle house project, led by 3XN Architects, is devised to be a blueprint for circular construction in Denmark, with 90% of its building material able to be demounted and reused or resold without loss of value. Additionally, besides using concrete and cement as the main building material, the building project is set to minimize its CO2 footprint by using alternative materials, such as: • Cork and old newspapers, that are used for the façade of the buildings • Eelgrass and granules, which will provide insulation in the buildings • Used car tyres for the flooring’s underlay Once completed, the Circular House will be the world’s first social housing project constructed according to circular principles. The hope is that the Circle House will create valuable learnings on how circular buildings function in daily life, as well as provide a way of reducing carbon footprint within the construction sector. It is estimated that a circular approach to buildings will reduce CO2 emissions from materials used in the built environment by 38% by 2050. Furthermore, it is estimated that Denmark has the economic potential in implementing a circular economy in its building industry amounting to approximately € 7.75 billion per annum up to 2035. Recycling of Wind Turbines (21) The turbines of the wind industry’s early days are reaching their end of life. Some are life extended while others will be decommissioned during the next years. To combat this problem, the DecomBlades innovation project has committed to try to find a sustainable way to dispose the wind turbines with respect to the environment, health and safety of workers. Today, significant progress has been made as the project has succeeded in extracting and processing high-quality glass fibres, the principal wind blade component, from retired 37-meter tall wind turbines. The DecomBlades project is funded by Innovation Fund Denmark with MAKEEN Energy having developed the large-scale pyrolysis test plant. Following the successful quality approval of glass fibres obtained from decommissioned wind turbine blades, the material was subjected to remelting at 3B’s facility in Norway 20 https://stateofgreen.com/en/solutions/denmarks-first-circular-social-housing-project/ 21 https://stateofgreen.com/en/news/new-project-achieves-breakthrough-in-recycling-wind-turbine-blades/ ETC-CE Report 2024/Denmark 16 this past September. In a collaborative effort alongside DTU Wind and Energy Systems, both 3B and DTU will now examine and verify the properties of the generated glass fibres with remelted content. The way forward Identifying and addressing barriers and challenges According to European Commission/JRC Denmark’s consumption footprint is not within planetary boundaries (22), and Denmark’s material footprint is much higher than the European average. This is mainly explained by consumption of food, cars and buildings. These challenges in high consumption of e.g. food, cars and buildings are best overcome by ambitious policies at a European level such as: Implementing the following: • Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR) (proposed in March 2022, entry into force July 2024) • Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive (proposed in November 2022) • the Construction Products Regulation (proposed in March 2022) Completing negotiations on: • The End-of-life Vehicles Directive (Proposed in July 2023) • Binding food waste reduction targets in the revised Waste Framework Directive (proposed in July 2023) • Green Claims Directive (Proposed in March 2023) New EU legislation • Binding targets for consumption and material footprint (follow up on EAP8, article 3(s)) • Expanding waste hierarchy with focus on high quality recycling and differentiated waste prevention. • Binding recycling targets for construction and demolition waste in the revised Waste Framework Directive Future policy plans Denmark’s national reform programme( 23 ) from 2023 dedicates one of its chapters to “Climate, Environment and Circular Economy”. The publication refers to already existing circular economy initiatives in Denmark, such as: • A plastic action plan to reduce the quantity of plastic in nature (underway) • An extended producer responsibility for packaging and single-use plastic products (underway) • Requirements for wastewater cleansing so that the spread of environmentally damaging materials – including PFOS/PFAS – is minimized, and make it easier for water supply companies to establish biogas, pyrolysis and lime cleaning as well as other green solutions (underway) • A raw material plan that supports sustainable mining of sand and aggregate as well as more reutilization of building materials (underway) 22 https://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ConsumptionFootprintPlatform.html 23 Denmark’s National Reform Programme 2023 – MAJ 2023 (fm.dk) ETC-CE Report 2024/Denmark 17 Annex Targets and indicators 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 EU-mål Total CO2e emissions from waste sector (Mio. tons) 2,5 2,5 2,4 2,4 2,4 2,4 - Waste reduction and better use of natural resources Volume of municipal waste and similar waste from other sources per capita (kilo) 798 779 774 807 813 754 - Material footprint (RMC per capita) (tons) 23,3 22,9 23,2 24,2 25,7 26,7 - Resource productivity (BNP/RMC) (2010 DKR. per kilo) 14,91 15,55 15,56 15,05 13,80 14,13 - Number of Swan certified products and services >11.000 >12.500 >14.500 >16.500 >18.500 >21.000 Turnover of Swan certified products and services (billion DKR) 8,3 8,3 8,7 9,1 9,6 13,9 - Share of recycling (and other final use of resources) in domestic resource consumption (DMC) 8,0% 7,9% 8,0% 7,6% 7,6% 8,0% - Climate footprint of public procurement (Mio. ton CO2e) - - - 14,3 15,1 16,0 All public procurement must be environmentally certified by 2030 - More and better recycling Recycling of municipal waste - - - - - 46% >55% i 2025 >60% i 2030 >65% i 2035 Landfilling of municipal waste 1% 1% 1% 1% 1% 1% <10% i 2035 Recycling of packaging waste - - - 62% 63% 65% >65% i 2025 >70% i 2030 Recycling of glass packaging waste - - - 82% 84% 84% >70% i 2025 >75% i 2030 Recycling of paper and cardboard packaging waste - - - 69% 69% 71% >75% i 2025 >85% i 2030 Recycling of iron and metal packaging waste - - - 61% 65% 66% >70% i 2025 >80% i 2030 Recycling of aluminium packaging waste - - 70% - 70% 77% >50% i 2025 >60% i 2030 Recycling of wood packaging waste - - 42% 88% 88% 88% >25% i 2025 >30% i 2030 Recycling or preparation for reuse of end of life vehicles 89% 92% 90% 95% 95% 83% >85% Collection for recycling or preparation for reuse of end of life vehicles 97% 100% 98% 103% 103% 94% >95% Separate collection of electronic waste (WEEE) 58% 59% 57% 63% 53% 50% >65% Portable batteries (DPA) - - 49% 55% 59% 56% >45% Reduce amount of marine waste significantly - More value from renewable resources Share of biomass in domestic material consumption (DMC) 31% 32% 29% 31% 31% 30% - Volume of recycled biowaste (kilo per capita) 198 196 194 206 209 208 - Recycling of phosphorus from waste water and sludge 73% 73% 76% 67% 72% 74% - Reduce volume of food waste in all parts of the food value chain Volume of food waste from primary production (1000 tons) - - 59 - 66 56 - Volume of food waste from food processing industry (1000 tons) - - 529 - 597 608 - Volume of food waste from distribution and sales (1000 tons) - - - 99 100 100 - Volume of food waste from restaurants (1000 tons) - - 71 - 63 72 - Volume of food waste from households (1000 tons) - 456 - - 461 507 - Reduce environmental impact of construction and demolition Volume of extracted mineral resources from land and sea including reused materials (1000 m3) 28.886 30.560 31.051 29.847 33.216 33.472 - Share of construction with Swan certificate or DGNB, LEED or BREEAM - 7% 16% 29% 32% 43% - Reuse of preparation for reuse of construction waste - - 38% 34% 33% 36% - Reuse, preparation for reuse or other final use of construction waste 85% 85% 89% 87% 87% 86% >70% Reduce consumption and improve reuse and recycling of plastic Volume of marketed plastic packaging (1000 tons) 215 201 248 217 234 227 - Volume of certain single use plastic products (tons) - - 6.272 - - - - Recycling of plastic packaging 14% 20% 23% 23% >50% i 2025 >55% i 2030 Share of recycled plastic in new plastic bottles - - - 28% 33% 52% >25% i 2025 >30% i 2030 Separate collection of plastic bottles - - - 94% 96% 95% >70% i 2025 >90% i 2029 European Topic Centre on Circular economy and resource use https://www.eionet.europa.eu/etcs/etc-ce The European Topic Centre on Circular economy and resource use (ETC-CE) is a consortium of European institutes under contract of the European Environment Agency."

The action plan was drafted in 2020 and \nsent for consultation in December 2020. The final plan was \npublished Ju ne 2021. \nThe Action Plan for Circular Economy describes the Danish \ntargets, indicators, policies and initiatives in the entire circular \nvalue chain, which ranges from design and consumption to \nwaste management, from which natural resources are \nrecycled into new products and materials. \n\nForeseen budget for \n\nimplementation of the project \nNo specific budget for the implementation of the programme is \nincluded in the programme. \nWASTE GENERATION The following figures illustrate the progress towards waste prevention and decoupling of waste \ngeneration from economic growth in Denmark :\nMSW  \n\n•\n\nThe generation of municipal waste per capita (see Figure 1) increased from 740 kg per capita \nin 2006 and reach ed its maximum in 201 1 with 862 kg per capita. The trend stagnated after \n2011 and 20 12 -2019 waste generation has remained on the same level 810 -840 kg/capita and \nyear , and in 2020 this dropped somewhat to 814 kg. Denmark’s waste generation is thereby \none of the highest in Europe , compared to the 2020 per capita European average of 517 kg 1. \n\n•\n\nThe first WPP of Denmark came into force in 2013 and, although MSW generation is \ninfluenced by many factors ( e.g. household expenditure), the prevention measures in that \nWPP might partially explain the stable trend in waste generation. To note is that household \nexpenditure increased steadily during the same period 2, thus some decoupling effect may have \noccurred. \nFigure 1: Municipal waste generation in Denmark (kg per capita) , 2006 -20 20 (data unavailable in \n2010) \nSource: Eurostat [ENV_WASMUN] \nTotal waste  \n\n•\n\nDenmark ´s waste generation (excluding major mineral wastes) has fluctuated from 2010 to \n2020 but decreased overall by 4% (see Figure 2). During the same period , Denmark’s GDP \ngrew steadily . \n\n•\n\nAlthough a longer time series is needed to solidify a decoupling conclusion, Denmark seems \nto be on track to decouple total w aste (excluding major mineral wastes) generation from \neconomic growth since 201 0. \n\n•\n\nThere may be slight decoupling between total waste (excluding major mineral wastes) \ngeneration and population growth, which grew slowly during the same period 2010 -2020 .                      \n\n1Based on data collected from Eurostat in September 2022.\n2https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.CON.PRVT.PP.KD?end=2019&locations=DK&start=2012\n650\n700\n750\n800\n850\n900\n2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\nWPP •\n\nBased on the figure , one cannot notice a clear immediate impact of Denmark’s first waste \nprevention programme (2013 - ) on total waste generation .

Thus, it is no t always economically attractive for the \nmunicipal waste companies to prepare such products for reuse/ recycling. To recovery as much as \npossible with a practical value, s ome recycling stations train employees to be able to assess the value \nof the products used so that these employees can sort the sal eable items for their own second -hand \nshops. Several recycling stations carry out sorting and cleaning of many products before these go on \nto re use . A number of recycling stations also repair incoming products ( e.g. furniture and white \ngoods) which are sold in their thrift stores .

Instead, a resource strategy and plan for waste management (Denmark Without Waste, Recycle more – Incinerate less) as well as a waste prevention strategy (Denmark Without Waste II, Strategy for Waste Prevention) have been adopted. Both strategies partly cover the theme of more efficient use of resources. Scope of material resource efficiency The term 'resource efficiency' and the scope (i.e., which resources are addressed) are not explicitly defined in the strategies. The focus of the Danish resource strategy (Denmark Without Waste) is on waste management with emphasis on increased recycling. The waste prevention strategy (Denmark Without Waste II) focus on increased resource efficiency in companies in general and with specific focus on five waste streams – avoidable food waste, construction and demolition, textiles, electronics and packaging. Driving forces for material resource efficiency Material resource efficiency policies and strategies in Denmark are closely related to considerations regarding job creation/employment, competitiveness as well as ensuring sustainable use of natural resources and reducing environmental impacts. A specific driver for the Denmark without waste strategies was and is the uncertainty of access to and price fluctuations on raw materials. Material resource efficiency in companies is foremost driven by cost savings (Southern Danish University 2015). Other possible drivers for companies are less dependency on volatile prices on materials and fuels, export of resource efficient solutions (e.g.in water and food production) and less environmental impacts due to regulation. Country profile DENMARK 2015 review of material resource efficiency policies in Europe 8 Priority material resources and sectors Priority materials Denmark has not identified prioritized materials as such. Several types of materials are addressed in the strategies and policies mentioned below. Among these construction materials (e.g. bricks), wood, WEEE, textiles, packaging and food waste. The drivers for focusing on these materials have been a mixture of economic, environmental and social priorities. Priority industries and economic sectors The Denmark without waste II – Strategy for waste prevention pays specific attention to increased resource efficiency in construction & demolition, food, electronics, textiles and packaging. Manufacturing has the highest share of production cost related to material use and material resource efficiency in these productions streams. They are therefore of high importance for the Danish competitiveness. In Manufacturing the sectors with the highest relative production cost for use of materials are Food and beverages (58 %), Machinery (10 %) and Manufacturing of metals (7 %) (Copenhagen Economics 2013 - http://www.copenhageneconomics.com/dyn/resources/Publication/publica tionPDF/7/267/0/Ressourceproduktivitet%20og%20konkurrenceevne%20i %20dansk%20industri.pdf). Also, the construction sector has the largest volume in material use in Denmark (Denmark without waste – recycle more, incinerate less”.) and is another area of high priority for material efficiency in Denmark. Priority consumption categories Focus is on housing, mobility and food. More recently focus has also been on textiles, packaging and EEE as well. Country profile DENMARK 2015 review of material resource efficiency policies in Europe 9 Policy framework National strategies or action plans for (material) resource efficiency Although Denmark does not have a dedicated material resource efficiency strategy or action plan, several strategies and policies are in place which address material resource efficiency among other topics.

The work will be based on anthropological studies of the experiences of companies. Studies will look into both material flows, value-chains and regulatory regimes. For each selected barrier, a solution team will be established to find the most effective way in which it can be overcome. A “barrier\" in this context means regulations (broadly understood as the rules themselves, the way they are carried out, and the service-level around them) that inhibit companies in Denmark from acting in more resource efficient ways. https://groenomstilling.erhvervsstyrelsen.dk/danish-task-force-resource-efficiency Country profile DENMARK 2015 review of material resource efficiency policies in Europe 10 5) Fund for Green Business Development.

The Growth Plan contains a total of 40 main initiatives. As many of the main initiatives consist of several sub-components, in practice 88 initiatives will have to be followed up. Almost all these initiatives were either implemented in 2013 as described in the Growth Plan or are currently being implemented. http://www.evm.dk/publikationer/2013/12-03-13-danmark-i-arbejde-vaekstplan-for-vand-bio-og-miljoe 10) Green industrial symbiosis. Green industrial symbiosis is an initiative at the Fund for Green Business Development. The initiative encourages and facilitates that more Danish companies explore the benefits of symbiosis partnerships by helping companies to recognize the value of their byproducts and assisting them to make connections Country profile DENMARK 2015 review of material resource efficiency policies in Europe 11 across traditional value chains. The initiative has a website where inspiration for initiating industrial symbiosis and case stories are published: https://groenomstilling.erhvervsstyrelsen.dk/green-industrial-symbiosis General policy objectives for material resource efficiency “Denmark without waste – recycle more, incinerate less”. http://eng.mst.dk/topics/waste/denmark-without-waste/ 1) incinerate less waste and be better at exploiting the value and resources it contains, 2) reduce environmental impacts from waste, 3) high quality recycling, 4) stronger public-private collaboration in regards to waste management. “Denmark without waste II – Strategy for Waste Prevention”. Prevention of production of waste among companies and consumers. http://mst.dk/media/131357/danmark_uden_affald_ii_web_29042015.pdf The strategy contains 72 specific initiatives to help prevent waste, spread across two cross-cutting themes and five focus areas: 1) Food waste, 2) Construction and demolition, 3) Clothes and textiles, 4) Electronics, 5) Packaging. The key objective of the first cross-cutting theme; “Transition in Danish Businesses - Effective use of materials” is that Danish businesses become better at producing more with less (material) input, contributing to an increased resource efficiency. This work area focuses on helping Danish businesses become more resource efficient. It will achieve this through a series of different initiatives focusing on: financing for a transition to more sustainable production, innovation and partnerships, resource efficiency and environmental leadership, and building and sharing knowledge on resource efficiency in businesses of all sizes and across sectors. The key objective of the second cross-cutting theme; “Green Consumption - Wise purchasing” is to make it is easier for consumers to buy products and services that have reduced resource footprints, have fewer hazardous Country profile DENMARK 2015 review of material resource efficiency policies in Europe 12 substances, and generate less waste. This work will help consumers buy products and services that are more resource efficient, healthier and better for the environment. This will be achieved through a collection of specific initiatives that will help citizens avoid waste, support better public procurement toward a green transition, and integrate waste prevention into consumer product design. Specific objectives for the five focus areas are: Food waste: -To reduce food waste in all parts of the value chain for food Construction and Demolition: -To ease the possibilities to act resource efficient within the construction and demolition sector, and that problematic substances are to be handled in a health- and environmentally sound way, and to ensure better knowledge sharing across the sector. Clothes and Textiles: -To ease the possibilities for textile companies to reduce the environmental impact in the production phase, and to make it easier to reuse and recycle textiles, among other things by reducing the problematic substances within textiles. Electronics: -To ease reuse and recycling of electronics and electronic waste, in order to enhance the longevity of the products, and to support that they, to a greater extend, can be part of circular loops. Packaging: -To reduce environmental impact from packaging. Resource efficiency and the circular economy Circular economy is high on the political agenda, but there is no official policy on closing the material loops. Denmark without waste II, Strategy for Waste Prevention points to the fact that companies can design products in a way where they can enter back into new production. In combination the Strategy for Waste Prevention (Denmark without waste II and the Strategy for Waste Management (Denmark without waste) aims at better use of valuable resources throughout production and in waste streams, e.g. from electronic and electrical products, construction materials, packaging, textiles and organic waste, including the food sector. Country profile DENMARK 2015 review of material resource efficiency policies in Europe 13 The Danish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as well as the Danish Business Authority (DBA) joined the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Circular Economy 100 initiative in 2014. EPA and DBA have also contributed to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Circular Economy Policy Toolkit report launched in June 2015: http://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/publications/delivering-the-circular-economy-a-toolkit-for-policymakers As part of this work, a case study in the potential for Denmark in the circular economy was published: https://groenomstilling.erhvervsstyrelsen.dk/sites/default/files/media/201 51113_denmarkcasestudy_finalv02.pdf A number of the initiatives that are focused on resource efficiency and green business models also cover circular economy business development, including as examples: the fund for green business development; the training programme for employees on resource efficiency, and the growth program for SME’s. Targets and indicators Targets for material resource efficiency policies The Denmark without waste strategy contain a 2022 goal for household waste (number 1) and a number of expected effects for the service sector and all waste streams: 1) Recycling of organic waste, paper, cardboard, glass, wood, plastic and metal waste from households: 50 % by 2022, 2) Collection of waste electronic equipment from the service sector: 75 % by 2018, 3) Recycling of paper, cardboard, glass, metal and plastic packaging from the service sector: 70 % by 2018, 4) Recycling of organic waste from the service sector: 60 % by 2018, 5) Energy recovery from garden waste from all waste streams: 25 % by 2018, 6) Collection of waste electronic equipment from all waste streams: 65 % by 2018, Country profile DENMARK 2015 review of material resource efficiency policies in Europe 14 7) Collection of batteries from all waste streams: 55 % by 2018, 8) Recovery of shredder waste from all waste streams: 70 % by 2018, 9) Recycling of phosphorus in sewage sludge from all waste streams: 80 % by 2018. Indicators to monitor use of materials and resource efficiency: Denmark compiles an annual growth and competitiveness publication which in recent years, among other aspects, include an indicator on creation of value compared to material costs in industry. This is compared across countries. Data based on WIOD. Link to latest publication from 2014: http://www.evm.dk/publikationer/2014/09-09-14-redegoerelse-om-vaekst-og-konkurrenceenve-2014 Recently, Statistic Denmark supported by the Danish Business Authority and The Danish EPA has developed a number of indicators to assess resource efficiency at sector levels. The indicators include among others GVA/input (DKK), purchase of input materials (DKK) as percentage of turnover (DKK), intensity of energy use (GJ) and waste production (kg) per GVA. These gives detailed information for the different sectors. At national level Denmark also use DMC to measure material resource use in tonnes. http://www.statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/default.asp?w=1280 Policy instruments Most important policy instruments for material resource efficiency. Denmark use a mix of policy instruments. Examples include: - Taxes and charges in order to for example prevent production of waste, e.g. charge on plastic bags, charge on nickel-cadmium batteries. Tax on deposits. - Mind the Trash: An online learning portal on waste and resources for 4th-6th grade in the Danish elementary school. http://mindthetrash.dk/ Country profile DENMARK 2015 review of material resource efficiency policies in Europe 15 - Eco-labeling – The EU Eco label and the Nordic Swan Eco-label: Revenue from Nordic Ecolabel products and services was greater than DKK 6 bn. in 2013 (wholesale prices excluding taxes and charges), corresponding to an increase of more than 400% from DKK 1.2 bn. in 2008. In 2014, there were more than 10000 different products and services with the Nordic Ecolabel in Denmark. In 2014, additional initiatives were launched to increase the number of ecolabelled products available in Danish supermarkets. http://www.ecolabel.dk/da/in-english - Green Public Procurement, including the specific initiatives below: o The Forum for Sustainable Procurement was established in 2011 as a “knowledge hub” and a networking organisation for greening procurement. In 2015, the Forum develops actions and communications across three thematic groups: circular economy, total cost of ownership and market dialogue. http://www.ansvarligeindkob.dk/ o The Danish EPA and the Capital Region are engaged in a Horizon2020 project on greening public procurement in regions via developing regional networks focusing on capacity building, training and pilot projects. As a part of the project, the Danish EPA is responsible for developing a tool on circular economy in a public procurement context. The Danish EPA has developed tools for Total Cost of Ownership within five product areas (published January 2015): office equipment, toilets, lightning, self-service machines and fridges and freezers. The focus is to assist public procurers in assessing the total cost of the product including maintenance costs, water and waste costs etc. http://mst.dk/virksomhed-myndighed/groen-strategi/groenne-indkoeb/totalomkostninger/ Examples of good practice Raising awareness of advantages of resource efficiency and best practices In 2015, the Danish EPA published Stærkere uden spild (Stronger without waste) http://mst.dk/media/130580/staerkere-uden-spil_web-enkel.pdf Case studies on resource efficiency in SME’s. The 14 case studies provide inspiration and advice for companies aiming to improve both their economic performance and environmental profile. SME’s can save money by becoming more resource efficient. The companies are from different industries and service industries, and they are motivated to make a difference for the environment. By means of recycling one of the companies has saved over 15 per cent of their spending on the purchase of new materials and a further 15 per cent on the cost of waste management. Country profile DENMARK 2015 review of material resource efficiency policies in Europe 16 The case studies aims to do away with the prejudice that SMEs do not have the ability to engage in environmentally friendly initiatives. Policy instruments to enable resource efficiency:  Green21 (November 2012): Green21.dk comprises 11 green tools to help especially small and medium-sized enterprises with their voluntary strategic environmental initiatives. The portal offers enterprises advice and guidance with regard to designing more green products, it has a quick guide to ecolabelling, tools to calculate total costs of purchases and inspiration to strengthen enterprises’ green competitiveness. The portal is the result of a collaboration between the Confederation of Danish Industries, the Danish EPA, Aalborg University and Green Cross Denmark. A new tool to help enterprises reduce their waste has just been added, and, finally, training seminars for enterprises, business incubators and consultants have also been conducted recently. http://www.green21.dk/  Fund for Green Business Development. The fund invests in the development of new green business models, innovative green products and services in the circular economy. The fund invests in enterprises and partnerships through application rounds and thematic programs. In 2013 – 2014, the fund has given almost € 8 million in grants to 117 innovative projects. https://groenomstilling.erhvervsstyrelsen.dk/fund-green-business-development  The Danish Eco-innovation Program The Danish Eco-innovation Program (MUDP) supports development of better solutions for Danish as well as global environmental challenges within the areas of responsibility of the Danish Ministry of the Environment and Food, including water, climate-change adaptation, air pollution, waste and resources, chemicals and noise. During the period 2008-2014, 357 development and demonstration projects received funding from the Programme. The total budget for the projects is DKK 875 mill.; the Danish Ministry of the Environment and Food provided DKK 359 mill. of this funding. The Programme was evaluated in 2013. A total of 47% of the participating enterprises had achieved increased employment or expected to do so, while 27% of enterprises had either already achieved increased exports or expected to do so. http://eng.ecoinnovation.dk/the-danish-eco-innovation-program/  Danish Green Investment Fund: As part of the “Making Denmark Greener” agreement, a new Danish Green Investment Fund has been established. The objective of the Fund is to accelerate Denmark’s green transition by offering loans at reasonable terms Country profile DENMARK 2015 review of material resource efficiency policies in Europe 17 for investments in e.g. energy savings, renewable energy plans and improving resource-efficiency. The Fund’s total loans amount to up to DKK 5 bn. http://gronfond.dk/en/om-fonden/  Task Force for Increased Resource Efficiency (June 2014): With the ”Growth Package Agreement, June 2014”, the Government established a cross-institutional Task Force between the Ministry of the Environment and Food and the Ministry of Business and Growth to identify and overcome regulatory barriers to increasing resource-efficiency. The Task Force aims to identify any barriers for enterprises to increasing their resource-efficiency, thereby benefiting the environment, innovation and productivity. Moreover the Task Force is to promote more efficient and up-to-date regulation and propose simplification of rules and regulations. Finally, the Task Force will also propose changes and modifications to existing regulations with a view to promoting resource-efficiency, innovation and green transition. The work will be based on anthropological studies of the experiences of companies. Studies will look into both material flows, value-chains and regulatory regimes. For each identified barrier a solution team will be established to find the most effective way in can be overcome. A “barrier\" in this context means regulations (broadly understood as the rules themselves, the way they are carried out, and the service-level around them) that inhibit companies in Denmark from acting in more resource efficient ways. The Task Force will be active until the end of 2017. https://groenomstilling.erhvervsstyrelsen.dk/danish-task-force-resource-efficiency  Green industrial symbiosis. Green industrial symbiosis is an initiative at the Fund for Green Business Development. The initiative encourages and facilitates that more Danish companies explore the benefits of symbiosis partnerships by helping companies to recognise the value of their byproducts and assisting them to make connections across traditional value chains. https://groenomstilling.erhvervsstyrelsen.dk/green-industrial-symbiosis Country profile DENMARK 2015 review of material resource efficiency policies in Europe 18 Institutional setup and stakeholder involvement Institutional set up for material resource efficiency policies Material resource efficiency policies are addressed by a number of different ministries in Denmark: Ministry of the Environment and Food; Ministry of Business and Growth; Ministry of Transport and Buildings; Ministry of Energy, Supply and Climate; Ministry of Taxation; Ministry of Finance. These ministries work closely together on developing policies and regulation on material resource efficiency. Process to ensure stakeholder participation In Denmark, public consultations are an integrated part of the process when policies and regulations are being developed or revised. A number of partnerships between stakeholders in value chains are being set up to increase resource efficiency. Among others, these include partnerships on food waste, recycling and prevention of construction waste and packaging waste. Suggestions for international support mechanism to exchange experiences and share lessons from the implementation of material resource efficiency policies Regular meetings between national experts and with the EU Commission, would provide value and insight in regards to experiences and future EU policy and regulation. Further development of useful indicators for resource efficiency at EU and international level, e.g. in relation to the Sustainable Development Goals."

Introduction\nWaste management is a great challenge for islands where policies, programs and projects should account for peculiarities such as the typical seasonal fluctuation of inhabitants throughout the year and the complexity of operations due to inherent spatial constraints. The challenge is exacerbated when taking into consideration current consumption and production patterns, characterized by a high level of waste generation per capita (Iyamu et al., 2020). In this context, the present paper intends to contribute to this issue by investigating the factors that can influence the changes in waste systems. The study was carried out on the Danish Island of Bornholm, in the Baltic Sea Region, with a population of 39,552 as per January 1, 2022 (Bornholm Municipality, 2022). Bornholm has an area of 588 square kilometers and is a popular tourist destination with approximately 600,000 visits annually (Horesta, 2022), with accompanying seasonality in the number of inhabitants throughout the year which reflects in the waste generated. Approximately 80,000 metric tons of waste in total is generated from all sources annually (i.e. from households and commercial sources), of which 5,4 % is landfilled, 26,9 % incinerated and 67,7 % sent for recycling in 2021. Waste variability between the summer and the winter period reaches approximately 150 %.\nOne critical challenge for Bornholm is the difficulty of reaching critical mass for public services. Due to its geographical remoteness its waste management services are provided primarily by local stakeholders. This includes a waste incineration plant, a landfill, and recycling facilities, all owned and operated by the municipality. This situation has often caused the need for exemptions from national legislation.\nBornholm adopted the vision of the municipal waste company BOFA, of a waste-free Bornholm by 2032. The vision’s main goal focuses on elimination of incineration as a waste treatment strategy in accordance with the waste hierarchy. Today, approximately 26 % of the total amount of waste on Bornholm is incinerated in the sole incinerator on the island while 6 % is landfilled. The remainder is either sent for recycling or reused, e.g., through second-hand stores (Christensen et al., 2021). According to the vision, incineration and landfilling will both be eliminated by 2032 and all waste will be either recycled or reused while also increasing focus on waste prevention. This positions Bornholm as determined to carry out a radical change from a linear to a circular economy (Christensen, 2022), and will have implications for society at large that goes beyond the technical issues.\nUnderpinning guidance for the 2032 Vision has been the concept of provisioning of public value (Moore, 1995) and of benefiting from constraints (Elster, 1977), i.e., converting Bornholm’s geographical characteristics into opportunities. The vision further stresses that results of changing from linear to circular economy will be scalable and transferrable nationally and internationally. Scalability is important. Other islands and small communities are also working with sustainability issues. for example Vlieland Island in the Netherlands carries out active studies on circular business models in association with its energy self-sufficient goals (Metabolic, 2017) but often islands and small communities do not have the complexity (agrarian, industry, rural, urban, etc.) to be able to scale the results to national and international levels. However, it is the ambition of BOFA that the implementation of the vision has scalability potential and benefits several sectors/dimensions such as tourism, job creation, education, businesses, nature and climate.\nThis paper seeks to answer the following question: What factors should be considered that influence local stakeholders' adherence to changes in the waste system within an island? Besides its theoretical dimension the answer to this question has a pragmatic relevance, as it is instrumental to support the implementation of BOFA´s 2032 vision and, hopefully, can contribute to those involved in establishing policies and strategies for island waste management elsewhere around the world. Notice that the concept of “waste system” here is concerned with the related physical elements, from generation to final disposal, as well as waste hierarchy elements.\nPrevious participatory studies on waste management provided limited contributions to understand the factors that could influence the selection and adoption of new practices and technologies on waste management within islands. Back-casting, the most common foresight tool for islands, could benefit from a deeper understanding about these factors, avoiding the need to adapt parameters to the specities islands contexts. Fuldauer et al. (2019), for instance, has adopted KPIS in association with SDG goals when carrying out a back-casting on their investigation of scenarios of waste management within islands.\nThe literature review has unveiled that most studies focus on the factors that affect waste generation and not so much on the factors that affect the direction of changes in the waste system. Diaz-Farina et al. (2020), for instance, has investigated factors that impact waste generation (ex: consumption patterns, population size, average age of population, household size and climate) including both demand and supply side perspectives. The topic has received more attention in non-island contexts, with investigations on issues such as factors that affect public acceptance and engagement or strategies to overcome public resistance waste to waste management practices (Caferra et al., 2023; Moustairas et al., 2022).\n2. Theoretical background\n2.1. The complexity of waste management within islands\nThe geographical peculiarities of islands present several challenges with regards to waste handling. Some of these peculiarities include a) high per-capita infrastructure costs; b) remoteness; c) restricted resource availability; d) lack of scale and, for many islands, d) high dependence on tourism (Fuldauer et al., 2019). Islands are directly affected by marine litter pollution, depending on their location and urban development characteristics, where a portion of the waste can be traced elsewhere in the globe (Verlis and Wilson, 2020).\nWithin the theme of tourism, the literature describes that waste handling is complicated due to many islands having a large tourist industry (Estay-Ossandon and Mena-Nieto, 2018; Panaretou et al., 2017; Camilleri-Fenech et al., 2018; Skordilis, 2004), which is often seen among Mediterranean Islands and Small Island Developing States (SIDS). The study of Diaz-Farina et al. (2020) estimated that main tourism activities generated 0,40 kg of mixed waste per tourist daily whilst residential and economic sectors account for 1,19 kg per resident daily. Hence, seasonal fluctuation puts a high strain on the waste management system within islands with variability up to 40 % in waste amounts during the course of a year.\nThe scale issue deals with critical mass resource availability and waste treatment and logistics options. The need for transportation in association with the lack of critical population mass is exacerbated with the relative remoteness of islands. Because of such context, Mancini et al. (2017) suggest viewing islands as “self-contained waste management systems, with the goal of maximizing the recovery, whilst limiting transportation costs”. Wang et al. (2021) takes a skeptical perspective, suggesting that in the case of small islands it is not possible to practice waste reduction as they depend on imported goods.\nThe general literature on waste management on islands is centered mostly on tropical islands and (in a European setting) on Mediterranean islands. In the context of islands in developing countries the literature shows that the lack of financial resources adds further to the complexity of carrying waste management. As an example, Mohee et al. (2015) provided an overview of 52 island communities in the developing world and their individual states with regard to both collection schemes and waste treatment. They find that waste management is a matter of great concern, particularly for SIDS and that sustainable waste management practices, previously absent, are now emerging although there still are many difficulties in the implementation of these practices.\nIn the Mediterranean area the studies on the topic of waste management are propelled by the sheer number of islands, their popularity as tourist destinations, and the work of organizations such as Network of Sustainable Greek Islands and The Conference of Peripheral Maritime Regions. Although under a wealthier context, the studies on the Mediterranean area point to many similar findings regarding the factors that influence changes in the waste system. In a study of the Canary Islands, Santamarta et al. (2014) find that the common problems affecting waste handling on all islands are “Reduced number of facilities for treatment or disposal; importance of tourism; high population density; limited territory to locate landfills; difficult to achieve economies of scale; transportation of waste to the mainland” (p 163). They recommend decreasing waste generation as the most successful strategy to overcome these challenges, whereas Vilms and Voronova (2016) suggest focusing on financing the waste handling system primarily through additional charges and fees on the tourist sector.\nConcerning the “strengths” issue, Eckelman et al. (2014) analyze conditions on a number of islands and conclude somewhat similarly with Santamarta et al. (2014) that the most severe waste handling problems stem from “limited land resources, high energy costs, large seasonal fluctuations in waste volumes, and complex social and political dynamics.” (p 306). On the positive side, they also point out the strength of islands as a base for model systems as islands tend to be “tractable in their size and physical complexity, naturally bounded on a systems level, with unique biophysical and socio-cultural assets, and with political (and accounting) systems that generally match geographic boundaries.” (p 307). Despite this potential strength of islands, Wang et al. (2021) calls attention to the fact that, in the case of small islands where there are few landfill options, governments often resort to open dumps and open-pit solid waste burning.\nThe literature that describes circular economy aspects within islands often tend to focus on peripheral issues to waste management such as sewage (Levlin, 1999) or the tourism industry (Matecki, 2020). Most literature, however, describes islands where landfilling is still an important waste treatment strategy and incineration is not used. Thus, the situation described in these places is not comparable with nor entirely relevant to the vision set for Bornholm in 2032. In more general terms, the literature review showed that research on studies on specific characteristics of the Baltic Sea Islands is still sparse.\n2.2. Integrated sustainable waste management\nThe investigation into the factors that affect changes on waste systems in an island requires a holistic perspective considering the specific local characteristics and needs. Weekes et al. (2021) argues that each island is a territory with a peculiar mix of factors and a waste management system derived must be customized according to these factors, encompassing the socioeconomic, cultural, economic, legislative, institutional and environmental context of the territory.\nAmong the various models to achieve this holistic perspective is the ISWM (Integrated Sustainable Waste Management) Model, which connects on one hand technical and social aspects and, on the other hand, enables to set a more complete picture of a waste system (Guerrero et al., 2013). The resulting holistic view minimizes the risk of overlooking important issues by stressing the connectivity of the different elements of the waste system. This differs from a number of other models that might primarily focus on technical issues, such as waste hierarchy or on organization issues such as the public value as per Moore (1995). Fig. 1 illustrates the ISWM model proposed by Anschütz et al. (2004), with its emphasis on all elements of the process including waste streams and stakeholders.\n\n\nDownload: Download high-res image (181KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\n\nFig. 1. The ISWM model (Anschütz et al., 2004).\nThe ISWM Model has been used as an analytical tool in several large comparative studies such as Wilson et al.’s (2013) which included 20 cities and on Christensen’s (2018) which compared two countries. Gopal et al. (2018) use ISWM models to identify drivers and barriers for system integration in India. However, while the ISWM model has been used extensively in low and middle-income countries, it is less often used in the analysis of matured waste handling systems in high-income countries.\nAnother attempt to provide a more holistic and integrated perspective on the factors that can affect waste systems is the proposition provided by Kirchherr et al. (2017), which integrate circular economy strategies with the waste hierarchy levels. Their proposition derived from a study that revised 114 definitions of circular economy, resulting on the relationships between circular economy and the waste hierarchy as illustrated on Fig. 2:\n\n\nDownload: Download high-res image (303KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\n\nFig. 2. Connections between circular economy and the waste hierarchy (Kircherr et al., 2017).\nUpon examination of the different strands of literature for the present study, the ISWM framework was selected as the most suitable model. Despite its most common usage in middle and low-income countries, the ISWM framework excels by having a holistic perspective on waste systems including both social and technical elements and stressing the connectivity of various issues identified in the literature. In contrast, the circular economy and waste hierarchy model proposed by Kircherr et al. (2017) lacks the social element in particular. As Bornholm is striving to change from a linear to circular economy starting from the waste sector, the ISWM framework was considered to be suitable as it narrows on waste systems as a unit of analysis with importance placed on the social element as well as the technical waste system elements and their inter-relations.\n3. Research method\nThe research problem of this investigation could be characterized as having a descriptive nature since a variety of factors that influence changes in waste systems are already described in the literature, although with a reduced amount of studies into the relevance of these factors for the idiosyncrasies of island contexts. According to McCartan and Robson (2016) descriptive research aims to accurately and systematically describe a population, situation or phenomenon, enabling the answer of what, where, when and how questions, but not why questions. Hence, under such context the investigation has selected Survey as the main research method. Other authors within this theme have also adopted a similar research method strategy. Moustairas et al. (2022), for instance, have investigated factors that influence environmental awareness also using Survey as the research method.\nThe survey consists of two parts: part 1: background and general questions: deals with background variables such as gender, age, income and educational level, and housing type; part 2: it consists of questions generated based on the ISWM model (Waste System Element Perspective Questions).\nThe interviewees for the qualitative part of the research were selected using ISWM as a guide. Thus, interviewees representing all the relevant stakeholders mentioned such as local authorities, NGOs, users, private sector (formal and informal) were all identified. Recruiting was primarily based on foreknowledge of the sector and to a lesser degree on snowball sampling (Bryman et al., 2019) particularly in order to identify representatives of the “user” stakeholder group.\nThe reviewed literature about the ISWM framework offered insights to interconnected perspectives in a waste system but did not necessarily offer propositions that could be directly transformed into hypotheses for Bornholm’s waste system. To analyze the expectations in the hypotheses the data was run through a Z-test (Bryman et al., 2019) as a chosen statistical testing method. The range of possible values for the statistic test was divided into two parts: an Acceptance Region, and a Critical Region.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, all interviews were performed and recorded using a web-based video conference platform. No interviews were carried out face-to-face. The average interview lasted between 20 and 30 min. The interviews were semi-structured with emphasis on open-ended questions using probing and prompting (Weller et al., 2018). The interviews were subsequently coded (Bryman et al., 2019) and a point of saturation was reached where no new themes arose through the coding process (Kvale, 2007, Lowe et al., 2018). In this process a series of themes were identified of which four were recurring in a substantial number of interviews: a) the municipality’s leadership role; b) the information deficit; c) the acceptance of increased cost, and d) the opportunities for new and strengthened partnerships. All interviews were conducted in Danish, the native tongue of the interviewees, and the coding was based on the Danish language interviews. Thus, only those parts which are quoted in the paper, have been translated into English.\n4. Results\n4.1. Implementation of the survey\nThe implementation of a Survey which was conducted April–May 2021 with 1049 respondents out of 3325 sampled, i.e. a response rate of 35.4 %. Indeed, the survey was deemed sufficient to provide statistically significant results, as a figure of 500 respondents for Bornholm’s population could have been acceptable (Krejcie and Morgan, 1970). The study has a high rate of response when compared to similar studies such as the work of Moustairas et al. (2022), which achieved 1 % of the island population. The Integrated Sustainable Waste Management (ISWM) framework (Guerrero et al., 2013) provided the structure of the questioning framework. As stated earlier in this paper the results regarding the dimension of “waste system elements” of ISWM are reported.\nThe first part of the survey, which deals with background variables such as gender, age, income and educational level, provides the socio-economic profile of the respondents. Table 1 provides the main characteristics of the survey respondents (gender, age and educational level) against their correspondent household's annual gross income (in DKK, the Danish currency1). It is worth mentioning that 44 % of the respondents are over 60 years old, 50 % are male and 50 % are female, and 43 % have technical education:\nTable 1. Socio-economic profile of the survey respondents.

In these series of questions, respondents were asked about their attitudes to changes in waste collection schemes to a more-refined curbside collection method, and the technical artifacts that these changes will result in, i.e. bins and waste sorting at home (Questions 8–9). Additionally, respondents were asked about their attitudes about where the treatment of their waste occurs, whether on the island of Bornholm or off-island, as well as their attitude to knowing about what happens to their waste once they dispose of it (Questions 10–11). Respondents were also asked about whether their consumption practices take due consideration to environmental and packaging considerations, and the importance they placed on avoiding overconsumption (Questions 12–13). Respondents’ reuse behavior and attitudes were the subject of a few questions, where they were asked about the frequency of discarding and taking items for reuse, respectively, and whether they thought further reuse platforms were needed (Questions 14–16). Finally, respondents were asked a key question about their attitude toward reuse and recycling versus incineration, including due consideration to the economics of waste incineration perhaps being the cheaper treatment option. It can be observed among the responses for Question 8 (see Fig. 3) that they are distributed almost perfectly symmetrically in bell-curve fashion with most respondents adhering to the statement square in the middle: “neither easy nor difficult”. This shows a neutral attitude to the question as the majority opinion, though could also be taken to indicate a polarization of the matter.\n\n\nDownload: Download high-res image (188KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\n\nFig. 3. Attitudes to a more-refined curbside collection method.\nAs for Question 9, Fig. 4 shows that while 25 % of respondents believe it to be “Difficult” or “Very difficult” to live up to using a maximum of 4 waste bins, 45 % of respondents believe they would “Easily” or “Very easily” live up to it. Since a majority of respondents (58 %) live in detached houses as per the background variables with presumably enough space for up to 4 waste bins, this could be an explanatory factor behind an overall positive response to this question. However, 25 % of respondents with potential difficulties in accommodating up to 4 waste bins marked this issue as an important point of attention.\n\n\nDownload: Download high-res image (136KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\n\nFig. 4. Attitudes to changes regarding technical artifacts.\nWorth mentioning that for Question 8 and 9, the hypothesis was of a moderate level of concern and difficulty in living up to national requirements. However, the statistical tests did not support this hypothesis, although it should be noted that the tested proportion was exactly 50 %.\nAs can be observed, with respect to where waste ought to be treated in Question 10 (see Fig. 5), there is strong importance associated with this question: 31 % deem it important, and 29 % deem it very important. Conversely, only 7 % deem it less important, and 9 % deem it not important at all. While technically this question doesn’t actually correlate a high level of importance to the question with an opinion that waste should remain and be treated on Bornholm, this may be inferred from the responses. For Question 10, the hypothesis was an expectation that the geographical location of treatment was less important. The results showed that 7 % answered “Less important”. Hence, the statistical test did not result in support of this hypothesis.\n\n\nDownload: Download high-res image (125KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\n\nFig. 5. Attitudes about where the treatment of their waste occurs.\nWith respect to Question 11 (see Fig. 6), it can be observed that there are moderately high levels of importance associated with knowing what happens when waste is disposed of: 13 % of respondents deem it not important, while 15 % deem it very important, a more-or-less-equal split among the extremes. However, fully 24 % and 28 % respectively deem the question important or somewhat important. While the question isn’t able to specify whether strong levels of curiosity or strong opinions about particular waste treatment pathways are behind these responses, nonetheless the results show that the matter does preoccupy most people in their relationship with their waste. For Question 11, the hypothesis was expectation of a moderate to high level of environmental awareness. The proportion tested was the combined proportion of respondents who answered “Somewhat important” (28 %), “Important” (24 %) and “Very important” (15 %). The statistical test resulted in support of the hypothesis.\n\n\nDownload: Download high-res image (127KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\n\nFig. 6.

Importance placed on avoiding overconsumption.\nFor Questions 12 and 13, the respective hypothesis provided an expectation of a moderate to high level of environmental awareness. The proportion tested was the combined proportion of respondents who answered “Somewhat important”, “Important” and “Very important”. The statistical test resulted in support of the hypothesis. The common theme of these questions is the reuse step in the waste hierarchy.\nIn Question 14 about frequency of discarding items for reuse, 4 % never do this while 40 % do this monthly, as shown on Fig. 9.\n\n\nDownload: Download high-res image (126KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\n\nFig. 9. Frequency of discarding for re-use according to respondents.\nObservably, it is a commonplace practice to deposit items to be used again by others for the same purpose on Bornholm. Question 15 focuses on taking items for reuse. While 11 % never do this, 38 % do this only once in a while, and 24 % do this rarely.This would seem to indicate a casual practice of taking previously-owned items for personal use.\nQuestion 16deals with whether further platforms are seen as needed for reuse items. 8 % believe they lack such platforms to a high extent, and 4 % to a very high extent. 33 % believe to a lesser extent that such platforms are lacking, and 27 % have indicated that they do no not lack such platforms at all. From this, it can be reasonably observed that the market or system of reuse platforms on Bornholm is perceived to be saturated.\nQuestion 17assessed the backing or resistance to a cornerstone of Bornholm’s Vision 2032, i.e. the phase-out of waste incineration in favor of reuse and recycling even if economics may favor the former. From the results, as shown on Fig. 12, 10 % believe that the economic costs of recycling and reuse dictate that waste should be incinerated instead. This is followed by 4 % on the survey option next after that; 36 % fully back the statement that materials should be reused and recycled even if it increases financial expenses, followed by 23 % who responded on the next survey option. Taken together, there is quite a strong backing to reuse and recycling.\nFor Question 17, the hypothesis provided an expectation that the economic parameter has a moderate to high degree of influence. The proportion tested was the combined proportion of respondents who answered “4” (4 %) and “5” (10 %). The results obtained during the statistical test did not result in support of this hypothesis.\n5. Discussion\nThe research commenced with the hypotheses of a moderate level of concern and difficulty in living up to national requirements (number of fractions and number of bins). The survey results have confirmed this hypothesis, confirming this as a relevant factor to take into account when considering factors that influence changes of waste systems. Indeed, it showed a moderate acceptance from Bornholm residents regarding the implementation of more refined curbside collection methods as 29 % of the respondents find it neither easy nor difficult (Question 8) (See Fig. 3) with a more positive attitude towards changes the waste system technical artifacts, with 30 % of the answers considering it easy (Question 9) (See Fig. 4). Interestingly, the statistical tests seem to indicate that implementing a new and more refined waste separation and collection system might not be as problematic as feared.\nAnother hypothesis was not supported by the survey results. It dealt with the geographic location of waste treatment (on or off-island) which was expected to be of less importance for the inhabitants of Bornholm. The survey has shown a more holistic and responsible attitude of the island residents regarding the implication of the consumption and production practices on the planet. Indeed, 31 % of the respondents considered “important” where the treatment of their waste occurs (Question 10) (See Fig. 5). On the other hand, the results show a slightly lesser concern, yet still high, about knowing what happens to their waste once they dispose of it as 28 % find it “somewhat important” (Question 11) (See Fig. 6). These results are a strong challenge to the assumption that sending waste for treatment off-island is socially acceptable. Howell and Fielding (2019) suggest that a sense of civic duty is among the factors that can motivate or discourage more eco-efficient attitudes and opinions among island inhabitants with regards to environmental issues.\nThere was an expectation that the economic dimension of the factors that influence changes on the waste system would present a moderate to high degree of influence when considering incineration (lower cost) versus recycling and reuse (higher cost). However, the survey results showed a more positive attitude toward reuse and recycling when compared to incineration, with 36 % of the respondents considering that materials should be re-used and recycled even if it increases financial expenses. From an environmental perspective it is positive to observe that recycling or reuse, despite a higher cost, is more favored than waste incineration. Other surveys carried out in islands, such as the one carried out by Macusi et al. (2019) with students, also show a broader economic perspective of island residents when comparing waste management alternatives.\nA clear bottleneck to enable the reuse of products within Bornholm island, and a factor that influences the adherence to changes in the waste system (a central concern on the research question), is the need for more widespread availability of services such as, for instance, those aiming at upgrading and/or refurbishing the functional or aesthetic aspects of a product. This demands actions that stimulate the development of products and services suitable for the circular economy within an island boundary, enabling products to re-enter the economic cycle with reduced environmental impact (Gharfalkar et al., 2016). As argued by Ottoni et al. (2020), reuse and recycling activities are facilitated when products adopt modular configurations, facilitating their disassembly, updating/replacement and/or recycling. Such perspectives might require a revision on the business scope of waste management companies, as they conventionally focus their value proposition at the post-consumption phases. It also requires deeper collaboration and new ties with a wide range of actors as new knowledge and business competencies are required in order to create effective and meaningful value (Moalem and Kerndrup, 2022). Implementing such new perspectives in Denmark and elsewhere in Europe, faces the challenge of an ambivalent legal framework regarding the role of players in waste management, not stimulating or inducing companies to break conventional boundaries (Moalem et al., 2023).\nThe respondent’s active role on the life cycle of products is higher on proper discarding, aiming at the re-use of products (40 % report monthly practice – Question 14) (See Fig. 9). Yet, the survey results also showed a less widespread attitude towards the effective reuse of products, with 38 % report doing that “once in a while”. This, in turn, is in line with the perception of a lesser need for increasing the availability of reuse platforms (Question 15) (See Fig. 10). Notice that the effective re-use of products seems to be more an expectation directed to others than to oneself. Regardless of the motivation, these results present a positive prospect to implement a more regenerative system on Bornholm Island in which the inflows and outflows of resources could be minimized and optimized through design, maintenance, reuse, remanufacturing, renovation and recycling.\n\n\nDownload: Download high-res image (101KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\n\nFig. 10. Frequency of product re-use according to respondents.\nAlthough it is already understood that prevention of waste generation offers a more effective strategy in the long term for waste management within islands, their characteristics often demand alternative solutions to deal with severe shortages of landfills and rising operating costs (Hoang and Fogarassy, 2020). When considering the various strategies to deal with waste, these survey results suggest that the concept of Circular Economy has a more promising perspective in Bornholm. Fuldauer et al. (2019)´s findings when comparing different scenarios on SIDS, also concluded that the adoption of the Circular Economy outperforms other strategies. It requires relatively less infrastructure requirements, thus saving costs and carbon while contributing to local job creation and reducing waste treatment needs. Investments to implement Circular Economy in islands, according to Fuldauer et al. (2019) included waste reduction campaigns and the reduction of the harbour and other taxes for recyclers.\nWorth noting that the environmental awareness of the survey respondents is clearly higher at the consumption stage, as 65 % of them consider it important or somewhat important to use environmental criteria when purchasing products and avoiding packaging (Question 12) (See Fig. 7) and 26 % consider it “important” to avoid overconsumption (Question 13) (See Fig. 8). Yet, the results point out to the need for further efforts to effectively provoke deep change in consumption habits, attitudes, and opinions about product re-use. After all, as argued by Fuldauer et al. (2019), investing in education, prevention and re-use initiatives is far less expensive, nearly carbon-free, and more effective on dealing with island´s waste than spending resources on expanding building waste infrastructure. Verlis and Wilson (2020) add that the development of a greater sense of place and appreciation regarding the uniqueness of an island environment is an effective strategy to reduce waste and litter among both locals and tourists (Fig. 11 and Fig. 12).\n\n\nDownload: Download high-res image (125KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\n\nFig. 11.

Attitudes toward reuse and recycling versus incineration.\nFinally, the authors understand that the factors that influence changes in the waste system, as reported on this study, do present potential to be adopted by those investigating similar issues within island contexts. Indeed, the present study could be positioned in what Bryman et al. (2019) describes as “representative case” (p.66), though the particularities of an island geography in a high-income country may build the argument that, as per Flyvbjerg (2011), this would be a “critical case” with rich data that has “strategic importance in relation to the general problem”, in this case pertaining to linear-to-circular waste system transitions.\n6. Conclusion\nWhen implementing BOFA’s 2032 Vision, the statistical analysis showed that factors that influence the waste system change are among others the surprising high baseline level of awareness of environmental issues. Furthermore, the interests in the local (i.e. island) angle were the consideration for solutions that benefit the island as preferred over solutions based on mainland activities. There is an acceptance of increased costs when the changes are implemented but as cost rises, acceptance decreases.\nThe factors identified in this study are of particular relevance for the planning stage of participatory studies, for the content development of surveys, for the definition of the syllabus of competence development activities, for self-diagnosis tools aiming islands and waste management organizations and, also, to support wide initiatives on policy making. On this last aspect, the successful development and implementation of new policies on waste management within islands does need to consider factors and strategies to enhance the adherence of local stakeholders. The factors investigated on this paper do provide an initial framework that could support such initiatives.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\nThe contributions of each author has been distributed as follows: Jens Hjul-Nielsen: Conceptualization, Methodology, Investigation, Validation, Formal analysis, Writing – original draft, Writing – review & editing.

      "raw_content": "BRIEFING Roadmap to EU climate neutrality – Scrutiny of Member States This briefing is one in a series covering all EU Member States. EPRS | European Parliamentary Research Service Author: Liselotte Jensen with Paulina Jabczyńska; Graphics: Ville Seppälä Climate Action Research and Tracking Service, Members' Research Service PE 767.173 – December 2024 EN Denmark's climate action strategy Denmark is legally bound to reach climate neutrality by 2050 (see trajectory in Figure 1) and deliver a 70 % greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction by 2030 compared with 1990. Denmark accounts for 1.4 % of the EU's net GHG emissions, and achieved a net emissions reduction of 44.7 % from 2005 to 2023, greater than the 30.5 % EU average reduction over the same period. Emissions from sectors under the EU emissions trading system (ETS) were more than halved (-66 %). Denmark's land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector has historically been an emissions source, but in 2022 and 2023 it delivered a small sink function. For the effort-sharing sectors, Denmark over-achieved on its targets for 2020, but will need additional measures to reach the updated 2030 obligations. With its 2023 REPowerEU chapter and 2024 changes to its recovery and resilience plan (NRRP), Denmark has further increased its climate spending. Denmark submitted a draft updated national energy and climate plan (NECP) on 3 July 2023. The European Commission assessed it, making recommendations for the final updated NECP, submitted on 30 June 2024. In a 2023 survey, 74 % of Danes, compared with a 46 % EU average, identified climate change to be one of the four most serious problems facing the world. Most expect national government (77 %) and/or the EU (75 %) to tackle climate change, while 54 % find it to be a personal responsibility. Figure 1 – Denmark's greenhouse gas emissions in million tonnes (Mt), 2005-2023 Data source: European Environment Agency (EEA), 2024. EPRS | European Parliamentary Research Service 2 Denmark's starting point The Danish Climate Act, agreed on politically in December 2019, was adopted in June 2020, and includes two reduction targets. By 2030, the country should reduce its GHG emissions by 70 % compared with 1990 levels, and by 2050 at the latest, achieve climate neutrality. A key principle of the act is to maintain a welfare society while pursuing a green transition. Historical responsibilities and moral obligations are the key arguments why Denmark wants to play a leading role in global efforts to combat climate change. The act requires Denmark to set a national climate target every 5 years with a 10-year perspective. Updates cannot reduce ambitions and must be accompanied by a climate action plan, of which the first was published in June 2020. In 2021, Denmark announced an indicative target for 2025 of 50-54 % GHG emissions reductions compared with 1990. Later that same year, the country published its roadmap for a green Denmark containing specific sectoral measures and timelines. In the 2022 government coalition agreement, the parties advanced the climate neutrality target to 2045, aiming for a 110 % reduction of GHG emissions by 2050. Denmark met its 2020 EU GHG emissions, share of renewable energy and energy consumption targets. The country's over-achievement in all the target areas helped deliver the 2020 EU-level goals and make up for countries that lacked progress in those areas. Between 2005 and 2023, Denmark succeeded in reducing emissions in all sectors, except waste management. Agriculture, where emissions remained stable over most of the period, finally decreased (7 %) when including 2023 data, yet accounts for over a quarter of Danish GHG emissions. Emissions per capita in Denmark are close to the EU average, reaching 7.1 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) in 2023, which is a 45 % decrease compared with 2005. In addition, the Danish economy's carbon intensity was reduced by 54 % between 2005 and 2023, and is 45 % below the EU average. The 2024 country-specific recommendations for Denmark focus on keeping up the pace of implementation of the NRRP as well as cohesion programmes. A specific recommendation focuses on efforts for a more sustainable agriculture. In this regard, after the 2021 agreement on green transition of agriculture, the 2022 government agreement included establishing a climate tariff on agriculture. In February 2024, experts recommended three possible models including CO2 tariffs per tonne of agricultural emissions ranging from €33 to €100 (see also page 5). Similar to 2023, the 2024 country report notes the high material footprint and per capita waste generation. Denmark was the highest-ranking country in the 2025 Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI). The CCPI ranks countries based on their climate protection performance using primarily quantitative data, with experts providing qualitative evaluation of a country's forward-looking climate policies. Climate action governance Under the Climate Act, Denmark set up the Danish Council on Climate Change (DCCC), an independent expert body, to assess the government's climate efforts. The DCCC makes cost-effective policy suggestions to the minister for climate, energy and utilities, and provides a status update on the country's targets. The February 2024 DCCC assessment showed a gap of 2.6 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent (MtCO2e) in delivering on the 2030 target. The October 2024 DCCC assessment of the government's 2024 climate programme acknowledges the pathway towards the 2030 target through agreed initiatives, yet points to high risks of potential delays in implementation. Denmark has a Youth Climate Council, in which youth representatives contribute their ideas on Danish climate action. From 2020 to 2022, a Citizen's Assembly of 99 randomly selected citizens made specific climate policy recommendations. The initiative is currently under evaluation. In addition, the government established 14 climate partnerships with the Danish business community that focus on cooperation between the government and the private sector in addressing climate and green transition challenges. So far, they have presented over 400 recommendations. Danish climate adaptation focuses primarily on water management, with a web portal for tips and latest updates. A new plan with dedicated funding proposals was adopted in October 2023. Denmark's climate action strategy 3 Climate action in the national recovery and resilience plan The Danish 2021 national recovery and resilience plan (NRRP) had a REPowerEU chapter added in 2023, and several measures were modified in 2024. The 2022 revision of allocations decreased the Danish maximum grant allocation by -7.9 %. The EU financing of the Danish plan totals €1 626 million. Denmark's climate tagging, the part dedicated to climate action (see Figure 2), increased from 59 % of the original plan to 69 % in the updated plan, according to the Commission's dedicated country web page, well above the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) target of 37 %. Only two of the Danish NRRP's eight components have no climate tag. The main climate measures concern green tax reforms (for industry, company car registration, and tariffs on electricity from car charging points). Energy efficiency measures target renovation and support for replacing oil burners and gas furnaces. Research investment targets innovation in various sectors, including agriculture, industry and transport. Specific examples of investment include subsidies for bike lanes and projects on carbon-rich soils. In the plan's latest version, Denmark removed the carbon capture and storage REPowerEU action, as the tender received too few bids. Energy situation In 2022, Denmark imported (61.5 %) or produced (38.5 %) a total of 28.3 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe). Renewables, mainly wind and biofuels, constitute a large share (27.3 %) of Denmark's energy mix and are primarily produced in Denmark. However, as shown in Figure 3, oil and petroleum products remain the main fraction in the country's energy mix. Figure 3 – Energy mix and import dependency, 2022 Data source: Eurostat (nrg_bal_sd), 2024. Figure 2 – NRRP climate dimension (€ million) Data source: European Commission, 2024; graphic by Lucille Killmayer, EPRS. EPRS | European Parliamentary Research Service 4 The 2024 reopening of the Tyra oil and gas field re-established Denmark as a net-exporter of gas. Oil imports are expected to continually decrease towards 2030, when own oil-extraction is expected to peak. In 2020, a broad parliament coalition decided to end oil and gas extraction in the North Sea by 2050. In response to the energy crisis, a June 2022 reform, 'Denmark can do more II', accelerated the green transition, fast-tracking renewables and boosting Denmark's energy independence. In its NECP, Denmark has not committed to a specific target for its share of renewable energy sources (RES) in gross final consumption by 2030. In 2023, the RES share reached 43.1 % (Figure 4). Denmark acknowledges that under EU legislation, its national contribution should be close to 60 %. The final updated NECP projects a 73.8 % share of RES by 2030, taking into account key measures from numerous political agreements. These include enabling a quadrupling of energy production from photovoltaics and wind turbines on land by 2030 compared with 2021, and installing more district heating, where the RES share is projected to reach 81 % in 2030. A 2022 agreement sets the ambition for 100 % green gas by 2030, which the NECP also refers to, with the mention of specific forthcoming tenders for biomethane. Several political agreements have sought to expand offshore wind energy. The hope was to achieve at least 9 to 14 gigawatts (GW) installed capacity by 2030. The final updated NECP's RES share projections include 4 GW offshore wind. However, no bids were received on the first tender in 2024 for 3 GW, with a second tender closing on 1 April 2025. Denmark is projecting to reach 100 % renewable electricity consumption by 2028; however, as can be deducted from the final updated NECP, and as pointed out by stakeholders, this target could be in jeopardy without the 4 GW offshore wind energy. Sectoral challenges and strategies Because of the economic rebound following the pandemic, emissions rose in some sectors in 2021 compared with 2020. For 2023, data show year-on-year emissions reductions in almost all sectors. The 'other emissions' category saw a slight increase, yet remains below 2019 levels. Emissions linked to waste management were the same as in 2022. Although the waste management sector holds only a small share of Danish total emissions (2.9 %), it is the only sector in which emissions have risen since 2013. Political agreements in 2020 and 2022 increased waste tariffs and sorting in order to increase recycling and reduce overall waste generation, with a vision towards a climate-neutral waste sector by 2030. Praised as the biggest climate policy progress since the Danish Climate Act, the green tax reform in industry was adopted in June 2022, covering all industrial sectors. As shown in Figure 5 below, Denmark remained below allocations in each year covered under the Effort-sharing Decision, and delivered a 26 % emissions reduction in 2020 compared with 2005, surpassing the country's 20 % target. The Effort-sharing Regulation (ESR) sets a 50 % emissions reduction target for 2030 compared with 2005, which Denmark expects to reach with additional measures. Sectors covered by the ESR include transport, buildings, agriculture, small industrial installations, waste treatment, and fugitive emissions from energy supply and product use. The 2020 green housing agreement with €4 billion towards 2026, is the biggest-ever targeted support for Figure 4 – Renewable energy share in final energy consumption Data source: Eurostat (nrg_ind_ren), 2024. Denmark's climate action strategy 5 comprehensive refurbishment of public sector housing. The 2022 reform package focuses on expanding district heating, phasing out fossil fuels for heating, and supporting heat pumps. The transport and agriculture sectors each account for 27 % of Denmark's emissions. The overarching 2020 agreement on green transition of road transport is implementing primarily tax and tariff reforms supported by the RRF. For heavy-duty vehicles, Denmark changed from the Eurovignette to a kilometre-based road tariffs system linked to CO2 performance. In a world first, the June 2024 'deal on a green Denmark' established a CO2 emissions tax on the farming sector. Building on the experts' impact modelling, the deal was reached through a tripartite process involving the private (farmers and unions), civic (nature organisations) and public sector (local authorities and government). While the 2020 political agreement on green tax reforms aimed for carbon taxation across all sectors, analysis into agricultural competitiveness delayed the process. The November implementation agreement contains financial and technical details. The carbon tax will take effect in 2030 at €16 (DKK 120) per tonne of CO2e, rising to €40 (DKK 300) by 2035. Nature restoration is a significant part of the deal, with 140 000 hectares (ha) of carbon-rich peat soils being restored, for instance, through rewetting, thereby also reducing the release of nitrogen to aquatic areas. An estimated 1 billion trees will be planted, with reforestation of 250 000 ha of agricultural land by 2045. The total estimated cost is €5.8 billion (DKK 43 billion), which covers the purchase of agricultural lands, restoration, subsidies for green technologies, and innovation for the sector. Denmark's LULUCF sector, traditionally a source of emissions, managed a small sink function from 2022 (Figure 6), partly following new mapping of carbon-rich peat soils that reduced the areas from 172 000 ha in 2010 to 118 000 ha in 2022. By 2030, Denmark must reduce its LULUCF emissions by 441 kilotonnes of CO2e (ktCO2e) compared with its average emissions in 2016, 2017 and 2018 (where accounting adjustments may occur). In 2020, this baseline was 5 779 ktCO2e. The Commission assessment found Denmark's draft updated NECP unlikely to deliver on the country's 2030 LULUCF obligation. However, a 2024 Danish climate ministry progress report incorporating updated mapping and accounting practices estimated the country would over-achieve on the 2030 LULUCF target by -200 ktCO2e. Figure 5 – Denmark's emissions under the Effort-sharing Decision/Regulation Data source: EEA, 2024. Figure 6 – LULUCF emissions in Denmark Data source: EEA (2030 target is based on 2016-2018 baseline), 2024. EPRS | European Parliamentary Research Service 6 Latest policy developments With 10 % of Danish territory renatured, including six new national parks, the tripartite 'deal on a green Denmark' – hailed as historic – will have significant impact on Denmark's LULUCF sector. Conversely, the repercussions of the outcome of the first 3 GW offshore wind tenders, which fell short of expectations, are yet to be determined. The scale-up of offshore wind in the North Sea is not only a Danish ambition, with the 2022 Esbjerg declaration signed between Belgium, Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands, committing to reach 65 GW offshore wind in the North Sea by 2030 (boosted to 120 GW among more countries in the 2023 Ostend declaration). Following the failed tender, the energy agency is starting market dialogues to determine the cause of the lack of interest. In 2023, the government announced that, owing to cost increases and market insecurities, the planned high-profile energy islands in the Danish North Sea would have to be reconsidered. The islands were a key part of the Danish 2021 strategy for Power-to-X (PtX) with offshore hydrogen production and direct pipelines to surrounding countries. The ambitions remain unchanged, and in November 2024, Denmark signed a memorandum of understanding with the Netherlands on further cooperation on green hydrogen production, trade and infrastructure. The over-subscription of a recent PtX tender showed the strong interest in this area. A larger projects is HØST PtX in Esbjerg. Denmark aims to become a hub for carbon capture utilisation and storage (CCUS), and has concluded agreements with Belgium and the Netherlands. Three licenses for large-scale carbon capture and storage (CCS) in the Danish part of the North Sea were approved in 2023. In December 2024, the final investment decision was taken to realise commercial storage at the INEOS-led Greensands Future project, starting end-2025 or early 2026. The initial volume will be 400 000 tonnes of CO2 annually, with a potential for 8 million tonnes of CO2 annually. Denmark's CCS ambitions, too, encountered early obstacles with under-subscription of the first tender for capture of biogenic CO2, with Denmark having to remove that part under its REPowerEU targets. One of the funded projects of that tender has now signed an agreement to store its captured CO2 in the Greensands Future storage facility. Beyond pointing to risks relating to delayed implementation across initiatives towards 2030, the DCCC highlights the need to tackle Denmark's consumption-based carbon footprint. The 2022 political agreement on a Green Fund pledged to set aside funding in annual amounts. For the 2024-2040 period, these will total over €7 billion (DKK 53.5 billion).

However, challenges such as high operational costs and complex waste sorting requirements hinder market growth.\n\nOn the other hand, advancements in recycling technologies, including waste to energy and chemical recycling, present promising opportunities by enhancing efficiency and sustainability.\n\nMoreover, key players have been investing through innovative waste solutions and upgrading capacity in recycling such as Vestforbrænding, RenoNord, ARC. In future, as companies are progressing towards a healthier environment, thus the waste sector will remain among the pillars behind the fulfillment of national environmental agenda.\n\nGrowing Urban Population Necessitates the Need for Effective Waste Management Solutions\n\nThe increased urbanization rate in Denmark boosts the waste management industry as people are relocating to cities, and consequently, more waste is generated from residential, commercial, and industrial areas. In an urban setting, there is always a mix of household, packaging, and construction debris. This makes it important to ensure that such a collection recycling and disposal system is efficient.\n\nAccording to the report of World Bank, the total population living in cities of Denmark is computed at 5.22 million for the year of 2022. The rate has escalated at 0.97% in the last year, according to the report. This urban rising stream creates wastes and must be supported by heavily advanced infrastructure in the form of centralised sorting facilities and programs for urban recycling. Secondly, urbanization creates the opportunities of adopting latest technology to improve processes of waste management and decrease environmental degradation in urban areas.\n\nIncreasing Rate of Recycling in Denmark Increases Demand for Waste Management Solutions\n\nThe increasing focus on recycling in Denmark, supported by ambitious sustainability objectives, established the country as a leader in waste management. Denmark’s robust recycling mandates and waste separation practices at both residential and industrial levels aim to minimize landfill dependency while maximizing resource recovery.\n\nAccording to a report published by the European Environment Agency, the rate of collected municipal waste is projected to be recycled at 55% for the year 2025 as compared with the preceding years.\n\nInvestment in advanced technologies and infrastructure concerning recycling is critical in attaining these objectives such as automated systems for sorting municipal waste and specialist facilities for dealing with plastics, metals, or organic waste. These initiatives fall under Denmark's broad agenda of enhancing a circular economy and environmental sustainability.\n\nRapidly Growing Industrial and Commercial Sector Fuels the Demand for Waste Management Solutions\n\nOver the years, Denmark has seen large portions of growth in industrial and commercial sectors, which meant more waste was produced there. The industry contributes much waste either hazardous or non-hazardous.\n\nAccording to United Nations Environment Programme, for the year 2023, almost 1.1 million tons of hazardous waste is produced per capita in Denmark. The figure would also continue to rise since more and more enterprises are looking to have sound waste management systems in place, which would include factors like recycling, resource recovery, and waste-to-energy. This demand for sector-specific waste management services is a key driver of the Denmark waste management market growth, fostering innovation and the expansion of specialized waste handling and disposal infrastructure.\n\nStringent Government Regulations Towards Waste Management Hinders the Denmark Waste Management Market Expansion\n\nDenmark waste management industry operates within a framework of stringent environmental regulations set forth by both national and European Union authorities. Denmark's EPA, the Danish Waste Management Act, and directives from the EU such as the Waste Framework Directive, and the Circular Economy Action Plan are major sources of regulation.\n\nIt is quite challenging and resource-intensive to adhere to the mentioned regulations about segregated waste, recycling targets, and landfill reductions. All this regulatory complexity leads to increased operational costs and a risk of delays in the implementation of the system.\n\nAdoption Of Waste-To-Energy Technologies Creates Future Growth Opportunities in the Market\n\nThe adoption of waste-to-energy technologies such as incineration, anaerobic digestion, and gasification presents a significant growth opportunity for the waste management market as these technologies would reduce landfill dependency and contribute toward sustainable energy generation. Waste management solutions that convert waste into a valuable resource have a positive effect on environmental sustainability and drive expansion in the Denmark waste management market trends.\n\nThis new approach adheres to a global trend to embrace circular economy practices and promotes economic benefits with the generation of energy from wastes that present promising growth avenues in the waste management sector. It also added new sets of challenging goals through a Green Transition Plan and Climate Action Act by Denmark, which targeted reducing landfill wastes and increasing their renewable energy resource usage.\n\nThese policies boost investment in WTE infrastructure, which further converts non-recyclable waste into valuable energy and contributes to waste reduction and renewable energy targets for Denmark. The government also proposed a reduction of 480 kilo tons/year of waste generation and a decrease of incineration capacity from 4 million Tons/Year to 2.7 million Tons/Year.\n\nBy Waste Type, Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) or Household Dominates the Denmark Waste Management Market Share\n\nMSW constitutes 54% of Denmark Waste Management. This sector mainly comprises household waste, packaging waste, organic waste as well as recyclables coming from households. Functioning MSW management depends highly on sorting systems, waste-to-energy plants, recycling plants, and smart collection systems that improve the processing efficiency of waste while minimizing landfills and supporting Danish sustainability objectives. The integration of advanced sorting technologies and automated waste processing solutions has been instrumental in improving recycling rates and minimizing environmental impact.\n\nBy Waste Treatment, Recycling, holds the highest CAGR of 4.75%\n\nThe recycling segment in the waste management industry in Denmark is growing because of increasing regulatory emphasis on sustainability and circular economy initiatives. Technologies included in this segment are automated sorting systems, material recovery facilities, chemical recycling, and AI-powered waste classification. These solutions help in efficient separation, processing, and repurposing of recyclable materials to reduce landfill waste and help businesses and municipalities meet environmental targets.\n\nCompetitive Landscape\n\nThe key players operating in Denmark waste management industry include I/S Vestforbrænding, ARGO Roskilde Kraftvarmeværk, HCS A/S Transport & Spedition, Veolia Environnement S.A., Marius Pedersen A/S Company, Remondis, Amager Resource Center (ARC), Kredsløb Holding A/S, DP CleanTech, Nordværk (RenoNord), Energnist I/S, I/S REFA, I/S Norfors, Eldan Recycling A/S, Verdis A/S, Fortum Recycling & Waste, M&J Recycling, Resource Denmark ApS, Aerbin ApS, TOMRA Systems ASA among others.\n\n\n\nThese players are engaged in various partnership, and business expansion across various regions to maintain their dominance in the market.\n\n\n\nDate | Company | Recent Developments\nNovember 2024 | ARGO Roskilde Kraftvarmeværk | Argo expanded its direct reuse initiative by opening a new facility in Bjæverskov that aims to promote sustainability and reduce waste through community engagement.
