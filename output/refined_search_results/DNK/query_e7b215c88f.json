It builds to a large extent on the answers provided by the Danish Environmental Protection Agency in April 2021 to a questionnaire developed by the EEA and ETC/WMGE. The EEA and ETC/CE would like to thank the Danish authorities for the provided information and for the kind review of drafts of this assessment report in 2021 and April 2022. 1 Introduction 1.1 Background and purpose The Waste Framework Directive 2008/98/EC (as amended by Directive (EU) 2018/851) includes a target to recycle and prepare for reuse, by 2025, 55 % of municipal waste generated. The Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive (94/62/EC as amended by Directive (EU) 2018/852) includes targets for the recycling of packaging waste, both in total and by material, to be achieved by 2025. The Landfill Directive (1999/31/EC as amended by Directive (EU) 2018/850) requires to limit the landfilling of municipal waste to 10 % of the generated municipal waste by 2035. The Directives also foresee that the European Commission, in cooperation with the European Environment Agency, publishes early warning reports on the Member States’ progress towards the attainment of the targets, including a list of Member States at risk of not attaining the targets within the respective deadlines, three years ahead of the target dates. This assessment is a contribution from the EEA to the early warning reports according to Article 11b Waste Framework Directive and Art. 6b Packaging and Packaging Waste directive. This document is an early warning assessment for Denmark. The document is based on the analysis of a number of factors affecting recycling performance (success and risk factors). The assessment aims at concluding whether Denmark is at risk of missing the targets for municipal waste and packaging waste set in EU legislation for 2025. In addition, it provides a preliminary assessment of the prospects for meeting the 2035 target for landfilling of municipal waste. The assessment takes into account information that was available before 10 May 2022. 1.2 Approach The assessment follows a methodology developed by the EEA and ETC/WMGE and consulted with the Eionet in 2020 (ETC/WMGE, 2021), which was adjusted in 2021 taking into account experiences with applying the methodology in 2021 (ETC/CE & ETC/WMGE, 2022). This methodology uses a set of quantitative and qualitative success and risk factors that have been identified to affect the recycling performance. The assessment is to a large extent based on the information provided by the Member State in the reply to an EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire as well as on available data and information from Eurostat and other relevant sources. In addition, a consortium under contract with the European Commission (led by Rambøll Group) has conducted a critical review of the draft assessment in Q4/2021 and provided further information. More specifically, chapter 2.1 assesses the likelihood for Denmark to achieve the target to prepare for reuse and recycle at least 55 % of municipal solid waste (MSW) for 2025. Chapter 2.2 assesses the likelihood for Denmark to achieve the overall packaging waste and specific packaging materials’ recycling targets for 2025. Chapter 2.3 examines the prospects for Denmark to landfill less than 10 % of the generated municipal solid waste by 2035. The official early warning assessment for the landfilling target is only due in 2032 and accordingly, the assessment contained in Chapter 2.3 is only preliminary. 1.3 Member State profile – context parameters Municipal waste generation and treatment The annual municipal waste generation and treatment has remained rather stable in Denmark between 2016 and 2020. The municipal waste generation was around 5 million tonnes in 2020. Waste generation per capita is very high, with 845 kg/cap in 2020, which is significantly higher than the (estimated) EU average of 505 kg/cap in 2020. The country has a quite even division between waste collected for recycling and waste incineration, being 53.9 % and 45.2 % respectively in 2020. Less than 1 % is being landfilled. Waste collected for material recycling increased between 2016 and 2020 from 29.9 % to 35.5 %, while composting and digestion stagnated around 18.4 %. The recycling rate (collected for material recycling and composting and digestion) has increased from 48.3 % in 2016 to 53.9 % in 2020 (Eurostat, 2022a). Denmark has a very high incineration capacity, roughly double the amount of residual municipal waste sent to incineration in 2019. On 16 June 2020, the Danish Government and Parties representing a broad majority in the Danish Parliament agreed on a Climate plan for a green waste sector and a circular economy. The climate plan includes initiatives – amongst others – towards reducing waste and reducing the capacity for waste incineration. In order to adjust the capacity, a tender-based model is foreseen and the waste incineration plants will have to compete for the waste. Environmental requirements for the incineration plants will be tightened so that plants that lag behind environmentally either invest in technological improvements or close. Figure 1.1 Municipal waste generation and treatment in Denmark between 2016 and 2020, in thousand tonnes Notes: Provisional data for 2020 Source: Eurostat (2022a) Legal Framework The main national regulations in the area of waste are the Environmental Protection Act (Miljø- og Fødevareministeriet, 2022) and the Statutory Order on Waste (Miljøministeriet, 2020b), defining principles, responsibilities and requirements on waste prevention and management in Denmark. The Statutory Order on waste regulations, fees and actors (Klima-, Energi- og Forsyningsministeriet, 2020) covers the treatment of waste that is not regulated by other legislation, the municipalities’ regulations on waste, schemes for waste, fees for waste, assignment of waste benchmarking of waste incineration plants. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency has issued guidelines for the sorting and collection of municipal waste from households (Miljøministeriet, 2020c, 2020d). Waste management plan(s) Denmark’s National Waste Management Plan (NWMP) Action plan for circular economy - National plan for prevention and management of waste 2020-2032 (Handlingsplan for cirkulær økonomi - National plan for forebyggelse og håndtering af affald 2020-2032) was adopted by the Danish Ministry of Environment (Miljøministeriet) in 2021 (Miljøministeriet, 2021a). The plan was drawn up largely based on previous strategies, agreements, plans and revised ordinances and can thus be seen as a consolidation of these. It will be reviewed at the latest after six years from its adoption. The NWMP covers all types of waste generated in Denmark also including commercial waste, sewage sludge, soil waste. The only exception is nuclear/radioactive waste. The NWMP covers the entire territory and is supplemented by municipal WMPs. According to the NWMP sorting and collection of household waste must be streamlined for ten types of household waste (food, paper, cardboard, metal, glass, plastic, textile and hazardous waste as well as food and beverage cartons and residual waste). These waste streams must be collected from households and common national sorting criteria for household waste must be used to create a basis for increased recycling with higher quality. The NWMP states that the Danish government expects to meet the 2025 and 2030 packaging waste recycling targets by implementing all measures included in the plan, with the exception of plastic. To increase plastics recycling, Denmark is launching a number of initiatives such as the ban of the marketing of certain disposable plastic products; a requirement to use 25 % recycled plastic in plastic bottles in 2025 and 30 % in 2030; a requirement of a minimum of 60 % real recycling of collected plastic waste from households by 2022 (Miljøministeriet, 2020b). Packaging waste generation and treatment In Denmark, 983 000 tonnes (169kg/cap) of packaging waste were generated in 2019, which is slightly below the EU average of 178 kg/cap. Packaging waste generation has been increasing, especially plastics packaging (Figure 1.2). Paper and cardboard packaging waste generation fluctuates at the level of approximately 67 kg/cap since 2010 (Eurostat, 2022b). Figure 1.2 Packaging waste generation in Denmark between 2010 and 2019, in kg per capita Note: Data for 2010 are estimated values for all packaging waste, and in 2011 there is a break in time series for metallic and glass packaging. Values for 2011 and 2012 are flagged as estimates for metallic and glass packaging. Source: Eurostat (2022b) Capture rates for recyclables The capture rate is a good performance indicator of the effectiveness of the separate collection system. The capture rate has been calculated for this report by dividing the separately collected weight of a certain municipal waste material by the estimated weight of the total amount of material in the municipal waste. The Danish EPA has provided calculations for the residual waste composition for municipal waste. Due to an expected difference in composition for recycling stations and households/non-households residual waste, amounts of materials present in the residual waste from these two sources were calculated separately. For Denmark the separate collection capture rates are presented in Table 1.1. Table 1.1 Capture rates for different waste fractions in Denmark Residual waste compo-sition (%)(a) Residual waste composition (tonnes)(b) Residual waste composition for recycling stations (%)(c) Residual waste composition for recycling stations (tonnes)(d) Separately collected amounts (tonnes) (e) Materials in total MSW (tonnes) Capture rates (%) Mixed municipal waste, total 1 858 138 136 709 Paper and cardboard 18 343 220 18 25 252 555 614 924 086 60 Metals 2 36 341 2 2 674 166 562 205 577 81 Glass 2 28 265 2 2 080 148 420 178 765 83 Plastic 10 193 298 10 14 222 75 331 282 851 27 Garden waste 1 13 612 1 1 367 948 750 963 730 98 Food waste 44 820 921 1 1 367 115 188 937 476 12 Textiles 2 40 379 5 6 835 1 203 48 418 2 Wood n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a Source: Miljøministeriet (2022) Notes: (a) Analysis of household residual waste and source-separated organic waste, 2018, the Danish EPA (Miljø- og Fødevareministeriet, 2017). The composition is calculated based on data from the report. (b) The composition of household and non-household municipal residual waste is assumed to be the same. The amount of mixed municipal waste is from Affaldsstatistik 2019 (Miljø- og Fødevareministeriet, 2020), excl. the amount from recycling stations. (c) For residual waste from recycling stations, the same composition from household residual waste was applied except for the share of food and textile waste. The composition is an estimate. (d) Provided by the Danish EPA (e) As reported in Affaldsstatistik 2019, Miljø- og Fødevareministeriet (2020) This indicates that there is some room for improvement to capture higher amounts of the generated food waste, plastics and textiles and to some extent also of paper and cardboard. Since 2017 more municipalities have increased the number of separately collected material which is expected to affect the composition of municipal residual waste, especially for food waste (Miljøministeriet, 2022). While a capture rate for WEEE can be calculated with the same method, it delivers unreliable outcomes as there are considerable invisible flows (Miljøministeriet, 2021b) that are not captured in the data. 2 Success and risk factors likely to influence future performance 2.1 Target for preparing for reuse and recycling of municipal waste This chapter aims at assessing the prospects of Denmark to achieve the 55 % preparing for reuse and recycling target for municipal waste in 2025. For a detailed description of the methodology followed, the development of success/risk factors and their impact on recycling, please consult the methodology report (ETC/CE & ETC/WMGE, 2022). 2.1.1 Current situation and past trends SRF MSWR-1.1: Distance to target The overall recycling rate of Denmark shows a steady increase mainly driven by increasing material recycling (Figure 2.1). In this analysis the recycling rate is calculated by dividing the summed amounts of recycling of materials and of composting and digestion by the total generated amounts. The data source used is the Eurostat data set Municipal waste by waste management operations [env_wasmun] (following the OECD/Eurostat Joint Questionnaire); Data reported by Member States according to Article 10.2(a) of the Waste Framework Directive are not used for this assessment as the reporting methods differ by Member State, resulting in a lack of comparability between Member States. The data source used here is assumed to be the best available proxy, given that data in accordance with the rules on the calculation of the attainment of the targets as defined in Article 11a are not yet available. Figure 2.1 Recycling rate in Denmark between 2016 and 2020, in percentage Source: Eurostat (2022a) The actual distance to the target for the most recent data point is a key factor determining the likelihood of meeting/not meeting the target. The closer the Member State is to the target already, the more likely it becomes that the target will be met. For Denmark, the rate of municipal waste collected for recycling is 53.9 % in 2020, which is close to the 55 % target for 2025 (Miljø- og Fødevareministeriet, 2020). However, the data used for this analysis is based on a different methodology than the calculation rules for the target. The Danish government has provisionally estimated the impact of the application of the new calculation rules on the recycling rates by accounting for average loss rates per waste type. The expected impact on the recycling rate for municipal waste is that the recycling rate would drop from 52 % to 44 % for 2019 (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2020). The same 8 percentage point decrease is applied to the latest available data (2020) in this assessment to calculate the actual distance to the target. The Danish government is working on a more precise way of calculating the recycling rate according to the new rules (Miljøministeriet, 2022). Summary result Distance to target 5 - 15 percentage points Based on the currently available data, Denmark’s recycling rate was 53.9 % in 2020, 1.1 percentage points below the 2025 target. Considering however, the application of the new calculation rules, an estimated decrease of the recycling rate by 8 percentage points is assumed, leading to an approximate recycling rate of 45.9 % or 9.1 percentage points below the target. Robustness of the underlying information The new calculation rules are likely to lead to lower calculated recycling levels. Based on calculations done by the Danish authorities, the recycling rate would drop by 8 percentage points. SRF MSWR-1.2: Past trend in municipal solid waste recycling rate The recycling rate over the last five years shows a steady increase of 5.6 percentage points from 2016 to 2020, mainly driven by increasing material recycling (Figure 2.1). This indicates that efforts have to be intensified compared to progress of the past few years. Summary result RR > 45%, and increase in last 5 years < 10 percentage points The recycling rate has increased with 5.6 percentage points. For Denmark the application of the new calculation rules would result in an estimated recycling rate of 45.9 %, based on estimates done by the Danish Environmental Protection Agency that the recycling rate would decrease by 8 percentage points. The pace of improvement needs to be speeded up to obtain the target. Robustness of the underlying information There are no breaks in the time series data. For 2019 the Danish Environmental Protection Agency estimated that the recycling rate would drop by 8 percentage points if the new calculation rules would be applied, this same rate is used for 2020 in this assessment. 2.1.2 Legal instruments SRF MSWR-2.1: Timely transposition of the revised Waste Framework Directive into national law Timely transposition of the Waste Framework Directive as amended by Directive 2018/851, into national law within the foreseen period is key for a waste management system in line with EU requirements. Denmark has transposed the amended Waste Framework Directive in its Act No 807 of 9 June 2020 and Act No 645 of 19 May 2020 amending the Environmental Protection Act. Furthermore, the requirements for separate collection and waste management are transposed in Order No 2159 of 9 December 2020, which has since been repealed and replaced by Order No 2512 of 10 December 2021. Summary result Transposition without delay Denmark has transposed the amended WFD into national law by the transposition deadline. Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the European Commission (status as of 12 November 2021). SRF MSWR-2.2: Responsibilities for meeting the targets, and support and enforcement mechanisms, e.g. tools, fines etc. Clearly defined responsibilities, enforcement and support mechanisms for meeting the targets across different entities and governance levels are important for achieving high recycling rates. The clearer the responsibilities for meeting the targets and the accountability for failing the targets are, the higher the chance that the targets will be met. The Ministry of Environment is responsible for preparing the national legislation related to waste management, including setting targets for preparation for re-use, recycling, or material recovery of municipal waste, as well as stating minimum requirements for the management of waste. The Danish Climate action plan for a green waste sector and a circular economy was adopted in June 2020, which agreed to streamline the collection of municipal waste, as well as changing the framework for the waste sector so that it supports less waste incineration and more recycling. Further, it was agreed in the same Plan to reduce the incineration capacity. Capacity must be reduced and adapted to the Danish waste volumes so that the available capacity is not filled up with imported waste. In order to address plastic waste, the Plan foresees setting up a system for collecting plastic waste in the public space by January 2025 at the latest, as part of the extended producer responsibility for packaging to be introduced in Denmark. The municipalities are responsible for collecting household waste and packaging waste as a part of household waste and have to ensure proper municipal waste management. It is defined in the Danish legislation, which types of waste the municipalities are obliged to collect separately and how the municipalities are to ensure proper waste management. The municipalities have to define minimum requirements for the collection of different waste fractions (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; Miljø- og Fødevareministeriet, 2019; Miljøministeriet, 2020b). The municipalities are required to separately collect ten different types of waste using high convenience collection systems (door-to-door or, for apartment blocks, in short walking distance): food, paper, cardboard, metal, glass, plastic, textile waste as well as beverage and food cartons, residual waste and hazardous waste. This requirement is implemented in national legislation and applies from 1 July 2021. However, a majority of municipalities have been granted an extension of the deadline until end of 2022 (Miljøministeriet, 2021a); for textile waste the deadline still has to be decided but will lie between 1 July 2023 and 1 January 2025. If the municipalities offer bulky waste schemes they are also required to sort the waste after collection in order to achieve a high recycling and reuse rate. Commercial producers of waste, including of municipal waste similar to household waste, are obliged to sort their waste at source into recyclable fractions, and to make sure that the recyclable fractions are used for material recovery (Miljøministeriet, 2020b). Municipalities can decide to organise collection of residual waste from commercial waste producers or oblige them to deliver the waste to certain waste facilities (Energistyrelsen, 2021). Municipalities are obliged to control the correct management of commercial waste via inspections (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021). Measures to achieve the targets are defined in the Circular Economy Action Plan – National plan for prevention and management of waste (Handlingsplan for cirkulær økonomi – National plan for forebyggelse og håndtering af affald 2020-2032). In addition, the municipalities are required by 1 January 2022 to set requirements for minimum 60 % recycling of the collected household plastic waste in their contracts with the waste collectors. The municipalities must furthermore ensure a high recycling rate of all separately collected recyclable types of waste, however, national legislation does not set quantitative targets for recycling for the municipalities to meet. The Danish deposit and return system (DRS) for beverage packaging is responsible for collection and recycling of disposable beverage packaging, not for the handling of refillable bottles. The DRS is regulated in the Order on Deposits (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; Miljøministeriet, 2020a). The Danish EPA supports the implementation of proper waste management in Denmark via communication and cooperation with municipalities. The EPA has published guidelines for waste management, aiming to streamline and improve waste collection and ensure increasing capture rates of recyclables in Denmark for both municipal waste and packaging waste (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021). Related to enforcement mechanisms, the National Board of Appeal is the supervising authority for the municipalities, supervising the compliance with national law. In the case of non-compliance, the Board can assign daily fines to the members of the municipal council as enforcement mechanism. (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021) Summary result Clearly defined responsibilities, enforcement and good set of support mechanisms for meeting the recycling targets Denmark reports clearly defined responsibilities, as well as clearly defined enforcement mechanisms for meeting the targets on recycling of municipal waste, in addition Denmark also presents support mechanisms to improve the implementation of the responsible entities. Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the Danish authorities through the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire 2.1.3 Economic instruments SRF MSW-3.1: Taxes and/or ban for landfilling residual- or biodegradable waste Bans and taxes on landfilling of residual municipal waste can help to discourage strong reliance on residual waste treatment and thus support recycling. Denmark has a landfill tax in place since 1987 of 475 DKK/t (about 63.3 EUR/t) before VAT (about 79 EUR/t VAT incl.). Since 1997, there is also a landfill ban on recyclable and combustible waste (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; Skatteministeriet, 2020). Summary result Ban in place for landfilling residual or biodegradable waste Denmark has a landfill ban, and a landfill tax of 79 EUR/t (corresponding to 56 EUR/t rescaled based on purchasing power parities(a)) Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the Danish authorities through the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire. (a) Note: Rescaled based on purchasing power parities Eurostat (2020a) SRF MSWR-3.2: Taxes on municipal waste incineration Taxes on incineration of residual municipal waste can help to discourage strong reliance on residual waste treatment and thus support recycling. Denmark has taxes on waste incineration via three different elements (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; SKAT (Danish Tax Authority), 2022; Miljøministeriet, 2022): • An incineration tax since 1999 that totals 52.5 DKK/GJ in 2022, consisting of: o A tax on heat generated from waste incineration (20.7 DKK/GJ), which is indexed annually with the net price index o An additional incineration tax (31.8 DKK/GJ), which is not indexed. • A CO2-tax since 2010 which is levied on incinerated non-biodegradable waste (179.2 DKK/tonne of CO2 emitted), which is indexed annually with the net price index. Due to the different tax bases for the three taxation elements, the taxes cannot easily be translated into a tax per tonne of waste. If an energy content of 10.6 GJ/tonne is assumed (Danish Ministry of the Environment, 2013), the incineration tax alone would be around 557 DKK/tonne, corresponding to 75 EUR/t. Summary result Taxes > 18 EUR/t(a) If an energy content of 10.6 GJ/tonne is assumed, the incineration tax alone would be about 75 EUR/t (corresponding to 53 EUR/t rescaled based on purchasing power parities). Furthermore, a CO2-tax is levied on incinerated non-biodegradable waste. Robustness of the underlying information The underlying information provided by the Danish authorities can be considered robust. The calculation of the total incineration tax rate is based on assumptions. (a) Note: Rescaled based on purchasing power parities Eurostat (2020a) SRF MSWR-3.3: Pay-as-you-throw (PAYT) system in place PAYT systems are designed to incentivize citizens to make a bigger effort in separating their waste at source. However, a PAYT system should be designed with the appropriate level of source separation encouragement to ensure that citizens do not misplace waste in recycling bins in order to avoid residual waste charges. Overall, PAYT usually has a positive effect on source separation and thus recycling rates through direct involvement of citizens. Denmark has a policy of full cost recovery for municipal waste collection which allows for the possibility of PAYT-schemes. As a principle, the fees for municipal waste management shall cover all costs related to the service. It is not allowed to cover cost for the service of collecting recyclables through the residual waste fee. The legal framework permits the use of PAYT by municipalities. Municipalities still often charge a flat rate for collection of both recyclables and residual waste, with some municipalities granting citizens a choice of the size of container, the larger container having a higher fee (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; Klima-, Energi- og Forsyningsministeriet, 2020). Recent information about the shares of the different systems is not available. A survey of Danish municipalities performed in 2015 indicated that container volume based fees and fees based on a combination of factors were dominant while there was very little use of weight based systems (Deloitte and Incentive, 2015). Summary result PAYT scheme implemented in some regions/ municipalities (50-80% of population covered) Denmark has a policy for municipal waste collection which allows for the possibility of PAYT-schemes but municipalities often do not implement PAYT. Robustness of the underlying information It is unclear how strong the economic incentive is for citizens to place waste in the bins for recyclables instead of in the bin for residual waste. Recent information about the shares of the different systems (volume based, frequency of collection, weight based) is not available. 2.1.4 Separate collection system SRF MSWR-4.1: Convenience and coverage of separate collection systems for the different household waste fractions Separate collection systems are a key enabler for high recycling rates and for collecting recyclables at adequate quality. Generally, the more convenient and accessible these systems are for their users, the better results they deliver. The assessment methodology categorises different types of collection systems (door-to-door, bring points with a density of > 5 per km2, bring points with a density of < 5 per km2, civic amenity site) for assessing the degree of convenience, and differentiates between cities (densely populated), towns and suburbs (intermediate densely populated) and rural (thinly populated areas). It then calculates which share of the population is served by which type of system. The assessment is done on a material basis and takes into account the different materials according to their average share in municipal waste. This is described in more detail in the methodology (ETC/CE & ETC/WMGE, 2022) For Denmark, according to the most recent data, the percentage of households living in cities is 32 %, in towns and suburbs 35 % and in rural areas 33 % (Eurostat, 2021a). In Denmark, there have been a large number of different waste sorting and collection schemes across the municipalities, resulting in a high variance in the collection schemes between municipalities. This changed in July 2021 with the implementation of the Climate action plan for a green waste sector and a circular economy (see next section), however, the majority of Danish municipalities have been granted an extension of the deadline to fully implement the new requirements until end of 2022. The use of co-mingled collection has been increasing (Eurostat, 2020b). The separate collection of food waste is today not covered by all municipalities (56 %) (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021). The municipalities are required to separately collect ten different types of waste through high convenience collection systems: food, paper, cardboard, metal, glass, plastic, textile waste as well as beverage and food cartons, residual waste and hazardous waste. The collection should be door-to-door if possible, with respect to the types of buildings/housing area. Depending on the type of areas a bring point can be used, that is located so it can be reached by foot. Thus, the type of schemes used will change over the next two years – since the deadline has been postponed for a number of municipalities. Both households and companies are obliged to sort their waste for separate collection. Municipalities can decide if companies can use the collection system organised by the municipality or if they should organise collection themselves or through contractors. However, municipalities are responsible for the inspection of commercial waste management (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; Miljøministeriet, 2020c). Table 2.1 gives an overview of the collection system in Denmark. The collection in Demark is material based and the collection systems do not distinguish between packaging and non-packaging waste. The Danish EPA publishes data about municipalities’ implementation of the requirements to collect ten different fractions separately (Miljøministeriet, 2021c). Table 2.1 Characterisation of the collection system in Denmark Cities (densely populated areas) Towns and suburbs (intermediate density areas) Rural areas (thinly populated areas) Door-to-door - separate Door-to-door - co-mingled Bring point (>5 per km²) Bring point (<5 per km²) Civic amenity site Door-to-door - separate Door-to-door - co-mingled Bring point (>5 per km²) Bring point (<5 per km²) Civic amenity site Door-to-door - separate Door-to-door - co-mingled Bring point Civic amenity site Residual waste xx x xx x xx x Paper and Cardboard xx x xx x x xx x xx x x xx x xx x Ferrous metals x x x x x x x x x x x Aluminium x x x x x x x x x x x Glass x x x x x x x X x x x x x x Plastic x x x x x x x x x x x Bio-waste food x x x x x x garden x x x x x x x x Textiles x (few) x x x x (few) x x x x (few) x x Wood x x x x x x x x x WEEE x x x x x x x x Composite packaging x(a) (few) x(a) (few) X(a) (few) Other: Hazardous waste x x (with WEEE) x x x x x (with WEEE) x x x x x (with WEEE) x x Note: xx: dominant system; x: other significant systems. Grey cells indicate high convenience collection systems. (a) Primo 2022, about 1.25 million people (23 % of the population) covered by separate collection of food and drink cartons Source: Danish Environmental Protection Agency (2021), Miljøministeriet (2021c) Taking this into account, Denmark uses a range of options for separate collection, with different services offered in different municipalities. Summary result Paper and cardboard A high share of the population is covered by high convenience collection services For paper and cardboard waste, different types of separate collection systems are used by the Danish municipalities but door-to-door separate collection and high-density bring points dominate. Metals A high share of the population is covered by high convenience collection services For metals waste, a large range of different types of separate collection systems are used by the Danish municipalities, except low-density bring points in urban areas and civic amenity sites in rural areas. Plastics A high share of the population is covered by high convenience collection services For plastic waste, a large range of different types of separate collection systems are used by the Danish municipalities, except low-density bring points in urban areas and civic amenity sites in rural areas. Glass A high share of the population is covered by high convenience collection services Denmark conducts all separate collection alternatives for the collection of glass waste. More than 70 % of the municipalities collect glass waste either by door-to-door collection or high-convenience bring points. Bio-waste A medium share of the population is covered by high convenience collection services Denmark conducts door-to-door and high density bring point collection for food and garden waste, but not yet in all municipalities. Garden waste is additionally collected at civic amenity sites. Improvements are expected by the end of 2022. Wood A high share of the population is covered by high convenience collection services Denmark conducts door-to-door and high density bring point collection for wood waste. This collection mainly refers to picking up bulky waste from households. Wood waste is additionally collected at civic amenity sites. Textiles A low share of the population is covered by high convenience collection services Denmark conducts bring point and civic amenity site collection with a small addition of co-mingled collection for textile waste. Reusable textiles are also collected by charities. WEEE High to medium convenience collection services dominate Denmark conducts door-to-door and high-density bring point collection for WEEE and additionally civic amenity site collection in urban areas. Many municipalities have introduced collection schemes for battery waste and small electronic waste, e.g. so that it is collected together with hazardous waste. Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the Danish authorities through the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire. Danish municipalities apply different types of separate collection systems for the different materials. However, no quantitative information is available for the coverage of each system. This means that the population coverages in this table are rough estimates. SRF MSWR-4.2: Firm plans to improve the convenience and coverage of separate collection for the different household waste fractions In the waste Law it is stated , that as of July 2021, with the option to apply for a derogation until 31 December 2022, all municipalities are obliged to arrange high convenience separate collection schemes for the following waste fractions (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; Miljøministeriet, 2020b): residual waste, paper, cardboard, metal, glass, plastic, food waste, textiles (between mid-2023 and 1 January 2025), composite packaging (food- and drink cartons) and hazardous waste. The municipalities can choose between door-to-door-separate collection or door-to-door-co-mingled collection (for certain combinations of materials). For glass as well as for all fractions in densely populated areas and from holiday cottages a bring point system in walking distance from the house is accepted. For the following fractions co-mingled collection will be allowed (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; Miljøministeriet, 2020d): paper/cardboard, metal/plastic, plastic/ composite packaging, metal/plastic/composite packaging and metal/glass. Today, reusable textiles are collected via charity organisations. The separate collection scheme for textile waste will be limited to textiles waste not suitable for reuse (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021). Together with the national harmonisation of the separate collection system, a harmonised pictogram and colour scheme is rolled out in order to improve the citizen’s understanding of the waste collection system across the country. It has been developed by the Danish Environmental Protection Agency, the Association of municipalities and the Danish Waste Association and is used or underway to be used by nearly all Danish municipalities (Danish Waste Association, 2021). As of 2023, non-household waste generators are obliged to sort their waste for separate collection similar to household waste for the same fractions as households with the same options regarding co-mingled fractions (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; Miljøministeriet, 2020c). It is important to note that non-household waste generators already are obliged to sort their waste and ensure proper waste management. But from 2023 they are obliged to sort municipal waste in the same way and use the same pictograms on the collection containers as municipalities shall for collection containers for household waste. Non-household waste generators are allowed to sort in more detailed fractions if it is suitable with regard to the specific waste generated. Summary result Paper and cardboard Firm plans to improve the separate collection system, with clear responsible entities and defined targets and timeline.

Textiles Firm plans to improve the separate collection system, with clear responsible entities and defined targets and timeline. Between 2023 and 2025, it will be required that all municipalities in Denmark are obliged to arrange separate collection schemes (door-to-door or high convenience bring points) WEEE N/A (for countries already covering > 80% of the population by high convenience collection services) No changes planned. Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the Danish authorities through the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire. The obligations for municipalities are set in the Danish legislation and explained in recommendations issued by the Danish EPA. 2.1.5 Extended producer responsibility (EPR) and similar schemes SRF MSWR-5.1: Fee modulation in EPR schemes for packaging Within EPR schemes, fee modulation (or eco-modulation) is a system with different fees for different types of packaging material and designs. While basic fee modulation, i.e. different fees for the main material groups, are common, advanced fee modulation can create stronger incentives for packaging producers to design for recycling and thus create favourable conditions for higher recycling rates. The level of advancement of the fee modulation is assessed against four criteria that have been selected as benchmarks for a well-designed eco-modulated fee system: • recyclability, for example differentiating between PET and PS, between different colours of PET, or between 100 % cardboard boxes and laminated beverage cartons; • sortability and disruptors, for example a malus for labels/caps/sleeves made of other materials, which are not fitted for the recycling technologies of the main packaging; • recycled content; and • if there is a transparent compliance check by the Producer Responsibility Organisation (PRO) that producers report correctly. Denmark has no general EPR scheme for packaging yet, instead Denmark has a comprehensive deposit return system for beverage packaging, also aiming at preventing free riding in relation to beverage packaging. The deposit return system is planned to continue and to operate in parallel with a new general EPR scheme for all other packaging, which is not covered by the deposit return system. The implementation process for setting up a general EPR scheme has started. A law that establishes the legal basis for a general EPR system for packaging in Denmark was passed by the Danish Government in June 2020. In March 2022, the organisation and administrative setup for the EPR system is still under discussion with political parties (Miljøministeriet, 2022). The EPR scheme for packaging will be introduced no later than 31 December 2024 and will include all types of packaging in all types of materials. While no EPR system and thus no fee modulation within EPR is currently in place for packaging, the Danish deposit return system (Dansk Retursystem) requires producers and importers of bottled and canned beverages to pay a quarterly fee for marketing beverages on which deposits are payable. The fees vary for each type of bottle or can, depending on the volume of the bottle or can and their recyclability. The fees are calculated each year based on the expenditure of Dansk Retursystem versus the income. The fees are required to solely reflect the exact costs of operating and administering an efficient deposit and return system (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021). Summary result No EPR scheme and no advanced fee modulation Denmark has no EPR scheme for packaging yet. Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the Danish authorities through the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire. 2.1.6 Treatment capacity for bio-waste SRF MSWR-6.1: Capacity for the treatment of bio-waste Bio-waste is the largest single waste material fraction in municipal waste, and adequate treatment capacity needs to be made available. As reported by the Danish authorities, the country’s separately collected bio-waste amounted to 1 336 000 tonnes in 2019, comprising of 353 000 tonnes of food waste collected from households, restaurants, catering, retail and food industry, and 983 000 tonnes of garden waste. 93 % of garden waste from households was collected for recycling (Miljø- og Fødevareministeriet, 2020). In 2019 882 000 tonnes municipal waste was collected for composting and digestion (Eurostat, 2021b). The Danish authorities estimate, based on current knowledge, that 75 % of garden waste collected for recycling undergoes recycling treatment, if accounting for average loss rates per waste type according to the new calculation rules. For food waste the estimate is 85 %. The Danish authorities do not report a specific available capacity for the treatment of bio-waste. The total generation of bio-waste within total municipal waste, including separately collected bio-waste and bio-waste present in the residual waste fraction, is estimated at 1 901 206 tonnes in 2017 (this is the sum of food waste and garden waste) (Table 1.1). As of July 2021 and by end of 2022 at the latest, all households should have collection of food waste, and from 31 December 2023 the municipalities are required to establish a separate collection scheme for garden waste from households. Bio-waste treatment will be privately organised and municipalities must tender the treatment of bio-waste. Municipalities unable to cover the capacity demand from the private sector may be granted exemption from the legal requirement to tender the treatment of bio-waste and allowed to arrange for treatment capacity themselves (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; Government of Denmark, 2020). Based on a survey of treatment installations and a calculation on the potential of food waste in Denmark, the Waste and Resource Network Denmark (DAKOFA, 2021) estimates that the current capacity for anaerobic digestion of food waste covers 72-87 % of the food waste potential (related to both food waste from households and the service sector). Based on the presented information, it is likely that the currently available capacity for the treatment of bio-waste is slightly below 80 % of the generated bio-waste, however, the municipalities have a clear mandate to either tender or create the additional capacity needed to close any capacity gap. Summary result Bio-waste capacity below 80% of generated municipal bio-waste but firm plans to close the gap The Danish authorities report that the required additional capacity demand for the treatment of bio-waste will be covered by the private sector or the municipalities. Robustness of the underlying information The information regarding available capacities is limited, and information is lacking on how the future capacity building will be implemented in practice. SRF MSWR-6.2: Legally binding national standards and Quality Management System for compost/digestate To create a market for compost and digestate, compost should be of a good quality for use as a soil improver or fertilizer. Legally binding standards provide guarantees regarding the quality of the compost/digestate produced. A quality management system aims at addressing different elements of a production process to ensure a stable and high-quality output (product) which helps toward reaching a defined quality for the product. Denmark has national standards for compost quality (EEA, 2020; Miljø- og Fødevareministeriet, 2018, 2008). Before the composting and/or biogas process, the bio-waste needs to comply with the limit values laid down in statutory order no. 1001 of the 27 June 2018 regarding the use of waste for agricultural purposes (Miljøministeriet, 2022). The Danish Agricultural Agency is in the process of implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1009 of the 5 June 2019 regarding laying down rules on the making available on the market of EU fertilising products. This regulation includes quality management systems and standards for compost quality (Miljøministeriet, 2022). Summary result Legally binding national standards for compost/digestate quality but no quality management system Denmark has legally binding national standards for compost quality. The bio- waste needs to comply with certain limit values before being used in a composting and/or biogas process. Robustness of the underlying information The information is based on legal standards. 2.2 Target for the recycling of packaging waste This chapter aims at assessing the prospects of Denmark to achieve the 65 % recycling target for packaging waste in 2025 as well as the material specific packaging waste recycling targets (50 % of plastic; 25 % of wood; 70 % of ferrous metals; 50 % of aluminium; 70 % of glass; 75 % of paper and cardboard). In order to conclude on this likelihood, the analysis takes stock of the status of several factors that are proven to influence the levels of recycling in a country. For a detailed description of the methodology followed, the development of success/risk factors and their impact on recycling, please consult the methodology report (ETC/CE & ETC/WMGE, 2022). 2.2.1 Current situation and past trends SRF P-1.1 Distance to target The actual distance to the target for the most recent data point is a key factor determining the likelihood of meeting or not meeting the target. This analysis is based on data reported by Denmark to Eurostat in accordance with Commission Decision 2005/270/EC as last amended by the Commission Implementing Decision 2019/665 (EC, 2019), published in the dataset Recycling rates of packaging waste for monitoring compliance with policy targets, by type of packaging [env_waspacr]. The latest available data refers to 2019. The performance of Denmark for 2019 is illustrated in Figure 2.2. Figure 2.2 Packaging recycling rates for Denmark in 2019, in percentage Note: No data available for ferrous and aluminium packaging, only for metallic packaging. Source: Eurostat (2022c), EU (2018) For Denmark the reported recycling rates exceed the targets for all packaging materials except of plastics packaging. For total packaging, the recycling exceeds the target by 5.4 percentage points, for paper and cardboard packaging by 22.7 percentage points, for glass by 1.1 percentage points, and for wooden packaging by 32.4 percentage points. For metals, the reported rates do not make a distinction between ferrous metals and aluminium, but the total recycling rate for metals (61.3 %) still exceeds the recycling target for aluminium, but not for ferrous metals. For plastics packaging, the reported recycling rate is 12.6 percentage points below the target (Eurostat, 2022c). However, the recycling rates presented are based on the calculation rules of the Commission Decision 2005/270 before it was amended by the Commission Implementing Decision 2019/665 and will likely differ from the recycling rates to be reported according to the new calculation rules. The new calculation rules will only be mandatory to be used for the reference year 2020 and onwards. A key difference in the new calculation rules compared to the old rules is that the amount of sorted packaging waste that is rejected by the recycling facility shall not be included in the reported amount of recycled packaging waste. Denmark has carried out a preliminary assessment of the impact of the new calculation rules. Currently, the reported data refer to packaging waste collected for recycling and the final recycling rate will refer to the output of recycling. The Danish government has estimated final recycling rates for the year 2018 by accounting for average loss rates per waste type (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021). If the same reduction in the rates (in percentage points) are used to calculate the impact of the new calculation rules to the reported data for the year 2019, the recycling rates would decrease as follows: • Paper and cardboard packaging waste by 3 per cent points from 99.7 % to 96.7 % • Metal packaging waste by 10 per cent points from 61.3 % to 51.3 % • Glass packaging waste by 3 per cent points from 71.1 % to 68.1 % • Plastic packaging waste by 17 per cent points from 37.4 % to 20.4 % • Wood packaging waste by 4 per cent points from 57.4 % to 53.4 % • Total packaging: Calculated based on the amounts of each packaging material generated and recycled in 2019, the recycling rate would drop from 70.4 % to 64.1 %. The waste generation data includes also privately imported packaging, and for plastics and paper/cardboard also estimates for online sales (Eurostat, 2020b). It is likely that the currently reported recycling rate of 99.7 % is overestimated for paper and cardboard packaging. The latest Danish composition analysis of mixed household waste (Miljøstyrelsen, 2018) found that 3.1 % of this waste was cardboard, corresponding to around 31 000 tonnes in 2017 (the same study reports the amount of mixed household waste to be 995 000 tonnes). If it is assumed that most of this cardboard is packaging, around 8 % of the generated paper and cardboard packaging would end up in mixed municipal waste. This estimate does not take into account municipal waste from non-households and paper packaging. Summary result Total packaging < 5 percentage points below target Denmark reports a recycling rate of 70.4 %. If the estimated loss rate provided by Denmark is applied (taking into account losses in the recycling plants), the estimated recycling rate would drop to 64.1 %, 0.9 percentage points below the 2025 target. Paper and cardboard packaging Target exceeded Denmark reports a recycling rate of 99.7 %. If the estimated loss rate provided by Denmark is applied (taking into account losses in the recycling plants), the estimated recycling rate would drop to 96.7 %, 21.7 percentage points above the 2025 target. Ferrous metals packaging > 15 percentage points below target Denmark reports a recycling rate of 61.3 % for total metals packaging. If the estimated loss rate provided by Denmark is applied (taking into account losses in the recycling plants), the estimated recycling rate would drop to 51.3 %, 18.7 percentage points below the target for steel and 1.3 percentage points above the target for aluminium. Aluminium packaging Target exceeded Glass packaging < 5 percentage points below targe Denmark reports a recycling rate of 71.1 %. If the estimated loss rate provided by Denmark is applied (taking into account losses in the recycling plants), the estimated recycling rate would drop to 68.1%, 1.9 percentage points below the 2025 target. Plastics packaging > 15 percentage points below target Denmark reports a recycling rate of 37.4 %. If the estimated loss rate provided by Denmark is applied (taking into account losses in the recycling plants), the estimated recycling rate would drop to 20.4 %, 29.6 percentage points below the 2025 target. Wooden packaging Target exceeded Denmark reports a recycling rate of 57.4 %. If the estimated loss rate provided by Denmark is applied (taking into account losses in the recycling plants), the estimated recycling rate would drop to 53.4 %, 28.4 percentage points above the 2025 target. Robustness of the underlying information The recycling rates used for the assessment referring to 2019 data are estimated, by applying the same reduction (in percentage points) as calculated by the Danish authorities for losses during sorting and recycling for the 2018 data in order to assess the impact of the new calculation rules on the currently reported recycling rates. Separate data for aluminium and ferrous metals packaging are not yet available. The 99.7 % recycling rate for paper and cardboard packaging is very high, indicating that not all generated paper and cardboard waste may be included in the waste generation data. Danish authorities indicate that the methodology for the data on amounts put on the market underestimates the amounts for paper and cardboard and overestimates the amounts for plastics packaging. SRF P-1.2: Past trend in Packaging Waste Recycling The development of the historical trend in the recycling rate indicates previous efforts towards packaging waste recycling. In this analysis the recycling rate reported in the Eurostat dataset Recycling rates of packaging waste for monitoring compliance with policy targets, by type of packaging [env_waspacr] (latest data year: 2019) is used. The recycling trends for packaging waste by material in Denmark are illustrated in Figure 2.3. Figure 2.3 Trend in packaging waste recycling rates in Denmark between 2015 and 2019, in percentage Source: Eurostat (2022c) The overall packaging recycling rate for the past five years started at 73.9 % in 2015, peaked at 79 % in 2016 and dropped to 70.4 % in 2019. The recycling rate of paper and cardboard packaging increased from 95.3 % in 2015 to 99.7 % in 2019. Plastic packaging increased from 30.5 % in 2015 to 37.4 % in 2019, while it peaked in 2017 at 41.8 %. The recycling rate of wooden packaging has plummeted; starting at 75.9 % in 2015 and peaking at 87.3 % in 2016, the recycling rate was 57.4% in 2019. The strong rise and drop in recycling of wooden packaging is influenced by the supply of and replacement of re-used wooden pallets and recycling activities may not take place the same year as waste generation (Eurostat, 2020b). The recycling rate of metallic packaging showed a decrease of 10.6 percentage points during the five years, and for glass packaging a decrease with 8.4 percentage points. (Eurostat, 2022c) The Danish calculation methodology for packaging waste generation is to be updated (Eurostat, 2020b), which may improve the data also on recycling rates. Summary result Total packaging RR > 60% and increase in last 5 years < 5 percentage points The recycling rate decreased by 3.5 percentage points over the past five years, and is estimated to be 64.1 % in 2019 applying the estimated loss rate provided by Denmark. Paper and cardboard packaging RR > 75% The recycling rate increased by 4.4 percentage points over the past five years, and is estimated to be 96.7 % in 2019 applying the estimated loss rate provided by Denmark. Ferrous metals packaging RR < 60% and increase in last 5 years < 10 percentage points The recycling rate decreased by 10.6 percentage points over the past five years, and is estimated to be 51.3 % in 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Percentage Packaging Paper and cardboard packaging Plastic packaging Wooden packaging Metallic packaging Glass packaging Aluminium packaging RR > 50% 2019 applying the estimated loss rate provided by Denmark. Glass packaging RR > 65% and increase in last 5 years < 5 percentage points The recycling rate decreased by 8.4 percentage points over the past five years, and is estimated to be 68.1 % in 2019 applying the estimated loss rate provided by Denmark. Plastics packaging RR < 40% and increase in last 5 years < 10 percentage points The recycling rate increased by 6.9 percentage points over the past five years, and is estimated to be 20.4 % in 2019 applying the estimated loss rate provided by Denmark. Wooden packaging RR > 25% The recycling rate decreased by 18.5 percentage points over the past five years, and is estimated to be 53.4 % in 2019 applying the estimated loss rate provided by Denmark. Robustness of the underlying information There are no breaks in the time series for 2015-2019 indicated in the dataset. The estimated recycling rates used for the assessment referring to 2019 data are estimated by applying the same reduction (in percentage points) as calculated by the Danish authorities for losses during sorting and recycling for the 2018 data in order to assess the impact of the new calculation rules on the currently reported recycling rates. Separate data for aluminium and ferrous metals packaging are not yet available. 2.2.2 Legal instruments SRF P-2.1: Timely transposition of the revised Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive into national law Timely transposition of the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive as amended by Directive 2018/852, into national law within the foreseen period is key for a waste management system in line with EU requirements. Summary result Transposition without delay Denmark has transposed the amended Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive into national law by the transposition deadline. Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the European Commission (status as of 12 November 2021). SRF P-2.2: Responsibilities for meeting the targets, and enforcement mechanisms, e.g. fines etc. As described in Section 2.1.2, the current responsibilities, enforcement mechanisms and support tools for meeting the targets are well defined. Packaging waste is under the same administration as municipal waste. However, the implementation process for setting up a general EPR scheme has started (see Section 2.1.5), with the aim to transfer the responsibility for packaging recycling to the producers. The EPR scheme for packaging will be introduced no later than 31 December 2024 and will include all types of packaging in all types of materials. Decisions about the organisation and administrative setup for the EPR system have not yet been made and thus forthcoming responsibilities for meeting the packaging waste targets in Denmark are not fully defined. Summary result Unclear responsibilities, weak/no enforcement mechanisms and lack of support tools for meeting the recycling targets Denmark has planned to implement an EPR scheme for packaging waste by the end of 2024, but the configuration of the scheme, enforcement and support mechanisms are not yet defined. Robustness of the underlying information Reliable information provided by the Danish authorities in the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire. The implementation process for setting up an EPR scheme for packaging in Denmark has started but decisions about the organisation and administrative setup for the EPR system have not yet been made and thus forthcoming responsibilities are not fully defined. 2.2.3 Economic instruments SRF P-3.1: Taxes and/or ban for landfilling residual- or biodegradable waste Bans and taxes on landfilling of residual waste can help to discourage landfilling and thus support recycling, also of packaging waste. As described in Section 2.1.3 in more detail, Denmark has a landfill tax and a landfill ban in place. Summary result Ban in place for landfilling residual or biodegradable waste Denmark has a landfill ban in place Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the Danish authorities through the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire. SRF P-3.2: Taxes on municipal waste incineration Taxes on incineration of residual waste can help to discourage strong reliance on residual waste treatment and thus support recycling. As described in Section 2.1.3 in more detail, Denmark has an incineration tax in place annually adjusted by the net price index. Summary result Taxes > 18 EUR/t(a) If an energy content of 10.6 GJ/tonne is assumed, the incineration tax alone would be about 75 EUR/t (corresponding to 53 EUR/t rescaled based on purchasing power parities). Furthermore, a CO2-tax is levied on incinerated of non-biodegradable waste. Robustness of the underlying information The underlying information provided by the Danish authorities can be considered robust. The calculation of the total incineration tax rate is based on assumptions. (a) Note: Rescaled based on purchasing power parities Eurostat (2020a) SRF P-3.3: Packaging taxes Packaging taxes can support the aim to reduce packaging waste generation and/or to influence the choice of packaging materials and encourage recyclability and eco-design. According to the information available, Denmark implements packaging taxes with an escalator (taxes on packaging, bags and disposable tableware are indexed with 5.5 % in 2024), as presented in Table 2.2. The packaging taxes focus on beverage packaging (excl. dairy), PVC films for food, bags and disposable tableware. Packaging that is included in the deposit return scheme is exempted from the packaging taxes. Table 2.2 Packaging taxes in Denmark in 2021; DKK per kg and DKK per item.

Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the Danish authorities through the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire. SRF P-3.4: Pay-as-you-throw (PAYT) system in place As a large share of packaging waste is generated in households, incentivising households to separate packaging waste at source, e.g. by applying PAYT systems, is relevant for meeting the recycling targets for packaging waste. As described in Section 2.1.3 in more detail, Denmark has a policy for municipal waste collection which allows for the possibility of PAYT-schemes but municipalities often do not implement PAYT. Summary result PAYT scheme implemented in some regions/ municipalities (50-80% of population covered) Denmark has a policy for municipal waste collection which allows for the possibility of PAYT-schemes but municipalities often do not implement PAYT Robustness of the underlying information It is unclear how strong the economic incentive is for citizens to place waste in the bins for recyclables instead of in the bin for residual waste. Recent information about the shares of the different systems (volume based, frequency of collection, weight based) is not available. SRF P-3.5: Deposit return systems Deposit Return Systems (DRS) generate high capture rates for packaging covered by the system and thus contribute to increased recycling rates. The Danish Deposit and return scheme is regulated in the Statutory Order on Deposits. Dansk Retursystem A/S runs the deposit and return scheme in Denmark. Requirements on the targeted return percentage is agreed between the Danish Ministry of Environment and DRS. The Danish DRS covers the following packaging (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; Miljøministeriet, 2020a): • Beer; • Carbonated beverages (such as soft drinks with an alcohol content of 0–0.5 %); • Other fermented drink products (such as cider with an alcohol content of less than 10 %); • Mixer products in which spirits, wine or other fermented products are mixed with other beverages such as soft drinks, cider or juice (such as alcoholic soft drinks with alcohol content exceeding 0.5 % but not exceeding 10 %); • Mineral water, water, lemonade, iced tea and similar products that are non-carbonated and ready to drink; • Concentrated cordial intended to be diluted before it is consumed; • Pure juice of fruits and vegetables; • Smoothies (without milk). Summary result Aluminium drink cans Mandatory DRS for nearly all drink cans The mandatory system covers nearly all drink cans (see above list) Glass drink bottles Mandatory DRS for nearly all drink bottles The mandatory system covers nearly all drink glass bottles (see above list) Plastic drink bottles Mandatory DRS for nearly all drink bottles The mandatory system covers nearly all plastic bottles (see above list) Plastic crates Voluntary DRS for some specific plastic crates The voluntary system covers some specific plastic crates for beers and sodas Wooden packaging No DRS for wooden packaging Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the Danish authorities through the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire. 2.2.4 Separate collection system SRF P-4.1: Convenience and coverage of separate collection for different packaging waste fractions As a large part of packaging waste comes from households, separate collection systems for households and similar sources are a key condition for high recycling rates for packaging waste and for collecting recyclables at adequate quality. Such systems generally deliver better results the more convenient and accessible they are for their users, also compared to the collection of residual waste. The material specific assessment considers packaging waste from both household and non-household sources. For assessing the convenience and coverage of separate collection systems for households, the same methodology is used here as described in section 2.1.4. As described in Section 2.1.4 in more detail, separate collection is mandatory in Denmark for both households and companies (non-households). Summary result Paper and cardboard packaging 1. Packaging waste from households A high share of the population is covered by high convenience collection services Danish municipalities apply different separate collection schemes for the collection of paper and cardboard waste, but door-to-door separate collection and high-density bring points dominate. 2. Packaging waste from non-household sources Separation at source is mandatory for non-household paper and cardboard packaging waste Separation at source is mandatory in Denmark for companies Ferrous metals packaging 1. Packaging waste from households A high share of population is covered by high convenience collection services Denmark applies all separate collection alternatives for the collection of metals, except low-density bring points in urban areas and civic amenity sites in rural areas. 2. Packaging waste from non-household sources Separation at source is mandatory for non-household ferrous metals packaging waste Separation at source is mandatory in Denmark for companies Aluminium packaging Packaging waste from households A high share of population is covered by high convenience collection services Denmark applies all separate collection alternatives for the collection of metals, except low-density bring points in urban areas and civic amenity sites in rural areas. Plastics packaging 1. Packaging waste from households A high share of population is covered by high convenience collection services Denmark applies all separate collection alternatives for the collection of plastics, except low-density bring points in urban areas and civic amenity sites in rural areas. 2. Packaging waste from non-household sources Separation at source is mandatory for non-household plastic packaging waste Separation at source is mandatory in Denmark for companies Glass packaging 1. Packaging waste from households A high share of the population is covered by high convenience collection services Denmark applies all separate collection alternatives for the collection of glass waste. More than 70 % of the municipalities either have door-to-door collection services or collect glass in cubes within walking distance of the household. 2. Packaging waste from non-household sources Separation at source is mandatory for non-household glass packaging waste Separation at source is mandatory in Denmark for companies Wooden packaging Packaging waste from non-household sources Separation at source is mandatory for non-household wooden packaging waste Separation at source is mandatory in Denmark for companies Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the Danish authorities through the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire. Quantitative information on the shares of the population covered by the different systems is not available. Note: The main source for aluminium packaging waste is drink cans from households, therefore the assessment does not consider aluminium non-household waste. SRF P-4.2: Firm plans to improve the convenience of separate collection for the different packaging waste fractions Concrete plans are needed to improve the convenience and coverage of separate collection. This SRF is only relevant for MS and materials that do not score ‘green’ in SRF P-4.1. The assessment is done on a material basis, and summing up the scores of the different materials according to their average share in packaging waste1. Again, the material specific assessment considers packaging waste from both household and non-household sources. As described in Section 2.1.4 in more detail, as of July 2021 all municipalities in Denmark are obliged to arrange unified separate collection schemes. The collection should be door-to-door if possible with respect to the types of buildings/housing area. Depending on the population density, also high-density bring points can be used. 1 Based on data from Eurostat on the share of packaging materials in total packaging generated in 2018 Summary result Paper and cardboard packaging 1. Packaging waste from households Firm plans to improve the separate collection system, with clear responsible entities and defined targets and timeline. By end of 2022 at the latest, all municipalities in Denmark are obliged to arrange separate collection schemes with a high service level. 2. Packaging waste from non-household sources N/A (for countries already implementing mandatory sorting at source for non-household ferrous metals packaging waste) Ferrous metals packaging 1. Packaging waste from households Firm plans to improve the separate collection system, with clear responsible entities and defined targets and timeline. By end of 2022 at the latest, all municipalities in Denmark are obliged to arrange separate collection schemes with a high service level. 2. Packaging waste from non-household sources N/A (for countries already implementing mandatory sorting at source for non-household paper and cardboard packaging waste) Aluminium packaging Packaging waste from household sources N/A (for countries already covering > 80% of the population by high convenience points) Glass packaging 1.

Packaging waste from households Firm plans to improve the separate collection system, with clear responsible entities and defined targets and timeline. By end of 2022 at the latest, all municipalities in Denmark are obliged to arrange separate collection schemes with a high service level. 2. Packaging waste from non-household sources N/A (for countries already implementing mandatory sorting at source for non-household plastic packaging waste) Wooden packaging Packaging waste from non-household sources N/A (for countries already implementing mandatory sorting at source for non-household wooden packaging waste) Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the Danish authorities through the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire. 2.2.5 Extended producer responsibility (EPR) and similar schemes SRF P-5.1: Coverage of EPR schemes As described in Section 2.1.5 in more detail, Denmark has no general EPR schemes for packaging yet but only a deposit-return system for beverage packaging as described in section 2.1.5. Summary result Not all main packaging fractions(a) are covered by EPR schemes Denmark has no EPR scheme for all packaging yet. Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the Danish authorities through the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire. (a) Note: Paper and cardboard, Ferrous metals, Aluminium, Glass, Plastic SRF P-5.2: Fee modulation in EPR schemes for packaging As explained in Section 2.1.5, fee modulation (or eco-modulation) is a system with different fees for different types of packaging material and designs. The assessment is the same as described in Section 2.1.5 Summary result No EPR scheme and no advanced fee modulation. Denmark has no EPR scheme for all packaging yet, and thus no fee modulation. Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the Danish authorities through the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire. SRF P-5.3 Material specific EPR assessment The material specific assessment is based on a combination of the coverage of the material specific EPR schemes and the use of fee modulation for the specific packaging material. The assessment takes the different situations for different types of materials into account: Plastics packaging is the packaging material that is the most difficult to recycle out of the packaging materials targeted by the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive. Fee modulation therefore plays a larger role for plastic packaging than for the other materials and is therefore rated differently from paper/cardboard, ferrous metals, aluminium and glass. The methodology foresees a green score for plastics packaging only if all four fee modulation assessment criteria mentioned above are met. On the other hand, wooden packaging is mainly generated by commercial and industrial sources and fee modulation is less relevant, therefore the methodology only relies on EPR schemes for wooden packaging from commercial and industrial sources. As described in Section 2.1.5 in more detail, Denmark has no EPR schemes for packaging waste yet. Denmark has a deposit return system for beverage packaging made of plastic, glass or aluminium which operates similar to an EPR scheme as described above. Summary result SRF P-5.3.1 EPR scheme for Paper and cardboard packaging waste No EPR scheme Denmark has no EPR schemes yet. SRF P-5.3.2 EPR scheme for Ferrous metals packaging waste No EPR scheme Denmark has no EPR schemes yet. SRF P-5.3.3 EPR scheme for Aluminium packaging waste No EPR scheme Denmark has no EPR schemes yet. SRF P-5.3.4 EPR scheme for Glass packaging waste No EPR scheme Denmark has no EPR schemes yet. SRF P-5.3.5 EPR scheme for Plastic packaging waste No EPR scheme Denmark has no EPR schemes yet. SRF P-5.3.6 EPR scheme for Wooden packaging waste No EPR scheme Denmark has no EPR schemes yet. Robustness of the underlying information Credible information received from the Danish authorities through the EEA-ETC/WMGE questionnaire. 34 2.3 Target on landfill of municipal waste 2.3.1 Current situation and past trends SRF LF-1.1: Distance to target The Landfill Directive (1999/31/EC), as amended by Directive (EU) 2018/850, sets a target to reduce, by 2035, the amount of municipal waste landfilled to 10 % or less of the total amount of municipal waste generated (by weight). Data to show the current rate of landfilling in line with the reporting rules will only be reported by mid-2022. Therefore, this analysis calculates the landfilling rate based on the current Eurostat dataset Municipal waste by waste management operations [env_wasmun]; by dividing the amount of landfilled waste by the total amount of waste generated. The overall landfilling rate of Denmark was 0.9 % in 2020 (Eurostat, 2022a) . Denmark has a very high incineration capacity, roughly double the amount of municipal waste sent to incineration, and thus landfill rates are expected to stay at a low level also in the future (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021). Summary result Target exceeded The landfilling rate of Denmark was slightly below 1 % in 2020. Robustness of the underlying information The data is derived from Eurostat and is considered to be rather robust. However, the reported landfill rate might increase once the new calculation rules laid down in the Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/1885 will be applied. Based on the available information, it is currently not possible to quantify the impact of the new calculation rules on the landfill rate. SRF LF-1.2: Past trend in municipal solid waste landfill rate Over the past five years, the overall landfilling rate of Denmark has remained steady at about 1 % (Figure 2.4). Figure 2.4 Landfilling in Denmark between 2015 and 2020, in percentage Source: Eurostat (2022a) Summary result Landfill rate < 10% The landfill rate of Denmark was about 1 % throughout the period 2016 to 2020. Robustness of the underlying information The data is derived from Eurostat and is considered to be rather robust. There is no break in the time series data. SRF LF-1.3: Diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from landfill According to Art. 5(2c) of the EU Landfill Directive, Member States had to ensure that by 2016, biodegradable municipal waste going to landfills is reduced to 35 % of the total amount (by weight) of biodegradable municipal waste produced in 1995 or the latest year before 1995 for which standardised Eurostat data is available. Denmark reported 0 % biodegradable waste landfilled in 2019 as share of the biodegradable waste generated in 1995, and performs therefore well within the target (EC, 2021). Summary result Target for reducing the amount of biodegradable municipal waste (BMW) landfilled to 35% of BMW generated in 1995 has been achieved in 2016 Denmark has reported 0 % biodegradable waste landfilled in 2019 as share of the biodegradable waste generated in 1995 and performs therefore well within the target. Robustness of the underlying information Based on officially reported data which is well in line with otherwise reported statistical data on landfilling of municipal waste. 3 Conclusion This risk assessment indicates whether Denmark at risk of not meeting the targets. The ‘total risk’ categorization is the result of the sum of the individual scores of each SRF as described in the previous chapter, where the assessment of each SRF results in a score of 2 points (green), 1 point (amber) or 0 points (red), depending on the assessment of the SRF. As some SRFs are considered to have a higher impact on meeting the target, the score of the SRF is multiplied by the defined weight of the SRF. As some SRFs might not be applicable to Denmark, only the SRFs relevant to Denmark are taken into account to define the maximum score. Denmark is considered to be ‘not at risk’ if its score is more than 50 % of this maximum score, and ‘at risk’ if its score is less than 50 % of this maximum score. 3.1 Prospects for meeting the recycling target for municipal solid waste 65 % of maximum score Based on the provided information and the analysis done, it is concluded that Denmark is not at risk for not meeting the municipal waste recycling target in 2025. Current situation and past trends: The recycling rate was at 53.9 % in 2020, which is 1.1 percentage points below the 2025 target. Considering, however, the impact of the new calculation rules, Denmark has estimated the impact of the application of the new calculation rules on the recycling rate, with the result that the recycling rate would drop by 8 percentage points, to 45.9 %, or 9.1 percentage points below the target. Denmark has an increasing trend in recycling; the recycling rate has increased with 5.6 percentage points during the past five years. Legal instruments: The amended WFD has been transposed into national law in Denmark by the transposition deadline. Denmark reports clearly defined responsibilities, as well as clearly defined enforcement mechanisms for meeting the targets on recycling of municipal waste, in addition Denmark also presents support mechanisms to improve the implementation of the responsible entities. Economic instruments: There is a landfill ban for biodegradable waste and high taxes on both landfilling and incineration. Denmark has a policy for municipal waste collection which allows for the possibility of PAYT-schemes but municipalities often do not implement PAYT. Separate collection systems: A high share of population is covered by high convenience collection services for paper and cardboard, metals, wood, glass, plastics and WEEE. A medium share of population is covered by high convenience collection services for bio-waste. A low share of population is covered by high convenience collection services for textiles. By the end of 2022 at the latest, high convenience separate collection of all examined fractions except wood waste and WEEE will be mandatory in all municipalities in Denmark, which will improve the service level and can be expected to increase the capture rates of recyclables and recycling rates. Extended producer responsibility: The implementation process for setting up an EPR scheme has started. The implementation of an EPR scheme, covering all main packaging materials, is expected to have a positive impact on the separate collection of packaging waste which will, in turn, also impact the capture rates and recycling of municipal waste. Bio-waste treatment capacity and quality management: Increasing the bio-waste treatment capacity is required in order to meet the increasing volumes of separately collected bio-waste. The Danish authorities report the required capacity demand for the treatment of biowaste will be covered by the private sector or the municipalities. Denmark has legally binding national standards for compost quality, but no quality management system yet. 3.2 Prospects for meeting the recycling targets for packaging waste 76 % of maximum score Based on the provided information and the analysis done, it is concluded that Denmark is not at risk for not meeting the 65 % recycling target for packaging waste in 2025 84 % of maximum score Paper and cardboard Not at risk 45 % of maximum score Ferrous metals packaging At risk 84 % of maximum score Aluminium packaging Not at risk 82 % of maximum score Glass packaging Not at risk 46 % of maximum score Plastics packaging At risk 78 % of maximum score Wooden packaging Not at risk Current situation and past trends: The total packaging recycling rate (applying the new calculation rules) in 2019 was 64.1 %, 0.9 percentage points below the 2025 target. There was a small trend of decreasing recycling rates for the period 2015-2019, and the recycling rate in 2019 was lower than in 2015. Plastics and ferrous packaging waste is more than 15 percentage points below the target, once losses during sorting and recycling are taken into account. One of the main reasons for the poor performance on plastics packaging might be that plastics sorting at source is still new to Danish citizens. Legal instruments: The amended Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive has been transposed into national law. Responsibilities for meeting the packaging waste targets are planned to change with the introduction of EPR for packaging, however the organisational set-up for the EPR scheme for packaging is to be decided, and enforcement and support mechanisms are therefore not yet clear. Economic instruments: There is a landfill ban for biodegradable waste and a high tax on incineration. Denmark applies taxes on packaging. There is a policy for municipal waste collection which allows for the possibility of PAYT-schemes but municipalities often do not implement PAYT. Denmark has a mandatory DRS is in place for all aluminium cans, plastic and glass bottles and a voluntary DRS for some specific plastic crates. There is no DRS for wooden packaging. Separate collection systems: As of July 2021 and by end of 2022 at the latest, door-to-door or high convenience bring point separate collection of all packaging materials except wood waste will be mandatory in all municipalities in Denmark, aiming to further improve the service level and increase the collection rates for packaging waste. The need for improvement and introduction of additional mandatory separate collection requirements are a sign of the data on rate of collection for recycling for paper and cardboard not being accurate, indicating also that the data for other packaging waste recycling may not be robust. Separation at source is mandatory in Denmark for both households and also for companies. Extended producer responsibility: Denmark does not have an EPR scheme for packaging yet. Denmark has a deposit return system covering beverage packaging, which operates similar to an EPR-scheme. The process for setting up an EPR scheme for all packaging has started and it is intended to be introduced no later than 31 December 2024. It will cover all types of packaging in all types of materials. 3.3 Prospects of meeting the landfill of municipal waste target 100 % of maximum score Based on the provided information and the analysis done, it is concluded that Denmark is not at risk for not meeting the 2035 target to reduce the amount of municipal waste landfilled to 10 % or less of the total amount of municipal waste generated. Current situation and past trends: The landfilling rate in 2020 was 0.9 %. Over the past five years, the overall landfilling rate of Denmark was about 1 %. Keeping the low landfilling rate should be no problem due to the high incineration capacity in Denmark. Diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from landfill: Denmark reported 0 % biodegradable waste landfilled in 2019 in as share of the biodegradable waste generated in 1995, and performs therefore well within the target.

This report reviews the environmental performance of Denmark since the previous review in 2007. Progress in achieving domestic objectives and international commitments provides the basis for assessing the country’s environmental performance. Such objectives and commitments may be broad aims, qualitative goals or quantitative targets. A distinction is made between intentions, actions and results. Assessment of environmental performance is also placed within the context of Denmark’s historical environmental record, present state of the environment, physical endowment in natural resources, economic conditions and demographic trends. The OECD is indebted to the government of Denmark for its co-operation in providing information, for the organisation of the review mission to Copenhagen (26-29 November 2018) and for facilitating contacts both inside and outside government institutions. Thanks are also due to the representatives of the two examining countries, Andrew McNee (Australia) and Arthur ten Wolde (Netherlands). The authors of this report were Rafal Brykowski, Nathalie Cliquot, Britta Labuhn and Simon Apelblat Thomsen from the OECD Secretariat. Nathalie Girouard and Gérard Bonnis provided oversight and guidance. Carla Bertuzzi provided statistical support, Annette Hardcastle provided administrative support and Rebecca Brite copy-edited the report. Natasha Cline-Thomas provided communications support. Preparation of this report also benefited from inputs and comments from several members of the OECD Secretariat, including Aad van Bohemen, Nils Axel Braathen, Ivana Capozza, Nathalie Delrue, Kathleen Dominique, Mikkel Hermansen, Katia Karousakis, Hannah Leckie, Xavier Leflaive, Eeva Leinala, Eugene Mazur, Will Symes, Özlem Taskin and Jonas Teusch. The OECD Working Party on Environmental Performance discussed the draft Environmental Performance Review of Denmark at its meeting on 25 April 2019 in Paris and approved the Assessment and recommendations.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS  5 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Table of contents Foreword ................................................................................................................................................ 3 Reader’s guide ..................................................................................................................................... 11 Abbreviations and acronyms .............................................................................................................. 12 Basic statistics of Denmark ................................................................................................................. 15 Executive summary ............................................................................................................................. 17 Assessment and recommendations ..................................................................................................... 21 1.1.

It has decoupled its greenhouse gas (GHG) and major air pollutant emissions from economic activity. Denmark ranks among the OECD countries with the lowest energy intensity, thanks to a proactive energy efficiency policy. It has experienced a boom in renewable energy resources over the last decade, with renewables rising from 15% to 35% of total primary energy supply, driven by strong political will and public acceptability. Denmark has become a world leader in wind energy technology thanks to the significant and growing support of electricity consumers (via the electricity bill). It is now committed to increasing the share of renewables in gross final energy consumption from 30% in 2020 to 55% by 2030. Despite progress, environmental challenges persist. In spite of strong nitrogen pollution management policies over the past decade, Denmark still faces excessive levels of nitrogen discharges into its coastal waters, of which only 1.7% are in good ecological status. Denmark’s spatial planning policy promotes the interconnectivity of areas of interest for nature protection, but the nature protection policy does not set targets for protected areas other than biodiversity forests (which represent a very small part of Denmark’s land). Strengthen co-operation with municipalities to improve environmental governance Denmark has a well-functioning environmental governance system at the central level. Particular assets include cross-party political agreements, proactive participation by civil society in policy making and high-quality advisory bodies. Socio-economic impact assessment of government decisions that may have an impact on the environment is used extensively, though not always systematically. Since 2007, Denmark’s 98 municipalities have been responsible for increasing aspects of environmental management. However, environmental rules have not always been applied in comparable ways countrywide. The government has used task forces and sharing of expertise to build capacity in municipalities. Expanding these efforts to domains and regions where municipalities face challenges will be important going forward. Farmland takes up more than 60% of the surface area, making the agriculture sector a key player in the protection of the environment. Spatial planning and land banking are part of the strategies used to manage environmental protection in agriculture. In particular, municipalities must designate existing and potential natural areas on the Green Map and take them into account when preparing land use plans. Efforts to convert environmentally valuable farmland into natural sites through the Multifunctional Land Redistribution Fund could be scaled up, including through the mobilisation of private funds. Involve all sectors of the economy to move towards a carbon-free economy by 2050 Green growth is high on Denmark’s political agenda. The country aspires to achieve 100% green electricity by 2030 and zero net GHG emissions by 2050. It is one of the first countries to develop and implement a green energy strategy based on a broad political 18  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 agreement. This Energy Agreement helps create a climate of trust for investors in clean energy and public acceptability to support the consumer prices of such energy. The 2018 Energy Agreement aims to further develop renewables and improve energy efficiency at market-like conditions. At the same time, energy tax concessions for businesses should be removed as they reduce incentives to save energy and reduce CO2 emissions. Achieving the 2050 goal will, however, require decarbonising sectors beyond energy, such as transport and agriculture. Tax concessions on the purchase and ownership of cars aim to increase the market share of energy-efficient cars and electric cars in the vehicular fleet. These concessions reduced environmentally related tax revenue to 3.7% of GDP, although that remains the highest level in the OECD. Decarbonising the agriculture sector involves identifying low-carbon farming practices, a path in which Denmark has engaged through research and development programmes. Pending transition to cleaner transport and development of mitigation measures for agriculture, Denmark is using flexibility mechanisms to achieve its ambitious goal of reducing GHG emissions outside the EU Emissions Trading System by 39% compared to 2005 levels by 2030. Streamline municipal waste management to foster the circular economy Denmark has long paved the way for circular economy approaches by promoting eco-design, clean production, eco-innovation and sustainable consumption. In 2018, a political agreement was reached on circular economy, with a strong focus on how business can become its engine and how government can help. Nevertheless, total waste generation rose by 30% between 2010 and 2016. Since 2007, Denmark has had the highest levels of municipal waste per capita in the OECD, with 785 kg per inhabitant in 2017. At the same time, the country has managed to nearly eliminate landfilling. It has also achieved impressive results in material recovery of most waste streams. Household waste remains a notable exception, however, with about half going to incineration with energy recovery. Municipalities have considerable autonomy in waste management planning, including on the treatment of most waste. The cost of waste management services is among the highest in OECD Europe. Heavy investment by municipalities in incineration plants has created excess capacity. That, along with a lack of harmonised rules on waste sorting, limits incentives for investment in recycling and reuse. Prioritise chemicals management policy based on risk to health and the environment Denmark has put in place strong institutional and policy frameworks, as well as exemplary stakeholder co-operation, to manage the health and environmental risks associated with the use of chemicals. The shift from an ad-valorem tax on pesticides to an impact-based tax in 2013 reduced by 40% the health, ecotoxicological and environmental risks of pesticides sold, as measured by the pesticide load indicator, from 2011 to 2016. As Denmark relies on imports of chemicals, its policy also focuses on ensuring that imported chemicals and consumer products are safe for the environment and health. To this end, it has developed a high level of expertise in chemical risk assessment, becoming a European and international standard setter in this field. Denmark ranks fifth in the EU for the number of chemical substances assessed and third for endocrine disruptors. Increased monitoring of chemicals in the environment and in consumer products is the first step in managing their health and environmental risks. This should not, however, be detrimental to the predictive risk assessment of chemicals, i.e. before a negative impact can be detected in humans or the environment. Denmark needs to manage the trade-offs between the two – that is, to ensure efficient sharing of budgetary resources between risk-based monitoring of chemicals and predictive risk assessment. Denmark must also EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  19 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 continue to combine national management of chemicals with participation in international efforts to identify and manage the risks associated with chemicals of concern and compliance concerning high-risk chemicals in products.\nASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS  21 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Assessment and recommendations The assessment and recommendations present the main findings of the OECD Environmental Performance Review of Denmark. The 44 recommendations are intended to help Denmark make further progress towards its environmental policy objectives and international commitments. The OECD Working Party on Environmental Performance reviewed and approved the assessment and recommendations at its meeting on 25 April 2019. Actions taken to implement selected recommendations from the 2007 Environmental Performance Review are summarised in the Annex.

Environmental performance: Trends and recent developments Denmark’s1 population enjoys a very high living standard, one of the lowest income inequality levels in the OECD and strong life satisfaction (OECD, 2017[1]; OECD, 2019[2]). Denmark outperforms the OECD average on most Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It has made good progress in decoupling environmental pressures from economic activity. Denmark significantly reduced its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions over the review period, further progressing in the decarbonisation of its economy. Levels of energy and carbon intensity were among the lowest for International Energy Agency countries in 2017 (IEA, 2018[3]; IEA, 2017[4]). The use of cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis continues to guide environmental policy making. Despite this progress, Denmark continues to face environmental challenges. In particular, a significant portion of the population of large Danish cities remains exposed to PM2.5 levels above World Health Organization standards. Denmark will struggle to meet its target of reducing ammonia emissions, set by European Union (EU) legislation, by 2020. Biodiversity is under pressure in many regions, with a large number of red-listed species, a poor state of conservation of natural habitats and low connectivity of ecosystems. Water quality needs to be improved, especially with regard to the presence of pesticides in groundwater and the ecological status of rivers, lakes and coastal waters. 1.1.1. The country has made progress in decarbonising its economy, with the energy sector playing a key role Over the review period, Denmark decoupled energy-related CO2 emissions, GHG emissions and emissions of major air pollutants from growth in gross domestic product (GDP) (Figure 1). The contribution of fossil fuels to total primary energy supply (TPES) dropped significantly, from 82% in 2005 to 60% in 2017. Figure 1.

Energy consumption decreased by 8% between 2005 and 2016. It fell in all sectors except residential, where it remained relatively unchanged. The largest decrease was in the industry sector (25%). The residential and transport sectors are the largest energy consumers, each accounting for one-third of total consumption in 2016 (IEA, 2018[3]). Denmark is one of the leading OECD countries in terms of share of renewable energy sources in TPES, even though its hydropower potential is not comparable to other leading countries (Figure 2). Bioenergy and wind have largely replaced coal in power generation. By 2016, Denmark had already met its 2020 renewables target of 30% of gross final energy consumption. However, bioenergy’s predominant role in the renewables mix raises the issue of environmental sustainability of supply (OECD, 2018[5]), all the more so since Denmark imports nearly half its solid biomass, more than any other OECD country using this resource. Figure 2. Denmark is one of the leaders in use of renewable energy sources StatLink 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888934001540 1.1.2. Denmark has stepped up its efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and is preparing for carbon neutrality by 2050 Between 2005 and 2017, Denmark reduced its GHG emissions by 27.7% (Nielsen et al., 2019[6]) (Figure 3). In June 2018, the government and all parties in the Folketing (the Danish Parliament) agreed a new set of measures to be introduced over 2020-24. This Energy Agreement aims for a 55% share of renewables in primary energy supply by 2030 (Government of Denmark et al., 2018[7]). It specifies that, by 2030, renewables are to cover all final electricity consumption – or even more, allowing for net exports to the European grid – and electricity production from coal is to be phased out. Most of the GHG reductions envisioned in the agreement, totalling 10-11 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent (Mt CO2 eq), are covered by the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). In 2016, emissions covered by the EU ETS accounted for one-third of Denmark’s GHG emissions. Between 2005 and 2017, EU ETS emissions from stationary sources decreased by 43%, well above the EU average of 14% (EEA, 2018[8]; Nielsen et al., 2018[9]).

Under the Energy Agreement, feed-in tariffs will be replaced by technology-neutral one-off investment grants in a move to solutions that are more responsive to changing market conditions. Some DKK 4.2 billion (EUR 564 million) is to be allocated for this purpose from the state budget for 2020-24. Figure 3. More measures to reduce GHG emissions are needed if Denmark is to achieve its long-term goal StatLink 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888934001559 The EU Effort Sharing Decision commits Denmark to reduce its non-EU ETS emissions by 39% from the 2005 level by 2030. This is one of the most ambitious reduction targets in the EU. Between 2005 and 2017, non-ETS emissions decreased more slowly than EU ETS emissions, by 18% (Eurostat, 2019[10]). Under the Effort Sharing Decision Denmark has chosen for the sake of cost-effectiveness to rely on flexibility mechanisms to achieve the 39% target. Two-thirds of the GHG reductions it envisions for non-EU ETS emissions, about 21 Mt CO2 eq, are to be achieved through credits in the land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector and one-third by cancellation of EU ETS quotas. In October 2018, the government prepared a climate and air proposal, Together for a Greener Future, to reduce non-EU ETS GHG emissions (and air pollutants). Among other measures, it proposes halting sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030 and supporting research and development (R&D) to develop low-GHG farming (EUR 12 million) and carbon capture and storage on farmland and in forests (EUR 14 million). Measures approved in the Finance Act for 2019 include an increased premium for scrapping old diesel cars, grants for investing in low-carbon barn technology and research on better estimating carbon sequestration in soil and forests. To help reach a goal of 1 million electric vehicle sales by 2030, electric and plug-in hybrid cars below DKK 400 000 (EUR 54 000) are exempt from the registration tax in 2019 and 2020, and the government has established a transport commission, giving the municipalities the option to offer cheaper and prioritised parking of green vehicles and allowing them to drive in bus lanes. The Energy Agreement ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS  25 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 and climate and air proposal are key steps for Denmark to make its economy climate-neutral by 2050, in line with the long-term EU strategic vision. 1.1.3. Particle pollution in cities and agricultural ammonia emissions remain problems Denmark is on track to meet its 2020 targets under the EU National Emissions Ceilings (NEC) Directive for nitrogen oxides (NOX), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) and sulphur oxides (SOX). It will be more difficult for it to meet its NEC commitments for 2020 and 2030 on fine particles (PM2.5) and ammonia (MEF, 2019[11]). Domestic steps to improve urban air quality include low-emission zones in major cities, registration tax exemption for electric cars, particle filters for new fossil-fuelled cars and enhanced emission limit values for residential wood stoves. Measures have also been taken to reduce ammonia emissions, such as banning manure application by splash plate and a requirement to roof slurry tanks. Denmark submitted its NEC implementation programme, the National Air Pollution Control Programme, to the European Commission for approval in April 2019. It proposes measures to reduce ammonia emissions, such as financial support for low-emission barns and regulation of urea-based chemical fertilisers. The proposed measures to reduce PM2.5 focus on cleaner transport and accelerated replacement of old residential wood stoves. The number of premature deaths caused by ambient air pollution continues to be above the OECD average (Figure 4). The Danish Center for Environment and Energy at Aarhus University estimates that 3 200 premature deaths a year are attributable to air pollution, including transboundary pollution, with exposure to PM2.5 implicated in 90% of cases (Ellermann et al., 2018[12]). The welfare cost related to PM2.5 exposure is estimated at 3% of GDP (OECD, 2018[13]). Figure 4.

More coherent and proactive policies are needed to foster nature conservation The 2014 Biodiversity Strategy does not include targets for protected areas. The vast majority of open habitats (i.e. natural areas with no tree cover and additionally most freshwater lakes), about 10% of the country’s area, are included in Section 3 of the Nature Protection Act, which gives them general protection against activities that can have a direct negative impact on their integrity. This does not mean, however, that some extensive farming practices cannot continue. The area of Section 3 habitats increased by 9% in 2006-16 (EPA[14]). Until 2008, Denmark had no national parks. Five have since been created, parts of which are privately owned. The national parks are established by assignment agreements and managed at the local level. Their management imposes regulation on specific activities within the parks by designating different planning zones. The 2016-19 Nature Package envisages increasing the area of “biodiversity forests” from 11 700 ha in 2016 to 28 300 ha in 2066, mainly in state-owned forest. By January 2019, 22 800 ha had been designated in state-owned forests. “Biodiversity forests” have a stricter biodiversity protection target than other forests and have less intensive or no management. The new National Forest Programme, adopted in 2018, builds on the objectives of its predecessor: i) increase forest cover to 20-25% of the land by the end of the century (it is now less than 15%) and ii) make protecting biodiversity the main goal for 10% of all forests by 2040. Natura 2000 sites cover some 8% of the land area and 18% of the exclusive economic zone. However, 68% of the total area of habitats and 27% of species covered by the EU Habitats Directive are in unfavourable or bad conservation status (Figure 5), and 27% of assessed plant and animal species are red-listed. Figure 5. The state of most habitats remains unfavourable StatLink 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888934001597 Amendments to the Planning Act in 2015 and 2017 require municipalities to designate the location of areas of special nature protection interest on a map, including Natura 2000 areas on land and other protected natural areas as well as ecological corridors, potential natural areas and potential ecological corridors.

Preparation of the Green Map is a key element of Danish nature conservation policy. The map should enable targeting of municipalities’ nature protection initiatives. It will be developed gradually as municipalities revise their land-use plans. Once designated, it will provide a clearer picture of the extent and location of existing and potential areas of special nature protection interest and indicate where to create such areas and corridors to link them. Danish reporting to international organisations has overestimated the number of protected areas compliant with the standards of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Thus any comparison with the Aichi targets under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) is distorted. For example, it would appear that the total number of IUCN-compliant areas protected by specific conservation orders is of the order of 400, rather than the 1 843 previously reported under the CBD. The Ministry of Environment and Food (MEF) estimated in April 2019 that 15% of the land area in Denmark is protected in accordance with the Nature Protection Act or Natura 2000, or both. Many water bodies do not achieve the good ecological status required by the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD). This is particularly true of coastal waters, the vast majority of which do not achieve the goal (Figure 6). Measures under the 2005-09 Action Plan for the Aquatic Environment III and 2009-15 River Basin Management Plan (RBMP) helped reduce the agricultural nitrogen surplus by 7% between 2005-07 and 2013-15, though it remains above the OECD average (Figure 6). Figure 6. The quality of coastal waters is of concern and the agricultural nitrogen surplus remains above the OECD average StatLink 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888934001616 To achieve the WFD objectives, Denmark needs to reduce nitrogen discharges to coastal waters to 44 700 tonnes a year by 2027, compared with around 60 000 tonnes in 2013-15. To this end, EUR 830 million, just over half the 2015-21 RBMP budget, is devoted to coastal water protection (wetland creation, afforestation, farmland set-asides, catch crops, kg/ha of agricultural area a) Quality of water bodies according to the standards of the EU Water Framework Directive.

The 2015 Food and Agriculture Package introduced a policy shift towards more cost-effective “targeted regulation”. Until 2017, Denmark had a regulation where the same rules applied to all farmers. With the targeted catch crops programme from 2017 and targeted regulation from 2019, Denmark has implemented a differentiated system. The targeted regulation is based on water pollution risk. This is a step in the right direction, as it improves cost-effectiveness by focusing efforts on vulnerable areas, in line with the spirit of the WFD and the EU Nitrates Directive. Targeted regulation aims to focus on watersheds threatened by nitrogen pollution, leaving farmers in other watersheds more flexibility in managing the use of their nutrients than was the case with non-targeted regulation (MEF, 2015[15]). The intensity of agricultural pesticide use is below the OECD average in terms of sales. However the presence of pesticides and their metabolites in groundwater remains a concern. In 2015-17, prohibited (legacy) pesticides were detected in groundwater intended for human consumption at levels exceeding the limit value for drinking water of 0.1 μg/litre in 7.2% of the 1 086 intakes studied. By comparison, authorised pesticides and their metabolites were detected at levels exceeding the limit of 0.1 μg/l in 1.6 % of these intakes (GEUS, 2019[16]). In 2019, municipalities were asked to demarcate protection zones around drinking water wells and enforce them using voluntary approaches. If this proves ineffective, from 2022 a political agreement concluded in 2019 reserves the right to impose pesticide-free agriculture in the protection zones. Some water companies have taken the lead in deciding to pay farmers not to use pesticides in the areas concerned. Recommendations on climate, air, biodiversity and water Mitigating climate change  Make every effort to achieve the goal of further reducing GHG emissions by 2030, including identifying misalignment of sectoral policies with climate policy, mobilising private finance and seeking synergies with other environmental policies (on air, water, waste, biodiversity).  Develop a vision for a carbon-neutral Denmark by 2050, considering the development and export promotion of technological solutions (for energy efficiency, renewables, and carbon capture and storage) and cost-effectiveness (including using international carbon markets to offset emissions). Improving air quality  Redouble efforts to reduce ammonia emissions so as to achieve the 2030 target set by the NEC Directive; in particular, seek synergies with nitrate policies, taking into account the nitrogen cycle; ensure policy coherence between ammonia emission management and expansion of biogas as a renewable energy resource.  Continue efforts to address urban PM2.5 pollution, including reducing particle emissions from residential wood burning.  Strengthen international co-operation to support Denmark’s efforts to control transboundary air pollution from international ship traffic. ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS  29 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Addressing biodiversity  Update the 2014 Biodiversity Strategy in light of initiatives put in place since its launch (e.g. Nature Package, National Forest Programme, Rural Development Programme, Green Map), and ensure their coherence; pending development of the Green Map by 2050, set intermediate targets for protected areas and connectivity, taking into account progress on the CBD Biodiversity Strategic Plan 2021-30.  Provide sufficient public financial support to achieve the goal for “biodiversity forests” on both state-owned and private land; evaluate their impact, as well as that of the policy of increasing forest cover, on carbon sequestration.  Establish a natural area connectivity strategy targeting threatened species, in close partnership with civil society and municipalities. Improving water quality  Continue to improve the cost-effectiveness of measures to reduce nitrate pollution of coastal waters; in particular, continue to implement the targeted regulation, focusing on watersheds at risk; estimate the effects of this targeted regulation on N2O emissions with a view to seeking synergies.  Improve the effectiveness of voluntary approaches to farmers in preventing pesticide use around drinking water abstraction wells; in particular, incorporate the suggestion that additional instruments will have to be applied if the objective of pesticide-free areas is not achieved. 1.2. Environmental governance and management Denmark has a well-functioning environmental governance and management system. It is characterised by high levels of co-operation and consensus. Particular assets include an informal system of cross-party political agreements, strong participation by civil society in policy making and high-quality independent advisory bodies. Denmark also benefits from expertise in socio-economic assessment of policies at its universities and in ministries. Finally, it has a comprehensive risk-based inspection system in place. There is scope to use the existing expertise in socio-economic assessment more systematically in policy making. Despite the strong risk-based inspection system, analysis of non-compliance among companies is limited. Given the important responsibilities of municipalities, strengthening their capacity, including by sharing expertise, in domains and regions where they face environmental problems must be a priority, along with ensuring that environmental rules are applied in comparable ways countrywide. 1.2.1. Municipalities are responsible for most aspects of environmental management In Denmark’s environmental governance and management system, many responsibilities are devolved to the municipalities. The national level sets the legal framework and provides guidance on implementation. It also develops national plans, programmes and strategies. Inter-ministerial co-ordination on environment-related policies at the central level is well established. Following a landmark reform of the local government structure in 2007, Denmark’s 98 municipalities became responsible for most aspects of environmental 30  ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 management. This is consistent with a tradition of municipal autonomy, enshrined in the Constitution. Municipal responsibilities include municipal and local planning; implementation of policies, plans and programmes; the issuance of most environmental permits; and related inspections. National authorities retain oversight on environmental permits and inspections for the most complex and potentially harmful companies. The five regions have limited environmental responsibilities, which the government has proposed to abolish. As the 2007 OECD Environmental Performance Review (EPR) recommended, task forces were set up to help build municipal capacity following the 2007 reform. The introduction of management planning at river basin level in 2009 improved inter-municipal co-operation in water and nature management. More generally, municipalities share expertise and best practices through Local Government Denmark, an association to which all municipalities belong. Denmark should expand the use of task forces to areas where it faces challenges, such as waste prevention (Section 4). Further guidance on implementation of environmental legislation could be strengthened by learning from international best practice, e.g. Switzerland’s “enforcement aids” to its cantons. 1.2.2. Expertise in socio-economic assessment is extensive, but could be used more systematically Denmark has a good record on the speed and quality of transposition of EU environmental legislation. The number of complaints and infringement cases is low. To enhance political stability and policy continuity, the government often seeks to form political agreements with parties outside government. This system is a major asset for the country. It has helped bring about positive long-term change, such as stable investment in renewables. Direct environmental regulation is still the most widely used policy instrument. However, Denmark increasingly favours direct regulation based on results rather than requiring specific practices, e.g. in its targeted approach to nitrogen regulation of farms. This gives producers flexibility on how to comply and improves cost-effectiveness (OECD, 2018[17]). Environmental impact assessment is an integral part of the permitting process. The EU Strategic Environment Assessment (SEA) Directive was transposed into Danish law in 2004. SEAs were conducted on changes to rules on farmers’ fertiliser use under the 2015 Food and Agriculture Package and on the siting of offshore windfarms, among other things. Important government plans and programmes typically rely on extensive prior assessment of the cost and benefits of targets or the cost-effectiveness of measures. Denmark also implemented a recommendation in the last EPR by prioritising monitoring of national environmental action plans in its national monitoring programme, NOVANA. Advisory bodies, such as the Environmental Economic Council and the Climate Council, evaluate public policies ex post and make ex ante recommendations with a strong focus on improving cost-effectiveness. An independent body, Rigsrevisionen, audits public spending on behalf of Parliament. In 2017, the government revised guidelines on socio-economic impact assessment (SEIA). Making SEIA mandatory on government decisions that would have a significant environmental impact could further enhance the quality of policy making. It would also allow strengthening of regulatory impact assessment (RIA) of draft laws, which have not always been subject to SEIA (OECD, 2018[18]). In addition to effects within its borders, Denmark should consider separately quantifying the effects of its environmental policies in other countries – such as health benefits in neighbouring countries resulting from Danish air pollution measures – and taking them into account in RIA (OECD, 2018[19]). ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS  31 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 1.2.3. Land-use planning should target better distribution between agriculture and nature protection Municipalities are responsible for translating national guidelines into concrete spatial planning. Municipal plans are issued every 4 years and have a 12 year time frame. Local plans are the most detailed level of spatial planning. They establish rules on how land in a local area can be used and developed (OECD, 2018[19]). Spatial planning must take into account existing and potential natural areas designated on the Green Map. The aim is to improve biodiversity by reinforcing efforts to establish larger and more interconnected natural areas and ensure coherence between designations in neighbouring municipalities. Farmland takes up more than 60% of the surface area and puts pressure on the environment, especially on peatlands (drained peatlands become net GHG emission sources) and near sensitive natural areas and water bodies. Since 1990, land consolidation and land banking have proved essential in improving both agricultural productivity (through structural adjustment) and nature conservation (by offsetting nature conservation land banked with farmland) (Hartvigsen, 2014[20]). However, public funding for land redistribution has been significantly reduced since the structural adjustment policy was discontinued in 2006. In 2018, a Multifunctional Land Redistribution Fund (MLRF) was established with a budget of EUR 33 million. In February 2019, Denmark’s two main environmental and agricultural interest groups jointly recommended raising the fund’s budget by at least EUR 130 million (Danish Society for Nature Conservation and Danish Agriculture & Food Council, 2019[21]). The aim is to be able to seize opportunities to buy land where farming has a significant environmental impact – e.g. peatlands, farms near ammonia-sensitive nature areas or drinking water wells – and convert it to natural areas or grasslands as well as to support rural development and access to landscapes and nature. This would support Denmark’s ambition to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. It would also deliver co-benefits on biodiversity, water and air quality, and climate adaptation. However, determining the merits of scaling up public funding of the MLRF with respect to expected environmental policy benefits requires cost-effectiveness analysis. In addition to budgetary resources, private funds could be mobilised to finance the MLRF. Denmark has already shown leadership in this area through the Climate Investment Fund. Recent OECD work illustrates the range of interventions public actors can use to attract institutional investment in low-carbon infrastructure, which could include the land purchases envisaged by the MLRF (Röttgers, Tandon and Kaminker, 2018[22]). 1.2.4. The environmental inspection system is effective, but enforcement is uneven Denmark applies a risk-based approach to environmental inspections, in line with the EU Industrial Emissions Directive. It assigns a risk score to companies based on five parameters. The most potentially harmful companies are inspected at least every three years, while the least potentially harmful are inspected at least every six years. Denmark applies a risk-based inspection system even to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which is good practice. In a positive step, a national inspection database called Danish Environmental Administration was set up in 2016. Inspection data from 2017 indicate that the system is effective in finding violations. They also show that the companies posing the biggest potential risks to the environment are subject to the most compliance promotion and enforcement measures. Denmark is starting to use the database more strategically to improve its inspection efforts. From 2020, it plans to target guidance to industries where inspection data point to a need for special efforts to reduce the number of violations. 32  ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Making fuller use of the database should help Denmark gain a better understanding of non-compliance among companies and inform policy making. Authorities have three categories of compliance promotion and enforcement measures at their disposal: reporting companies to the police, issuing enforcement orders to prescribe corrective actions and making non-binding recommendations. Recommendations can take the form of an agreement between authorities and companies on specific improvements to be undertaken. Guidance documents on the use of compliance promotion and enforcement measures have existed since 2005 (EPA, 2005[23]), but in practice, municipalities vary in which measures they use and to what degree (Figure 7). In 2017, recommendations made up 21.5% of all reactions recorded following inspections of the potentially most environmentally harmful companies. However, 11% of municipalities have opted for a more instructive (less punitive) approach by choosing recommendations more often than enforcement orders. Eight municipalities issued five times as many recommendations as enforcement orders. Figure 7. Compliance promotion and enforcement vary across municipalities To create a level playing field for companies, national authorities should ensure that municipalities promote compliance with environmental rules and enforce them in a comparable manner (Mazur, 2011[24]) while respecting municipal autonomy and taking differences in the regional distribution of industries into account. In 2017, the MEF launched a new enforcement strategy for its agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The strategy includes scaling up guidance efforts and ensuring transparent and uniform treatment of companies. The results of the strategy should be used to give municipalities additional, evidence-based criteria for identifying appropriate compliance promotion and enforcement measures. In addition, the EPA could illustrate its guidance documents with examples from actual cases in municipalities. No environmental police or environmental courts exist. Regular police and courts are essentially responsible for imposing fines if violations are reported. However, as municipalities rarely report companies to the police (Figure 7), fines are seldom used. This may indicate that the level of fines is high enough that companies do not expose themselves to the risk of violating environmental legislation. It may also indicate that companies take Share of municipalities issuing more recommenda-tions than enforcement orders 11% Share of municipalities issuing more enforcement orders than recommendations 89% Use of recommendations and enforcement orders by municipal authorities, 2017 Enforcement orders 78.1% Reported to police 0.4% Recommendations 21.5% Reactions by type, 2017 Note: Data refer to inspections carried out by municipalities in the most potentially harmful companies. Source: Country submission.\nCompliance promotion and enforcement measures used by municipalities following environmental inspections ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS  33 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 seriously the possibility of municipalities escalating the choice of compliance promotion and enforcement measures should violations not be corrected (OECD, 2009[25]) Denmark does not have an environmental code. In 2017, a panel of legal experts recommended simplifying the structure of environmental legislation while keeping the current level of protection. It estimated that the number of environmental laws could be reduced from 95 to 43. Initial steps have been taken to follow up on the panel’s recommendations. For example, obsolete rules on agriculture were repealed. Denmark should pursue such efforts to simplify its environmental legislation further in order to promote compliance and enforcement. Voluntary environmental agreements and formalised partnerships between the public and private sectors are in place. When agreements include quantitative targets, they are backed by the explicit possibility of regulatory action, in line with OECD best practice (OECD, 2003[26]). 1.2.5. Environmental democracy is strong Public participation in environmental matters is excellent. The Environmental Information Act implements the UNECE Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (the Aarhus Convention). The act has a broad scope of application. The ombudsman of Parliament, a citizens’ watchdog, has contributed to this by issuing opinions on public authorities’ use of the act. In the absence of environmental courts, an appeal board of judges and experts serves as the first instance of redress for citizens and associations against administrative decisions in the environmental field. From 2011 to 2015, it reduced its average processing time for complaints from 369 days to 182, making access to justice quicker. The trend was partly reversed in 2016 when the board was relocated. Danish authorities use information campaigns to raise public awareness of environmental issues. In recent years, initiatives have been taken to help elementary schools educate children on environmental issues such as the SDGs, climate change, biodiversity and food waste. 34  ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Recommendations on environmental governance and management Supporting the institutional framework  Expand the use of task forces to build municipal capacity in the areas of environmental management where they face challenges, such as waste prevention.  Further strengthen guidance to municipalities on implementation of environmental legislation to make it easier to use, as Switzerland does with its enforcement aids to cantons. Making land use more sustainable  Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of scaling up land acquisition and redistribution of environmentally valuable agricultural land through the MLRF. Strengthening policy evaluation framework  Consider making SEIA mandatory for government policy decisions with a significant environmental impact, including in the context of RIA, based on the 2017 SEIA guidelines.  Consider separately quantifying effects in other countries when conducting cost-benefit analyses of Danish environmental policies, e.g. health benefits in neighbouring countries resulting from Danish air pollution measures. Promoting and ensuring compliance  While respecting municipal autonomy, create a level playing field for companies by ensuring that municipalities apply compliance promotion and enforcement measures based on well-established and similar criteria; in particular, update the EPA compliance promotion and enforcement guidance documents with factual findings from the enforcement strategy and concrete examples from municipalities.  Continue efforts to make fuller use of the Danish Environmental Administration database on environmental inspections to gain better understanding of non-compliance among companies and to inform policy making.  Pursue efforts to simplify environmental legislation to further promote compliance and enforcement. 1.3. Towards green growth 1.3.1. Ambitious targets for green growth and commitment to sustainable development Green growth ranks high on Denmark’s political agenda. The country aspires to achieve 100% green electricity by 2030 and net zero GHG emissions by 2050. It is one of the first countries to implement a green energy strategy based on a broad political agreement, which helps create a climate of trust for investors. The commitment to address environmental challenges while ensuring economic success through clean technology exports has made Denmark a pioneer of green growth. Exports and revenue from the Danish clean tech ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS  35 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 industry will become increasingly important for the economy as production and associated revenue from oil and gas extraction decline. Denmark’s green growth policy increasingly aims for cost-effectiveness in achieving environmental objectives while ensuring that measures benefit employment and competitiveness. This is reflected in the recently adopted Energy Agreement for 2020-24. Pending transition to electric vehicles and development of mitigation technology for agriculture, Denmark has chosen to make significant use of flexibility mechanisms to achieve its ambitious goal of reducing GHG emissions outside the EU ETS (Section 1). Reaching carbon neutrality by 2050 requires continued investment, R&D in low-carbon technology, and options such as carbon capture and storage and carbon sequestration. Policy making benefits from engagement of stakeholder and expert groups, which are frequently consulted on major policy initiatives. Denmark played a leadership role in the development of Agenda 2030 and was among the first countries to conduct a voluntary national review on progress towards SDGs. Efforts should continue to broaden the statistical base for SDG reporting and to harmonise key indicators with international ones. A comprehensive report on Green National Accounts for Denmark was published in 2018, comprising information on the natural resource stock, resource use and resulting pollution, and green economy aspects. It could be the basis for regular reporting on green growth. 1.3.2. In a long history of green taxation, adjustments are still necessary Denmark’s public finances are strong. The country is known for balanced budgets and low public debt levels. The tax burden is high: in 2017 Denmark ranked second among OECD countries for tax/GDP ratio, after France. While revenue from environmentally related taxes has declined in real terms over time (Figure 8) because of a decrease in revenue from motor vehicle registration taxes (mostly due to deductions to fuel efficient cars), it still equalled 3.7% of GDP in 2017, the highest share among OECD countries and more than twice the OECD average. Denmark is a pioneer in carbon pricing. Nearly all energy-related CO2 emissions face a price signal, except those from burning of woody biomass for heating. The use of bioenergy is assumed to be carbon neutral, in line with EU renewables policy. Overall, 32% of emissions faced a price above EUR 30 per tonne of CO2 in 2015, which is similar to the OECD average. 36  ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Figure 8. Environmentally related tax revenue has declined StatLink 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888934001635 Taxes on energy imposed on households, like other environmentally related taxes, are generally much higher than those imposed on businesses, for reasons of competitiveness. The ordinary household electricity tax is the most extreme example: it is some 200 times higher than the rate on manufacturing, etc., making it the highest in the European Union. Denmark has had a deliberate policy of allocating revenue from an additional tax on electricity consumption (the Public Service Obligation, PSO, introduced in 2012) to development of renewables, on a kind of “electricity pays for (renewable) electricity” principle. Although this has disadvantages from a macroeconomic point of view (for example, it limits budgetary flexibility), it has proved effective in supporting wind energy deployment. Without this investment subsidy, combined with feed-in tariffs, the rapid deployment of wind energy technology, and reduction in production costs, would not have been possible. The new Energy Agreement still provides for wind energy investment subsidies. As the PSO is phased out over 2017-21, the aim is to lower electricity taxes and finance subsidies to wind and other renewables from the general budget. The government’s plans to reduce electricity taxes will encourage more people to abandon fossil-fuelled and wood stove heating. The Energy Agreement also gradually reduces the electricity tax on electric heating in a bid to make this option more attractive than fossil fuel and biomass solutions, while reducing the tax burden. In the context of overall high energy taxes, exemption of woody biomass from the energy duty and CO2 tax has led to a boom in its use in cogeneration of heat and electricity. However, high reliance on woody biomass is problematic if it leads to unsustainable forest management, including in third countries (almost half the biomass used is imported). Energy utilities have put in place a voluntary programme to ensure sustainable use of biomass, which includes sustainable management of the forests from which the biomass is derived. As in many other OECD countries, petrol is taxed significantly more heavily than diesel, which is not justifiable from an environmental perspective. Rather than raising diesel taxes, Denmark applies an annual countervailing charge on private diesel cars (in addition to the registration and annual vehicle taxes) in a bid to avoid fuel tourism to neighbouring countries. 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 0 20 40 60 80 100 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 % DKK billion, 2010 prices Environmentally related tax revenue by tax base, 2005-17 Energy products Motor vehicles and transport Pollution and resources % of GDP (right axis) Source: OECD (2018), “Environmental policy instruments”, OECD Environment Statistics (database); EU (2018), National Tax List (NTLs); Statistics Denmark (2019), “Green economy: Environmental taxes”, StatBank (database).\nASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS  37 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 However, the charge does not fully offset the low diesel tax, notably for cars driving above-average distances per year. Thus, the charge has not eliminated the effect of the diesel differential. Most trucks, buses and tractors are exempt from the charge or pay a relatively low rate. Denmark would benefit from phasing out the reduced energy duty for diesel, especially if it co-ordinated the phase-out with similar moves in neighbouring countries. End-user prices for diesel are lower in Germany, although higher in Sweden and Norway. Vehicle ownership is heavily taxed, mainly through the high registration tax. This has led to a relatively low vehicle ownership rate, but has also discouraged renewal of the car fleet: passenger cars in Denmark average 8.9 years, above the EU average (EEA, 2018[27]). The registration tax is differentiated by vehicle fuel consumption. The requirements became more stringent in 2017. The annual vehicle tax is also based on fuel efficiency. Both taxes have been effective in encouraging purchases of fuel-efficient cars. The gradual abandonment of exemption of electric vehicles from the registration tax, combined with a reduction in the rate for all vehicles, led to a drop in electric vehicle sales between 2016 and 2018. Hence it was decided to reinforce the fiscal advantage, at least for 2019 and 2020. Denmark should consider additional measures to support the diffusion of electric vehicles, such as interoperable charging stations (each of the three main operators has its own membership system) or free access to bus lanes, as provided for in the climate and air proposal. Shifting vehicle taxation from ownership to use would enhance environmental effectiveness. The government has reduced the registration tax several times in recent years while the annual vehicle tax has been increased. These changes have not been accompanied by an increase in the fuel tax or introduction of tolls (other than existing tolls on two bridges and Eurovignette for vehicles over 12 tonnes). Reducing the tax burden on vehicles can have a rebound effect, as fleet expansion reverses the emission reductions achieved by increasingly fuel-efficient cars. Plans in 2012 to introduce a congestion charge in Copenhagen have been replaced by an air quality protection plan to reduce particle and NOX pollution. For the past ten years, Denmark’s four largest cities have been implementing low-emission zones to limit diesel truck traffic in city centres. Only trucks that meet the Euro 4 (since 2010), Euro 5 (from 2020) and Euro 6 (from 2022) standards can circulate. Trucks are not subject to registration tax. The current taxation of trucks fails to internalise the external environmental costs. Previous attempts to internalise such costs (e.g. through road tolls per kilometre driven on certain roads) have been abandoned because they were considered very costly. Public spending on rail has increased considerably to modernise network signalling (DKK 20 billion, EUR 2.7 billion) and electrify the railway (DKK 7 billion, EUR 0.9 billion). Announced in March 2019, a new political agreement on infrastructure investment envisages increasing railway investment in coming years to DKK 51.5 billion (EUR 6.9 billion). In addition, there are plans to buy new electric trains, which could cost as much as DKK 20 billion (EUR 2.7 billion). The climate and air proposal plans to reduce GHG emissions in non-EU ETS sectors. Its ambition is for all new cars from 2030 onwards to be low- or zero-emission vehicles. A commission for a green transition of all passenger cars has been asked to deliver a strategy on how this ambition can best be realised while maintaining adequate revenue. Meanwhile, a partnership between the government and two large agricultural organisations was established to co-ordinate R&D on GHG mitigation techniques in agriculture and ways to encourage such techniques, in synergy with techniques and policies for managing nitrates and ammonia. 38  ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 However, Denmark taxes NOX and SOX emissions at rates below the indicative values used by MEF for cost-benefit analysis. Its landfill and waste incineration taxes have reduced the amount of waste going to landfill but not the amount for incineration (Section 4). Nevertheless, it is one of the few countries to tax pesticides, and in 2013 it went from a retail value tax to one that reflects health and environmental risks (Section 5). It and the Netherlands were the first countries to regulate nitrogen and phosphorus excess through a quota system at the farm level. Denmark and the EU co-finance a Rural Development Programme (RDP), under which DKK 1.1 billion (EUR 148 million) a year was spent on environment-related agricultural activities in 2015-19, including green investment in farms, organic farming and protection of nature and water quality. Payments for protection of the aquatic environment increased from EUR 30 million to EUR 100 million over the period, while payments for biodiversity protection remained in the range of EUR 30 million to EUR 50 million. Farms that convert agricultural peatland to nature areas lose income support under the EU Common Agricultural Policy. Denmark thus decided to compensate farmers converting peatland into nature areas, spending DKK 65 million (EUR 8.7 million) annually in 2016-19. Denmark should evaluate the side effects of the RDP measures on GHG emissions with a view to seeking co-benefits. For example, conversion of peatlands could reduce some 15% of agricultural GHG emissions through carbon sequestration (Dubgaard and Ståhl, 2018[28]). Incentives could also be developed to mobilise private investment in carbon sequestration, for instance through development of voluntary or, in the medium term, mandatory offset markets. However, current EU policies limit the potential. The EU 2030 Climate and Energy Framework caps how much member states can use carbon sequestration to meet their GHG reduction targets for non-EU ETS sectors. 1.3.3. Denmark invests in renewables and is a leader in innovation Denmark has experienced an investment boom in renewables over the last decade, driven by strong political leadership and targeted support policies. Support expenditure for renewables has increased significantly since 2010 due to the growing number of eligible projects (notably in wind energy) and low electricity market prices. More than half of electricity now benefits from public support for investment, market price support and tax breaks (compared to 16% across 26 EU countries), mainly for wind energy and combined heat and power (IEA, 2017[4]). The Energy Agreement provides for a switch to yearly technology-neutral tenders for wind and solar-photovoltaic projects in 2018 and 2019, which will be extended to incorporate more technologies in the coming years, reduce public support and thus improve cost-effectiveness. Subsidies to biogas plants have reached record levels. However, in early 2019, the political parties that signed the Energy Agreement decided to stop support to new plants under the present support programme as of 1 January 2020 and instead introduce a tender system. Yet biogas does not lack environmental benefits. For example, using manure as a raw material for biogas instead of spreading it as fertiliser reduces the risk of air pollution (ammonia) and water pollution (nitrates), and digested manure is a high-quality natural fertiliser that emits much less nitrous oxide than untreated manure. Several gas, oil, electricity and district heating companies have voluntarily committed to an annual energy savings target as part of the 2012-20 Energy Savings Agreement. This energy efficiency obligation (EEO) is financed by end consumers through their energy bill, on the “energy pays for energy (saving)” principle. The EEO implements the EU Energy Efficiency Directive, which aims for 20% energy savings by 2020 at EU level, in terms of ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS  39 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 primary and final energy consumption. Due to concerns about limited effectiveness and its impact on consumer tariffs, Denmark decided to have the EEO cease in 2021. A new call for tenders will take over and energy saving costs will be financed from the general budget. Public expenditure on transport increased by more than 50% in real terms over 2005-16, driven by a large increase in rail infrastructure investment (ITF, 2019[30]). This reflects a commitment in the 2009 Transport Agreement to improve public transport, including an extension of the metro in Copenhagen and financial support to development of light railways in Aarhus and Odense. In addition, in 2014, the government at the time agreed on a DKK 28.5 billion (EUR 3.8 billion) investment in new railways, upgrading of existing railways and electrification of the rail network (IEA, 2017[4]). However, the Train Fund, intended to finance these investments, was later limited in scope. A recent agreement announced an infrastructure investment of DKK 112 billion (EUR 15 billion) for 2021-30. Denmark should consider re-evaluating the proposed project pipeline, as it contains projects that were found to have negative socio-economic effects. Public spending on environmental protection amounted to about DKK 34 billion (EUR 4.4 billion) in 2017 (SD, 2018[31]), or 1.5% of GDP. This includes expenditure for waste and wastewater management (72%), protection of biodiversity and landscapes (13%) and protection of ground and surface water, air pollution control, and public administration of environmental protection (15%). Most waste and wastewater expenditure is recovered from households through user fees, which is why household spending as a share of total final consumption expenditure (1.6% in 2016) is the highest in the EU (Eurostat, 2019[32]). High user fees may reflect high quality of service and full cost recovery, but also service provision inefficiency. In the waste sector, for example, municipalities are not required to compete with private companies for waste collection and treatment. In the water sector, cost-effective behaviour is encouraged in the 2009 Water Sector Act, which sets requirements with respect to companies’ operating costs based on benchmarking, as well as a price ceiling. Recap regulation has helped halt water price increases and improve utilities’ efficiency; tariffs have remained relatively stable since 2009. Denmark is one of the innovation leaders in Europe, and its patents have the highest level of specialisation in environmental technology among OECD countries (Figure 9). Measured per capita, Denmark ranks second for environment-related inventions, after Korea. The Danish wind industry is recognised as a world leader. The budget for innovation in clean technology was reduced by half over 2013-16 (IEA, 2019[33]). However, Denmark has committed to increasing it again under Mission Innovation. The Energy Agreement confirms this commitment, increasing the clean energy innovation budget to DKK 580 million (EUR 78 million) in 2020 and DKK 1 billion (EUR 134 million) in 2024, bringing it back to 2010 levels. Business R&D spending is highly concentrated in a few large companies; incentives for R&D should also be made available to start-ups, which are often more innovative than their larger counterparts. 40  ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Figure 9. Denmark is a leader in green innovation StatLink 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888934001654 1.3.4. Dependence on foreign trade is high, as is foreign aid Denmark has an open economy with high dependence on foreign trade. The transition to a low-carbon, circular economy is seen as an economic opportunity to boost exports of environmental technology and services, notably in energy technology. Clean tech has been the fastest-growing export sector in recent years, supported by Denmark’s international reputation as a front runner in green solutions and its strong framework of export promotion and assistance for internationalisation of innovation and commercial activities. Between 2003 and 2013, Denmark granted more export credits for renewables-based power generation projects than any other OECD country, thanks to strong support for wind energy. The government aims to double energy technology exports’ value to at least DKK 140 billion (EUR 19 billion) by 2030. Environment and climate change are well covered in Denmark’s official development assistance (ODA). Denmark is one of the few countries that has achieved the UN target of allocating at least 0.7% of gross national income to ODA. The ODA budget was, however, reduced in 2015, affecting environment- and climate-related development finance, which dropped by 44% between 2014 and 2017 in real terms (OECD, 2019[34]). At the same time, the focus has been on enhancing private sector engagement and mobilising private investment. For example, the Danish Climate Investment Fund has committed to support projects with Danish commercial participation and has attracted Danish institutional investors. While this is consistent with global efforts to enhance blended finance, these activities must not come at the expense of untied ODA. 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 Indexa Relative advantage in the specialisation of environmental technologies, 2002-05 and 2012-15 2012-15 2002-05 Note: Patent statistics are taken from the Worldwide Patent Statistical Database (PATSTAT) of the European Patent Office (EPO), with algorithms developed by the OECD.

Waste, materials management and the circular economy 1.4.1. Recycling and recovery rates are high, but so is municipal waste generation The Danish economy uses a lot of resources. In 2017, domestic material consumption per capita was about 24 tonnes, significantly higher than the averages per capita for OECD Europe (13 tonnes) and the OECD as a whole (16 tonnes). Domestic consumption of materials was decoupled from economic growth in 2008 and subsequent years, coinciding with the economic crisis. However, it has risen again since 2014. About half of national domestic consumption is non-metallic minerals and related to construction. Driven by large-scale infrastructure projects, construction activity is not expected to slow in coming years. The country is not performing well in terms of waste generation. Total waste generation rose by 30% between 2010 and 2016, to about 20 million tonnes. This increase reflects a rise in construction and demolition waste, which accounted for about 60% of total waste produced in 2016. Municipal waste generation has grown faster than private final consumption, but has been stable since the introduction of a new waste information system in 2010. In 2017, municipal waste generation per capita reached 785 kg, far exceeding the OECD average of 524 kg (Figure 10). Since 2007, Denmark has had the highest levels of municipal waste among OECD countries. Figure 10. Denmark’s municipal waste generation is the highest in the OECD StatLink 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888934001673 With regard to waste treatment, Denmark has nearly eliminated landfilling. Municipal waste landfilling fell from 5% to 1% between 2005 and 2017, mainly due to incineration with energy recovery. In addition, Denmark has achieved impressive results in material recovery of most waste streams. In 2016, it recovered 87% of construction and demolition waste, and recycled 73% of industrial waste, 74% of packaging waste and 89% of end-of-life vehicles. Household waste remains a notable exception. Incineration with energy recovery treated about half of municipal waste in 2017; the rest was recycled (27%) or composted (19%). The government estimates that it is on track to reach its goal of Source: OECD (2019), \"Municipal waste\", OECD Environmental Statistics (database). 0 200 400 600 800 1 000 kg/capita Municipal waste generation per capita, 2017 Municipal solid waste per capita Of which: household waste ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS  43 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 increasing the recycling share to 50% by 2022 for seven household waste fractions (plastic, paper, cardboard, glass, metal, wood, organic waste) considered jointly. Recycling increased from 22% in 2011 to 31% in 2016, the latest year for which figures are available. The cost of waste management services increased significantly over the review period and is now among the highest in OECD Europe. Total public expenditure (current and capital) on waste management increased by 17% between 2005 and 2016. Waste management costs have increased faster than municipal waste generation. 1.4.2. The policy and legal framework in waste management is well established but future organisation is uncertain Denmark has a strong policy and legal framework for waste and materials management. The main policies are defined in waste management plans and national strategies, such as Denmark without Waste: Recycle More, Incinerate Less (2013) and the circular economy strategy (2018). The main mandatory targets are derived almost exclusively from EU directives. The national regulatory framework includes a general framework law, the Environmental Protection Act, and a specific regulation, the Statutory Order on Waste. These are complemented by regulations on particular waste streams, treatment methods and specific policy aspects of waste management (waste monitoring, deposit-refund programmes). Denmark has a long history of stakeholder platforms and think tanks, with numerous councils, advisory boards and partnerships involving public authorities. The National Council on the Bio-economy brings together companies, industry associations and universities to promote development of new value chains. It is working on bio-based products, with a focus on plastics, textiles and construction. The advisory board on circular economy has prepared recommendations for the development of Denmark’s circular economy strategy. Partnerships involving industry, businesses and public authorities are set up for a wide range of practical issues related to national strategy implementation (e.g. on green public procurement, collection of waste electrical and electronic equipment [WEEE], sustainable construction, waste prevention, reduction of food waste). Denmark is well equipped to monitor trends in waste and material management through a robust information system. A waste data system, AffaldsDataSystemet (ADS), launched in 2010, has helped significantly improve data quality with an electronic register for waste collectors, consignees, exporters and importers. Pilot projects under way on material flow accounts, with detailed breakdowns by industry sectors and households, will be useful for enriching information to monitor the transition to a circular economy. Responsibility for waste management policies is shared between MEF for overall policy objectives (environmental aspects, promotion of recycling, etc.) and the Ministry of Climate, Energy and Utilities for economic regulation of the waste management sector and provision of waste management services. At the local level, the 98 municipalities have considerable autonomy in waste management planning. Since they are responsible for waste classification, they are largely free to decide on the treatment for a high proportion of total waste. As 82 municipalities own or co-own incineration plants and there is excess treatment capacity, there is a risk that they could be inclined to direct their waste to their incinerator. Municipal incinerators face no market incentives to compete on price, environmental performance or efficiency. Tipping fees range from around EUR 45 to EUR 96 per tonne of waste incinerated. Heavy public 44  ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 investment in municipal waste incineration has created dependence on steady deliveries of municipal waste and limited incentives for municipal investment in recycling and reuse. In addition, private companies and industrial sectors have complained that waste classification differs by municipality, resulting in additional administrative burdens for operators. What one municipality considers waste may not be classified as such in a neighbouring municipality. Waste classified as recyclable in one municipality may be considered suitable for incineration in another. This lack of harmonisation makes the playing field uneven for companies operating across municipal boundaries. The government’s 2016 Utilities for the Future strategy proposes an in-depth reorganisation of the waste management sector, with increased competition in incineration and a larger private-sector role in waste collection and recycling. However, discussions on practical implementation are stalled. This uncertainty about the future waste management framework discourages private and public investment in the circular economy. 1.4.3. A diverse policy mix encourages recycling despite incineration dependency, but more incentives are needed for waste prevention Denmark has been a front runner in diverting municipal waste from landfill. It effectively combines a ban on landfilling of waste that can be incinerated, in effect since 1997, with a landfill tax, the rate of which has been steadily raised. This policy mix also aims to promote energy recovery from waste. Several taxes apply to incineration: a tax based on the amount of heat produced (waste heating tax), an additional tax based on the energy content, a tax on CO2 emissions for non-biodegradable waste, and taxes on NOX and SOX emissions. Incineration taxes are designed to ensure a level playing field in the energy sector and internalise air pollution and carbon externalities; they also provide an incentive to divert waste towards recycling, although no recent analysis has been made of the impact of incineration taxation on recycling rates. Waste taxes were initially designed with a high rate for landfilling, a lower rate for incineration and no recycling tax, creating an incentive to recycle. The incineration tax was later redesigned to be closer to energy product taxes. The overall difference between incineration versus landfill taxation was kept the same so as to continue to encourage recycling. The Danish recycling market is characterised by small facilities recycling materials such as glass, wood, plastic, construction materials, WEEE, metals and textiles. Aside from glass packaging, however, most of Denmark’s recyclable waste is exported to recycling centres abroad, including cardboard, plastic, WEEE and treated wood. The fragmentation of recycling markets in Denmark hampers private investment, as does the lack of municipal harmonisation on sorting. Several municipalities apply volume- or weight-based pricing to unsorted residual household waste. The goal is to create an incentive to reduce waste and recycle more. However, despite the 2015 waste prevention strategy Denmark without Waste II, additional incentives are needed in view of the still high level of municipal waste generated. They are all the more necessary given municipal efforts to fulfil excess incineration capacity, which is not conducive to encouraging recycling and waste minimisation. Denmark has several extended producer responsibility programmes, in line with EU requirements (e.g. for WEEE, end-of-life vehicles, batteries). In most cases it exceeds the ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS  45 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 EU recycling targets. Collection of WEEE, however, remains a challenge, as in other OECD countries, as large quantities remain outside the official collection systems. In the construction sector, a tax on raw material extraction aims to promote rational use of resources. However, the rate (DKK 5/m3) is too low to prevent waste generation. In addition, many imported raw materials and non-taxed building materials are available. The weight-based landfill tax and possibility of recovering demolition waste without a permit (provided it is sorted, unpolluted and treated) favour recovery. Yet reuse of demolition waste, e.g. using concrete and crushed bricks instead of gravel in road repairs, often brings little added value. Several knowledge platforms and networks have been established in an effort to foster higher-quality recovery and selective demolition. 1.4.4. Denmark has reached a new political agreement to move towards a circular economy Denmark has long paved the way for circular economy approaches by promoting eco-design, clean production, eco-innovation and sustainable consumption. An EPA analysis in 2017 showed that almost 58% of the population pays attention to ecological or organic labels when they look for environment-friendly products. Fifteen partners from municipal, regional and central authorities joined forces to promote green public procurement with purchasing criteria including recyclability and recycled content. This partnership covers 20% of all Danish public procurement. Green public procurement is supported by mandatory purchasing rules for timber, energy-using products and road vehicles. In addition to product design, which must meet EU requirements, Denmark has introduced instruments to promote circular business models. These include information tools, such as dissemination of good practices (for example, a circular business web portal for SMEs), and financing instruments, e.g. providing support for eco-innovation. In October 2018, political agreement was reached on a circular economy, with a strong focus on how business can become its engine and how government can help (e.g. through one-stop shops, access to finance, digitalisation). The agreement recalls the objectives of the EU waste directives and notes the commitment of the private sector to increase resource productivity by 40% from 2014 to 2030 and to increase the recycling rate to 80% of total waste by 2030, in accordance with recommendations of the advisory board on circular economy. Large and small businesses are represented on the board, which the government established in 2016. Recommendations on waste, material management and the circular economy Reinforce waste prevention as a key priority  For household waste, expand pricing based on volume or weight – as in pay-as-you-throw programmes – while facilitating recycling and composting.  Accelerate R&D on sorting and recycling technology and innovative reusable and recyclable materials (e.g. biopolymers).  Develop policies to minimise output of single-use products, such as plastics. Foster competition in incineration and better manage excess capacity 46  ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019  Improve the cost-effectiveness of incineration by reforming municipal waste management, giving companies flexibility to choose where to incinerate their combustible waste and making public tenders mandatory for municipal waste incineration. Continue efforts to steer the transition to a circular economy  Harmonise criteria for sorting and collecting municipal waste fractions and consider unifying household and business recyclable waste markets to create economies of scale and encourage investment in innovation and large-scale recycling facilities.  Foster circular product design by introducing eco-modulation of fees in extended producer responsibility systems, based on recyclability, reparability and reusability.  Continue encouraging circular design by SMEs (e.g. through training and access to finance) and supporting companies in establishing take-back programmes and circular business models, e.g. with closed loops for products and materials.  Promote voluntary agreements between business and government on circular economy, ensuring that the objectives go beyond what is required by law.  Encourage voluntary initiatives and pilot projects to reduce “downcycling” (recycling that produces material of lesser quality and functionality than the original material) in the construction, textile and plastic sectors.  Secure financing to develop data for circular economy (e.g. green accounts and material flow information for industry sectors). 1.5. Chemicals management As a small country with few chemical producers, Denmark relies heavily on imports to meet domestic demand for chemicals. Chemical policy is therefore aimed primarily at ensuring that imported chemicals and imported consumer products containing them are safe for the environment and health. To this end, Denmark has developed a high level of expertise in chemical risk assessment, becoming an EU and international standard setter. The chemical policy framework derives largely from EU legislation, which Denmark has helped shape through its efforts to improve regulation of chemical use both nationally and internationally. There is good synergy and co-operation on policy implementation between public authorities, industry and civil society. Public health and environmental protection issues are at the heart of Denmark's chemicals management policy, which pays particular attention to substitution of hazardous chemicals. 1.5.1. Pressures on health and the environment from chemicals are monitored, yet remain significant Serious pressures from chemicals on health and the environment persist. A high prevalence of male reproductive disorders (40% of the male population have reduced semen quality) has been linked to exposure to certain chemicals, such as endocrine disrupters (EPA, 2013[35]). Groundwater contamination by pesticides remains a problem (Section 1). ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS  47 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Reducing production and use of chemicals harmful to the environment and health is a strategic objective of the 2014-17 and 2018-21 Chemical Initiatives. A comprehensive and long-standing monitoring system supports development of chemicals management policies. It includes the National Monitoring and Assessment Programme for the Aquatic and Terrestrial Environment, with dedicated programmes, e.g. for groundwater. There is also a pollutant release and transfer register (PRTR), though the number of installations it covers has decreased considerably since 2010. Danish research centres working on endocrine disruptor risk monitoring and prevention have developed biomonitoring programmes; increased public financial support would help fully exploit the centres’ potential (Bourguignon, Hutchinson and Slama, 2017[36]). Since 2001, the Danish Consumer Programme has conducted more than 160 surveys to identify chemicals in consumer products and assess their potential risks. More generally, allocation of public financial support to chemicals management implies handling trade-offs between monitoring of effects on health and the environment, on one hand, and predictive risk evaluation, on the other. The first relates to chemical use while the second refers to the process of identifying regulatory actions needed before a negative impact can be detected in humans or the environment. 1.5.2. Exemplary policy and institutional frameworks are coupled with stakeholder co-operation Multi-year policy documents known as Chemical Initiatives set Denmark’s national strategies, priorities and objectives for industrial chemicals management (Government of Denmark et al., 2017[37]). Negotiations between the government and political parties outside the government precede the adoption of these policy documents and guarantee a broad commitment (and resources) for their implementation. A first ex post evaluation of their effects was carried out in 2017 for the 2014-17 initiative (Sørensen et al., 2017[42]). Denmark should consider making such evaluation standard and improve indicators to track implementation progress. The current occupational health and safety strategy addresses chemicals marginally, which is surprising given, for instance, the important interface between EU industrial chemical and occupational health and safety legislation (Government of Denmark et al., 2011[39]). The prominence of industrial chemicals in the forthcoming strategy on occupational work and safety beyond 2020 should be enhanced. Denmark has a comprehensive regulatory framework that includes both EU and national instruments, with national rules sometimes going beyond the scope of EU regulations and directives (e.g. on provision of information on chemicals and on hazardous chemical installations). A process is under way to reduce Danish companies’ administrative burden, e.g. by avoiding going beyond EU requirements; it has affected the national regulatory framework by, for example, reducing the scope of reporting for the PRTR and green accounts. Nevertheless, Denmark has maintained the ambition of the Chemical Initiatives, whose 2018-21 budget is higher than that for 2014-17. Denmark remains a standard setter in many areas of chemical policy, including systematic investigation and risk management of chemicals, as evidenced by the high number of chemicals assessed and the country’s contribution to regulation and restriction of chemicals at the EU level, among others (Figure 11). It should continue to be proactive in developing chemicals management policies for the benefit of the Danish population and to influence European and other international decision makers. 48  ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Figure 11. Denmark is active in evaluation and risk management of chemicals at the EU level StatLink 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888934001692 For example, the Danish experience with pesticide taxation could inspire many other OECD countries. In 2013, the taxation in force since 1996 was changed from an ad valorem tax to a differentiated-weight tax based on the effects on health and the environment (Holtze, Hyldebrandt-Larsen and Kühl, 2018[40]). The new tax has four components: a basic tax, a health tax (with rates differing by health hazards), a tax on environmental toxicity (with rates differing by species) and a tax covering persistence, bioaccumulation and leaching. This design has proved effective: it has reduced the pesticide load (in terms of sales) by 40% from the 2011 level. To make it more acceptable, revenue is returned to farmers through a reduction in land taxes. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 DEU FRA ITA BEL DNK SWE NLD ESP AUT POL Substance evaluation under the Community rolling action plan, CoRAP, 2012-21a DEU 26% FRA 23% DNK 10% BEL 9% GBR 9% SWE 9% AUT 6% ITA 4% FIN 3% NOR 1% Endocrine disruptor assessement under the REACH and Biocidal Products Regulations, 2013-19 Selected countries and institutions involved in certain chemicals management activities 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 DEU DNK SWE FRA NLD ECHA AUT GBR IRL BEL Regulatory management option analysis, 2013-19b 0 5 10 15 20 25 ECHA SWE NOR FRA DNK DEU ITA NLD POL GBR Registry of restriction intentions, 2009-19c a) The list includes substances that have been evaluated or will be evaluated by 2021 (March 2019).

Formal and ad hoc inter-institutional co-ordination ensures stakeholder participation in policy development. Co-operation of public authorities, industry and other stakeholders has been exemplary and should be continued. Various forums, such as the Special Government Committee for the Environment (in which stakeholders are consulted ahead of EU or international discussion and decisions on chemicals) and the Danish Chemicals Forum, provide a platform for involvement in chemicals management. The public has access to a vast amount of data and information on chemicals. Many campaigns have been held to increase awareness of hazardous chemicals and chemical exposure among the general public and vulnerable populations (Denmark, 2018[41]; Sørensen et al., 2017[38]) The main enforcement authorities are the EPA, the Working Environment Authority and the Maritime Authority. The enforcement strategy is risk based. Since 2015, the enforcement activities of the three authorities in relation to the EU REACH regulation have been aligned with the strategy of the European Chemicals Agency Enforcement Forum. Enforcement in relation to chemicals in products (including imported articles and e-commerce) is a priority area for Denmark (Government of Denmark et al., 2017[37]), and a major challenge. In relation to the assessment work, a reduction in budget transferred to national authorities for their work under the EU REACH regulation is likely following the decrease in EU REACH registration fees. Testing of emergency response plans of hazardous installations has long been a problem (Amec Foster Wheeler, 2017[43]), but a new guideline to address it was issued in 2018. 1.5.3. The country has long been active in international forums and the regional setting Denmark has always been at the forefront of discussions on chemicals management at the global and regional levels and has given international co-operation an important place in national strategic documents. It continues to contribute actively to the work of international organisations involved in chemicals management, including the OECD, and to UN Environment’s Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM) (Denmark, 2018[41]). This leading role should be continued, e.g. in post-SAICM discussions. Co-operation within the EU has grown in line with the evolution of EU chemical legislation. Denmark also continues to play its part in the development of chemical policies in the Nordic, Arctic and Baltic Sea regions (Denmark, 2018[41]; Governments of Denmark, Greenland and the Faroe Islands, 2011[44]). 50  ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Recommendations on chemicals management Develop innovative tools to help decision making  Further expand risk-based monitoring of chemicals. For instance, enhance monitoring of legacy pesticides and their metabolites in groundwater and approved pesticides under the Pesticide Leaching Assessment Programme, and consider supplementing it with surface-water monitoring (relevant for biocides). Consider enhanced monitoring of emerging pollutants (e.g. pharmaceuticals in surface water and groundwater) and heavy metals (e.g. zinc in soil and water).  Strengthen biomonitoring to provide better evidence of people’s actual exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals and possible effects on human health to support policy making in this area; address trade-offs between monitoring and proactive identification of chemicals requiring regulatory action, taking into account the science-policy nexus (e.g. identification of exposure source).  Make assessment of the Chemical Initiatives’ effects a standard procedure and consider further development such as increasing the use of indicators to track implementation progress.  Make better use of PRTR data (e.g. for tracking trends in releases or benchmarking among companies). Implement and influence EU legislation  Continue identifying national priority areas for strengthened chemicals management and performing an active role at the EU level in identifying chemicals of concern (including the need for substitutes) and assessment of chemicals, including predictive risk assessment (e.g. in relation to endocrine-disrupting chemicals and quantitative structure-activity relationships) and risk management.  Assess implications of the coming reduction in REACH registration fees on activities that the fees are intended to support in Denmark.  Strengthen efforts at the national and international levels on compliance assurance for high-risk chemicals in products (including imports and e-commerce), for instance through enhanced co-operation with customs.  Assess the effectiveness of new measures to strengthen emergency response for the most hazardous facilities (covered by the EU Seveso III Directive).

[31] ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS  55 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Annex 1.A. Actions taken to implement recommendations from the 2007 OECD Environmental Performance Review of Denmark Recommendations Actions taken Environmental performance: Trends and recent developments Continue to improve energy efficiency (e.g. transport and building sectors, public sector, distribution companies). Review energy taxation to establish appropriate price signals. Political agreements from 2012 and 2016 oblige grid companies (including electricity, district heating and gas distribution companies), which provide energy directly to retail consumers, to report a certain amount of energy savings annually. Other actions taken to improve energy efficiency include a Knowledge Centre for Energy Savings in Buildings, more stringent requirements for energy efficiency in government buildings and a requirement for energy consumption in new construction to be reduced by 75% in 2020 compared with 2006 figures. An evaluation of energy taxation and energy subsidies (feed-in premiums, feed-in tariffs, contracts for difference to off-shore wind farms, fixed yearly subsidies and one-off investment support) was performed, and as a result, it was decided to lower electricity taxation to make electric heating and electric cars more attractive vis-à-vis fossil-fuel-based solutions. Electricity taxes for industry were reduced, widening the gaps in energy prices across users. Ensure that cost-effective domestic measures will contribute to meet the Kyoto Protocol’s greenhouse gas emission reduction target, especially in sectors not covered by the EU Emission Trading Scheme. Accelerate afforestation. Covered by the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the energy sector delivered most domestic greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions. Measures have also been taken for sectors outside the EU ETS. In particular, fuel efficiency has been added as a criterion for setting the level of the vehicle registration tax and the annual vehicle tax; public financial support has been provided for the conversion of farmed peatland into natural areas, biological coverage of old landfills and afforestation. Assess and reduce disparities in exposure to pollution. In 2019, the Environmental Economic Council assessed disparities in exposure to PM2,5 and NO2 pollution. It found that income inequality played a limited role in explaining disparities in exposure to air pollution in Denmark. Continue to reduce emissions of NOx and VOCs from mobile sources, including through the use of economic instruments in the most cost-effective way. Taxes on NOX were introduced on road fuels (DKK 5.2 per kg in 2019) and for vehicles without a particle filter, via the annual vehicle tax (DKK 1 000 in 2019). The countervailing charge on diesel vehicles was raised. Strengthen the management of particulate matter, including the monitoring of PM10 and PM2,5 concentrations and emissions. Develop emission standards for residential wood burning stoves. Implement and enforce low emission zones in cities. Emission standards for new residential wood-burning stoves were introduced in 2008. In 2015, it was decided to strengthen the emission values. In 2019, Denmark introduced a scrapping programme for wood-burning stoves produced before 1995. The Environmental Protection Agency has conducted information campaigns on proper wood burning. The eco-innovation programme supports R&D for technologies that reduce air pollution from wood stoves and boilers. Low-emission zones were introduced in 2010 in the four largest cities. In 2019, the rules were tightened, so that diesel trucks, buses and vans will gradually be required to either meet Euro VI emission standards or have a particle filter to circulate in low-emission zones. Continue to encourage the provision of economically and environmentally attractive public transport systems in urban areas. Strengthen transport demand management to limit passenger car use in congested areas. Implement the Bicycle Strategy 2007. Address air pollutant emissions from ships. It was decided to build tram networks in Copenhagen, Aarhus and Odense. The Bicycle Strategy 2007 was implemented, and a new strategy was adopted in 2014. New international regulations and enhanced national surveillance have reduced sulphur air pollution caused by international shipping. Denmark passed legislation to make public certain violations of the sulphur act. Integrate transport and environmental policies. Set quantitative targets, further use demand-side management, and facilitate co-operation among state and territorial authorities and concerned parties. A number of transport enterprises and municipalities set voluntary short-term CO2 reduction targets as part of a green certification programme. Since 2012, the mandate to blend biofuels in road fuels has been raised to 5.75%. In 2018, Denmark expressed an intention to phase out sales of fossil fuel cars by 2030 and plug-in hybrid cars by 2035. Develop a sustainable transport plan as a follow-up to the forthcoming national sustainable development strategy. Denmark launched a sustainable transport plan in 2008. The following year, a green transport policy agreement was concluded, allocating DKK 57 billion to public transport investment. Speed up identification of areas at high risk of nutrient and pesticide contamination and take measures to protect them, including establishing groundwater protection zones, 10-metre buffer zones along rivers, and buffer zones around lakes. Groundwater mapping identified 7 000 km2 of nitrate- and pesticide-sensitive areas. A ban on spraying pesticides, fertilising and cultivating soils in a 25-meter zone around drinking water boreholes has been introduced; in 2019, Denmark aimed to extend the protection zone. Buffer zones of 9 meters along rivers and lakes were removed in 2015 and replaced by nitrogen regulation targeting coastal waters threatened with eutrophication. The first part of targeted regulation, targeted catch crops, was introduced in 2017. Differentiation of farmers’ nitrogen quotas began in 2019. 56  ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Reinforce the interface between water management and nature protection, in the wake of local government reform and pursuant to Action Plan for the Aquatic Environment III objectives. In particular, speed up creation of new wetlands and define ecological quality objectives for rivers. Aquatic Action Plans and subsequent River Basin Management Plans (RBMPs) have led to the establishment of new wetlands. RBMPs set ecological quality objectives for all rivers, lakes and coastal waters. In 2018, a Multifunctional Land Redistribution Fund was established to foster the protection of nature and water on farmland. Move toward river basin management according to the new water districts. In particular, prepare water plans as required by the EU Water Framework Directive. Denmark prepared and implemented RBMPs for 2009-15 and 2015-21. Establish national parks in priority conservation areas and clarify their role in relation to other protected areas. Complete management plans for all protected areas including the Natura 2000 areas, incorporating biodiversity objectives and ecological integrity indicators, and establish a network of corridors linking them. Develop and adopt ecosystem quality objectives for terrestrial and aquatic habitats, including as part of implementation of the EU Habitats and Water Framework Directives. Five national parks were established by assignment agreements, managed at the local level. They impose regulation on specific activities by designating various planning zones. Natura 2000 plans for 2010-15 and 2016-21 were adopted, including detailed biodiversity objectives. All 252 Natura 2000 areas have their own management plan. A basis for a network of biodiversity corridors was established with the Green Map of Denmark. Quality objectives for terrestrial and aquatic habitats were developed in the Natura 2000 Plans and the RBMPs. Develop time-bound objectives for the national nature and biodiversity conservation action plan, including with regard to integration of biodiversity considerations in agriculture, fisheries and other sectoral policies. Develop and implement a comprehensive planning system, with a sea use planning component and with cumulative impact assessment and climate change impact scenarios. The headline objective of Denmark’s 2014 biodiversity plan was to stop biodiversity loss by 2020.According to Denmark’s sixth report to the Convention on Biological Diversity in 2019, ambitious new goals for nature should guide the development of a new National Strategy for Biodiversity. Involving farmers in biodiversity promotion is a goal of both the 2014 biodiversity strategy and the 2016 Nature Package. Denmark regulates reef fisheries in Natura 2000 areas. A law on maritime spatial planning integrating environmental protection with planning for economic activities at sea, such as offshore energy, fisheries and raw material extraction, entered into force in 2016. Expand restoration projects for major ecosystems, including major rivers and future national parks, to re-establish their capacity to produce ecological services and to support biodiversity. Action was taken to restore watercourses, including by re-establishing naturally meandering courses; EUR 85 million was allocated to watercourse restoration in the RBMP for 2015-21. Include the public health benefits of access to nature and outdoor recreation as an integral part of national environment and health action plans. Public health benefits of access to nature and outdoor recreation were included in plans on physical activity and mental health prepared by the Ministry of Health in 2012, and in the political agreement on a Nature Package in 2016. Place higher priority on marine protection, including marine ecosystem protection. Take further steps to reduce the discharge of toxic substances and nutrients. Ensure that Denmark’s international commitments are achieved. Denmark designated more Natura 2000 areas at sea. The Danish offshore oil and gas industry reduced releases of oil and chemicals to the North Sea. Nitrogen discharges to coastal waters were reduced by around 10% from 2005-07 to 2013-15, in accordance with Denmark's commitments under the Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea Area. Pursue efforts towards the sustainable management of commercial fisheries and aquaculture. The sustainability of commercial fisheries improved, but some fish stocks are still overexploited, especially in the Baltic Sea. More than 80% of Danish fishing is certified by the Marine Stewardship Council. A 2014-20 aquaculture strategy aims at making the sector more sustainable. Continue efforts to ensure appropriate implementation of multilateral environmental agreements involving trade (ozone-depleting substances, hazardous substances, chemicals, endangered species). Denmark worked actively for appropriate implementation of multilateral environmental agreements at national, EU and international level. It contributed financially to the multilateral fund of the Montreal Protocol and to the Basel Convention Trust Fund. In 2019, Denmark issued a new statutory order on the national implementation of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Accelerate the ratification of international environmental agreements already signed. Denmark ratified a number of international agreements, e.g. the Minamata Convention (mercury), the Hong Kong Convention (ship recycling), the Nagoya Protocol (genetic resources) to the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Gothenburg Protocol (acidification, eutrophication and ground-level ozone) to the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution. ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS  57 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Environmental governance and management Further develop the environmental strategic and planning framework with specific environmental quality objectives as well as targets and deadlines, in the context of the sustainable development strategy. Pursue efforts to use cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analyses in policy setting and implementation. The national sustainable development strategy (2014) includes seven specific and time-bound environmental targets. The 2017 Action Plan on the Implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals includes ten environmental targets; those of a general nature still include specific indicators. Denmark uses cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis extensively. Regulatory impact assessment has to cover environmental impacts. Continue to make use of cost-benefit analysis and economic valuation in environmental health policy making; and derive relevant priorities for action. Cost-benefit analysis was used actively, e.g. when deciding to tighten regulations on low-emission zones in cities to limit air pollution. The average adult value of statistical life was raised from EUR 2.5 million to EUR 4.1 million, which is high by OECD standards. Set up capacity building mechanisms to help municipalities carry out new environmental management tasks resulting from the territorial government reform. Foster exchange of expertise among municipalities. The national level helped build capacity and foster exchange of expertise among municipalities through a number of task forces dedicated to various environmental management tasks. Prioritise monitoring of national environmental action plans. Denmark prioritised monitoring of national environmental action plans in its National Monitoring and Assessment Programme for the Aquatic and Terrestrial Environment (NOVANA). Carry out a comprehensive assessment of the economic efficiency and environmental effectiveness of water pollution abatement measures in different sectors (municipal, industrial, agricultural), in the context of implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive. Comprehensive cost-effectiveness assessments of pollution abatement measures in the agriculture, municipal and industrial sectors were carried out in preparation of the Aquatic Actions Plans and RBMPs. Accelerate the rate of environmental certification of fish farms. A 2016 Growth Plan for Aquaculture seeks to modernise the fish farm sector with incentives to change to sustainable production methods. In 2019, 26 of the 166 fish farms were certified by the Aquaculture Stewardship Council. Continue to promote environmental democracy through access to environmental information, public participation, and access to courts for citizens and associations (e.g. environmental NGOs). The 2017 amendment to the Environmental Information Act (2000), which transposes the Aarhus Convention, aims to improve access to environmental information through better information on the state of the environment (the next quadrennial report on the state of the environment is planned for 2019). Civil society stakeholders are actively involved in policy making, e.g. through advisory boards, including in the preparation of primary legislation. Processing times for complaints against decisions of public authorities were lowered. Towards green growth Continue to rely on and, where relevant, expand the use of environmental taxes to internalise externalities. Adjust tax rates for inflation. Reduce tax concessions and the associated administrative cost of their implementation. A number of environmental taxes were introduced or adjusted to better reflect externalities. In particular, Denmark has increased and harmonised the CO2 tax (EUR 23/t CO2 in 2018 for most users), introduced a NOX tax in 2010 and reformed the pesticide tax in 2013 to align it more closely on environmental and health externalities. The energy duty and taxes on NOX, CO2 and SOX were adjusted annually to a consumer price index. Industry continues to enjoy sizeable environmental tax concessions. Adopt a national action plan for promoting environmental technology based on appropriate economic analysis, and implement it. In 2009, Denmark adopted an action plan to promote environmental technology. Steps have been taken in development and demonstration, export promotion, sector-specific growth plans and industry partnerships on air and water technologies. Consider the further use of economic instruments to address diffuse pollution. Target fiscal incentives to environmental outcomes and improve cost-effectiveness. Direct payments to farmers to reduce diffuse water pollution as part of the Rural Development Programme (RDP) increased from EUR 27 million in 2015 to EUR 82 million in 2019. A targeted nitrogen regulation, initiated in 2017, allows geographically differentiated regulation (depending on the risk of eutrophication in downstream coastal waters) to improve cost-effectiveness. Increase the efficiency of public water supply and waste water management, in particular by exploiting economies of scale in the wake of local government reform and pursuant to the proposed water reform objectives. Water utilities have improved their efficiency since the introduction of tariff regulation (the introduction of a ceiling for user charges) in 2017. The amendment of the Water Sector Act (2009) in 2017 also set operating costs requirements based on benchmarking. Adjust the levels of economic incentives and revise the land use legal framework, so as to enhance biodiversity conservation, production of ecological services (e.g. reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus leaching) and groundwater protection (e.g. in priority contaminated areas) on private land. Under the RDP, Denmark provides financial support to landowners for the reduction of water pollution and, to a lesser extent, for the protection of biodiversity. Support rates should not exceed costs and income foregone. The Green Map of Denmark was introduced in 2017 to strengthen biodiversity protection in municipal spatial planning. Continue to examine the existing support schemes from the point of view of their environmental effectiveness and economic efficiency. Financial support for renewable energy was subject to a major evaluation exercise in order to propose support levels better aligned with electricity market prices. In 2014, the EU Agricultural Fund for Rural Development assessed the Danish RDP support programmes in terms of environmental effectiveness. Denmark assessed the 58  ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 cost-effectiveness of environmental technologies in the framework of the Energy Technology Development and Demonstration Programme and the Danish Eco-innovation Programme. Review existing transport taxes with a view to restructuring them in a more environmentally friendly way (e.g. taxing both car use and ownership; removing the tax break for commuting). Consider the introduction of road pricing as a means to halt congestion. Denmark lowered its high vehicle registration tax, and strengthened requirements for discounts for fuel-efficient vehicles. In 2012, the project to introduce a congestion charge in Copenhagen was abandoned and replaced by a political agreement to lower the price of public transport by EUR 67 million and to invest an additional EUR 67 million yearly in public transport. The excise tax on diesel fuel used as road fuel continues to be lower than the excise duty on gasoline. Denmark considers this differential tax rate to be a tax expenditure. A compensatory fee (countervailing charge) has been applied to certain diesel vehicles since 2017. Continue to play an exemplary role in international environmental protection including through development aid. Continue to contribute to sustainable development and capacity building in developing countries through environmental technology exports and other measures (e.g. support for environmental education and awareness programmes). Denmark reduced official development assistance (ODA) going to environmental projects as part of a general reduction of ODA towards the United Nations target of 0.7% of GNI. At the same time, it has strengthened technical co-operation among governments and increased private sector participation to mobilise private investment for sustainable development projects through the Investment Fund for Developing Countries (established in 1967). Waste, materials management and the circular economy Step up efforts to promote more sustainable consumption patterns (e.g. concerning waste, transportation, land use) by adopting appropriate regulatory and economic instruments, and by focusing on demand management. Denmark has increased the recycling of household waste and aims to bring added value to construction waste (e.g. reusing bricks in construction rather than crushing them for use as road materials). Despite some initiatives on waste prevention, in particular related to food waste, municipal waste generation per capita is still the highest in the OECD. Denmark supports the transition to a circular economy through green public procurement, eco-labelling and facilitating SME access to information, demonstration project grants and blended finance. The continuation of the long-established “Five Finger Plan” contributes to the coherence of urban development and urban transport planning in the Copenhagen area. Continue efforts towards appropriate dismantling of Danish end-of-life ships. Denmark has supported international efforts to promote ship dismantling by ratifying the Hong Kong Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships (which has yet to enter into force) and implementing Regulation 1257/2013 of the EU on ship recycling. Chemicals management Set up additional targets concerning environmental factors related to health with related indicators. Continue to understand better through research and studies the potential links between environmental pollution and chronic illness or child health issues. Take action where there is knowledge (e.g. particulate pollution). In 2013 Denmark set a target of reducing the pesticide load by 40% from the 2011 level in terms of sales by 2015. A 2016 evaluation showed that the target had been met since 2014. Support for research on the health impacts of environmental factors was continued, e.g. under the Centre for Endocrine Disrupting Substances, the National Allergy Research Centre and via biomonitoring. The results were used to support further action under the EU Regulation on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). Agreements called Chemical Initiatives are important policy frameworks, targeting children and other vulnerable groups. For instance an evaluation was performed of total exposure of children to selected substances that are hormone disruptive, suspected hormone disruptive or neurotoxic. Among other things, Danish research led to EU-level restrictions on the use of phthalates in 2018. I.

Environmental performance: Trends and recent developments Denmark has made visible progress in decoupling environmental pressures from economic activity. Yet the country is still facing a number of environmental pressures that create challenges on its path towards green growth and sustainable development. This chapter provides a snapshot of key environmental trends in Denmark. It presents the main economic and social developments and the country’s progress in making the transition to an energy-efficient, low-carbon and resource-efficient economy and in managing the natural asset base. The chapter also summarises key policy developments in specific areas, including energy, climate, air, biodiversity and water.

ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE: TRENDS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 1.1. Introduction Denmark1 has a small open economy with gross domestic product (GDP) per capita well above the OECD average and income inequality among the lowest in the OECD. Its population enjoys a very high living standard and life satisfaction. On the environmental front, Denmark decoupled greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from economic growth over the review period (since 2005). It also made impressive progress towards decarbonising its energy sector: its energy intensity and carbon intensity are among the lowest for any International Energy Agency country. Denmark is a top performer in the share of wind power in electricity generation (IEA, 2017[1]). Yet it still faces a number of environmental pressures. Danish citizens remain exposed to levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) above World Health Organization standards and the country is struggling to meet its target of reducing ammonia emissions under EU legislation. Biodiversity is strained in many regions, reflecting a large number of red-listed species, a poor state of conservation of natural habitats and low connectivity of ecosystems. Water quality needs to be improved, especially with regard to the presence of pesticides in groundwater and the ecological status of rivers, lakes and coastal waters. This chapter provides an overview of Denmark’s main environmental achievements and challenges on its path towards green growth and sustainable development. Drawing on indicators from national and international sources, it reviews progress on national policy goals and on international commitments and targets, focusing on the period since 2005. To the extent possible, it compares the state of the environment and key environmental trends with those of other OECD countries. The chapter sketches out major policy developments in environmental sectors including air, climate, biodiversity and water. 1.1.1. Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals Denmark co-chaired the 2015 UN Sustainable Development Summit that adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In 2017, the Danish government approved an action plan that translates the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into five priority areas: prosperity, people, planet, peace and partnerships. The action plan contains national targets and indicators to monitor progress in achieving them. A first annual progress report was published in 2018 and a more comprehensive status report will be prepared every four years (MF, 2017[2]). Relative to the OECD average, Denmark outperforms on most SDGs. It has already met 26 of the 94 SDG targets for which indicators are available, and the distance to target is small for most others (OECD, 2018[3]). However, as in other Nordic countries, key challenges on the road to 2030 are linked to the greening of agricultural systems, material consumption levels and ecosystem conservation (Larsen and Alslund-Lanthén, 2017[4]). 1.2. Main economic and social developments 1.2.1. Economic performance Denmark has a rich and open economy. It ranks eighth among OECD countries for GDP per capita and maintains a large trade surplus (MEAI, 2018[5]). However, over 2005-18, GDP growth was below the OECD average (Figure 1.1) and the GDP per capita gap fell from 26% to 18% (OECD, 2018[6]). GDP per capita returned to pre-2008 economic crisis levels only in 2016 (OECD, 2019[7]). GDP growth is projected to decelerate to 1.9% in I.1. ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE: TRENDS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  63 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 2019 and 1.6% in 2020. In terms of financial balance, Denmark has not returned to pre-crisis conditions (5% of GDP surplus) but is gradually returning to equilibrium, although a slight deficit is expected in 2020 and 2021 (OECD, 2018[8]). The 2019 OECD Economic Survey points to the need to boost productivity growth, adapt to the challenges posed by new technology and improve the efficiency of the public sector (OECD, 2019[7]). Figure 1.1. GDP per capita remains high, but GDP growth lags behind the OECD level StatLink 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888934001711 1.2.2. Structure of the economy and employment The economy is dominated by the service sector, which accounted for three-quarters of value added in 2017, above the OECD average; industry accounted for most of the rest (Figure 1.2). The shares of imports and exports of goods and services in GDP, respectively 49% and 55%, are in line with the OECD averages. Machinery and transport equipment is the main export sector, followed by chemicals and related products (including pharmaceuticals) and the food and live animal sectors. The main recipients of Danish products are Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom (OECD, 2019[7]). General government expenditure reached about 51% of GDP in 2017, the fourth highest share in the OECD after France, Finland and Belgium (OECD, 2019[9]). Social spending is among the highest in the OECD (OECD, 2018[10]). Danes enjoy working hours below the OECD average, and income inequality (as measured by the Gini coefficient) remains among the lowest in the OECD (OECD, 2019[11]; OECD, 2017[12]). The employment rate was high at 74.2% in 2017, compared with the OECD average of 67.8%. Sustained employment growth in the private sector brought the unemployment rate down to 5.7% in 2017; the rate is expected to fall to 4.9% in 2020 (OECD, 2019[7]).

Population, well-being and quality of life Over 2005-18, the population increased little but steadily from 5.4 million to almost 5.8 million (SD, 2018[13]). In 2015, there were on average 33 people of retirement age (aged 65 and over) per 100 working-age people (aged 20 to 64), compared to the OECD average of 28%. By 2050, the ratio is expected to reach 45% in Denmark (compared to 53% in the OECD), leading to increased public spending on health, long-term care and pensions (OECD, 2019[14]). Denmark is addressing this challenge in its pension system and public finances by, for instance, linking retirement age to life expectancy (OECD, 2019[7]). The health care system is highly accessible (unmet need for medical care due to financial or geographic reasons is low) and appears to allocate and use its resources efficiently, e.g. reductions in the number of acute-care beds were offset by non-acute-care sectors (OECD/EOHSP, 2017[15]). Cancer is one of the biggest challenges. Denmark has the fourth highest mortality rate in the EU, with cancer accounting for 29% of all deaths among women and 32% among men in 2014 (OECD/EOHSP, 2017[15]). Denmark is consistently among the top ten countries ranked in terms of happiness indicators, along with other Nordic countries (Finland, Iceland, Sweden and Norway) (Helliwell, Layard and Sachs, 2018[16]), and performs well in various dimensions of well-being (Figure 1.3) (OECD, 2017[17]). Over 80% of the population consider themselves well informed on environmental issues. Danes are particularly concerned about air and water pollution, chemicals in everyday products, and water scarcity, but are less worried than people in many other EU countries about the growing amount of waste (EC, 2014[18]).

The 2012 Energy Agreement set the framework for 2012-20 and the 2018 Energy Agreement for 2020-24. Both support Denmark’s long-term goal of becoming a carbon-neutral society by 2050, a goal first set in 2011 in the Energy Strategy 2050.

Denmark also committed to phase out electricity production from coal by 2030 (Table 1.1). The 2018 Energy Agreement is a key step for Denmark to meet its 2050 target. Prior to this, the Danish Energy Agency estimated that without additional policies, the share of renewables would stagnate and fossil fuel consumption and GHG emissions increase after 2020 (EA, 2017[19]).

Source: (MCEB, 2012[20]; Government of Denmark et al., 2018[21]). The 2018 Energy Agreement includes ten priorities, with several initiatives for each. The agreement largely builds on the 2017 recommendations made by an independent energy commission (DEnC, 2017[22]). It proposes, for instance, increasing flexibility of the energy system, removing restrictions on production in the form of combined heat and power (CHP) requirements, implementing market-based and technology neutral solutions, phasing out subsidies (except for existing CHP plants) and pursuing international co-operation. It has a strong focus on cost-effectiveness (OECD, 2019[7]). Under the agreement, technology-neutral one-off investment grants will replace feed-in tariffs in a move to solutions that are more responsive to changing market conditions. Some EUR 560 million is to be allocated for this purpose from the state budget for 2020-24 (Chapter 3). Implementing tools such as the policy, regulatory and analytical framework will complement the agreement to contextualise certain initiatives on renewables and energy efficiency, including the gas strategy, a new energy savings programme and the building renovation strategy. The EU will need to approve some initiatives under its state aid rules. A special reserve is planned under the agreement for additional actions as of 2025 (MCEB, 2012[20]; Government of Denmark et al., 2018[21]). The 2018 Energy Agreement does not clarify how Denmark plans to cope with the energy need and associated environmental impact of data centres under construction, which will contribute to growing energy demand, while coal is to be phased out. It is estimated that their projected electricity consumption will account for 21% of total electricity consumption in 2030 and 35% in 2040 (EA, 2018[23]). Finally, the 2018 agreement reconfirms continued extensive oil and gas extraction in the North Sea, although Denmark also announced in 2018 that there would be no onshore oil, gas and shale gas exploration (Government of Denmark et al., 2018[21]).

Renewables (mainly biofuels, waste and wind) rose in significance in energy supply and power generation over the review period (Figure 1.7). The 2010-20 National Renewable Energy Action Plan, implementing the relevant EU directive, set a target of 30% of renewables in gross final consumption by 2020 (the sixth highest target in the EU). Sectoral targets complemented the national target: 39.8% for heating and cooling, 51.9% for electricity and 10.1% for transport in 2020 (MEC, 2010[25]; MCEB, 2012[20]). In 2018, the EU agreed that Denmark’s binding renewables target for 2030 was 32%. All EU countries must prepare ten-year integrated national energy and climate plans with national targets, contributions, policies and measures by 31 December 2019 (European Parliament, 2018[26]). Over 2005-17, Denmark more than doubled the share of renewables in TPES, from 15% to 35% (IEA, 2018[24]). It also met its target of 30% renewables in gross final energy consumption before the 2020 deadline, and is on track to meet its 50% target for wind energy in domestic electricity supply for 2020 and 90% for renewables in district heating by 2030 (EA, 2018[27]). Achieving the target of 10% renewable sources in transport fuels by 2020, as required by the EU Renewable Energy Directive, would require strengthening the biofuel blending mandate. Negotiations are taking place in Denmark on this issue, as relying on the 2018 Energy Agreement would lead to an 8.7% share (Climate Council, 2018[28]; Eurostat, 2019[29]; Denmark, 2019[30]). a) Total primary energy supply (TPES).

Renewables, chiefly biofuels and wind, have been gaining significance in energy supply, particularly in power generation StatLink 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888934001806 Electricity generation has changed fundamentally over the past two decades, with wind and bioenergy (Figure 1.7) having largely superseded coal. Supported by its flexible domestic power system and high level of interconnection, Denmark is now widely recognised as a global leader in integrating variable renewables in its electricity system while maintaining a highly reliable and secure power grid (IEA, 2017[1]). With the share of wind energy in the electricity supply at over 40% in 2017, Denmark is on the way to meeting its 2020 target of 50% of electricity from wind power, and is among the top five countries for wind in electricity generation (REN21, 2018[31]; IEA, 2018[24]). Denmark imports over 40% of the solid biomass it uses for energy purposes, more than any other OECD country (Figure 1.7). The use of wood pellets increased by 187% between 2006 and 2016, and the share of imports was 94% in 2016 (Ea Energianalyse, 2017[32]). The dominant role of bioenergy in the renewables mix raises the issue of environmental sustainability of supply (OECD, 2019[33]), as only documented CO2-neutral biomass should be counted as a renewable and favourable treatment should be ended (Chapter 3). In addition, increasing use of biomass in the heating sector contributes to emissions of air pollutants, including PM2.5, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), black carbon and dioxins (IEA, Source: IEA (2018), IEA World Energy Statistics and Balances (database).\n88% 53% 40% 39% 39% 35% 33% 30% 26% 22% 100% 98% 73% 82% 58% 71% 46% 75% 44% 63% 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Iceland Norway Latvia New Zealand Sweden Denmark Finland Austria Chile Switzerland Renewable energy sources in total primary energy supply (TPES) and power generation, top ten OECD countries, 2017 Share of renewable energy sources in TPES Share of renewable energy sources in electricity generation 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 2005 2017 2005 2017 Denmark OECD Renewable energy supply mix in Denmark and in the OECD, 2005 and 2017 Municipal waste Primary solid biofuels Biofuels Hydro Geothermal Solar, tide, wave, ocean Wind 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% Denmark Luxembourg United Kingdom Belgium Italy Share of imports of solid biomass in primary energy suply, top five OECD countries, 2017 70  I.1.

To address such concerns, the Danish industry introduced voluntary sustainability criteria in 2014-15 (Brack, Hewitt and Marchand, 2018[35]). 1.3.2. Transport The transport sector is the second highest energy consumer (road transport accounts for about three-quarters of energy consumption in the sector) and GHG emitter. Despite well-developed infrastructure, Denmark has one of the lowest shares of rail in inland freight transport in the EU (Eurostat, 2018[36]; ITF, 2018[37]). In 2014, the main message on infrastructure of the Danish Productivity Commission was to expand user payments to reduce congestion (Productivity Commission, 2014[38]). The number of passenger cars per inhabitant is still below the OECD average, but increased from 35 to 44 vehicles per 100 persons between 2005 and 2018. The share of diesel cars in the total passenger car fleet rose from 10% in 2005 to 31% in 2017 (RD, 2018[39]). The growth trend in the number of personal cars is expected to continue, in line with reductions in the existing heavy tax burden (e.g. registration tax) (Chapter 3). Although energy-related CO2 emissions in transport have declined over the last decade (Figure 1.8), the pace has been slower than in the energy sector. Denmark bases its climate policy on cost-effectiveness and impact on the competitiveness of the sectors. Reducing emissions in the energy sector, which is partly shielded from international competition, has proved to be the least costly solution. Fewer cost-effective options have been identified in transport and agriculture, as is the case for almost all OECD countries. By 2020, emissions in the sectors not covered by the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), particularly transport, are expected to represent around 70% of overall GHG emissions (MEUC, 2017[40]). Moreover, before new initiatives were proposed under the 2018 Energy Agreement and the climate and air proposal (Section 1.3.3), the Danish government had projected that fossil fuels would still account for over 93% of transport-related energy consumption in 2030 (compared to 95% now). Decreased dependence on fossil fuels in the transport sector thus requires sustained efforts (EA, 2018[41]). Figure 1.8.

ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE: TRENDS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  71 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Zero-emission vehicles are considered to have great potential for supporting Denmark’s goal of becoming a carbon-neutral society by 2050 (Sørensen et al., 2017[42]). The government’s 2018 climate and air proposal is an important step in reaching this goal. It aims to halt sales of new diesel and gasoline vehicles by 2030 and hybrids by 2035. The proposal includes incentives for green vehicles, such as investment in high-speed charging stations for electric vehicles (EVs), tax incentives for green company cars (Chapter 3), cheaper car parks with priority for green vehicles, and permission for green vehicles to drive in bus lanes (Danish Government, 2018[43]). Electric and hybrid cars costing less than DKK 400 000 (EUR 54 000) are exempt from registration tax in 2019 and 2020 (MF, 2018[44]). The increase in Danish renewables production should support the spread of clean vehicles, although reaching 1 million EVs and plug-in hybrids by 2030 (a potential outcome of the incentives) may be costly (OECD, 2019[7]). While electrification of the main Danish rail lines is ongoing, it has fallen behind execution of the 2014 Danish flagship project in the rail transport area, Train Fund DK, which has been limited from its original scope (MF, 2017[45]). The project aimed at upgrading the Danish railways by building new lines, upgrading existing lines and electrifying major lines (MTBH, 2014[46]) to reduce travel times and support environmental objectives, for instance by switching from diesel to electric trains. 1.3.3. Climate change mitigation and adaptation Main policies and measures Danish policy on climate comprises national goals and efforts combined with international and EU obligations. The main Danish policy documents making up the current framework include the 2008 Danish Strategy for Adaptation to a Changing Climate (an Action Plan for a Climate-proof Denmark followed in 2012), the 2012 Energy Agreement for 2012-20, the 2018 Energy Agreement for 2020-24 and the 2018 climate and air proposal. The Climate Act regulated the preparation of an annual government climate report to Parliament, outlined the process of setting national climate targets and established an independent, expert-based Climate Council (MEUC, 2017[40]), with six members appointed for four years by the relevant minister. The government presented the climate and air proposal in October 2018, outlining measures to reduce GHG emissions and air pollutants in non-EU ETS sectors up to 2030, on the assumption that these closely linked issues needed synergistic measures. The proposal supports the 2050 goal of a carbon-neutral society and sets out 38 activities. It announced the phase-out of sales of new diesel and gasoline cars by 2030 and hybrids by 2035 (the aim is to have 1 million EVs and plug-in hybrids by 2030), as well as measures on the greening of public transport; environment-friendly shipping; agriculture (e.g. EUR 12 million for research and development [R&D] on low-GHG farming and EUR 14 million for carbon capture and storage [CCS] in Danish farmland and forests); and greener buildings and businesses (Danish Government, 2018[43]). The government has completed or initiated implementation of the majority of initiatives proposed under the climate and air proposal (e.g. via the Finance Act for 2019). These include a larger premium for scrapping old diesel cars and grants for investment in low-carbon technology regarding barns or CCS research (Denmark, 2019[30]). Transforming the proposal into actions in agriculture and transport, which is key for Danish non-EU ETS reduction commitments, is under way (e.g. a consultative committee was established in February 2019). The OECD recommended that Denmark first implement the most 72  I.1. ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE: TRENDS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 cost-effective emission reduction measures, in agriculture (OECD, 2019[7]). The country should benefit from securing a broad political commitment for its climate and air initiatives. During the review period, Denmark’s climate policy focused on meeting international GHG emission reduction targets in the first (2008-12) and second (2013-20) Kyoto commitment periods. The country met its commitment in the first commitment period and announced in 2015 that it would cancel its surplus Kyoto Protocol units3 to support the Paris Agreement negotiating process (Government of Sweden, 2015[47]). In 2016, Denmark ratified the Paris Agreement, which replaces the Kyoto Protocol. In 2014, the EU adopted a climate and energy framework committing members to achieve, among other targets, a 40% reduction in GHG emissions, by 2030, from 1990 base levels – 43% for EU ETS sectors and 30% for non-ETS sectors. Emissions from EU ETS sectors are adjusted at the EU level via a quota system, so Denmark has no specific national target. For non-ETS sectors, Denmark defines and implements national policies and measures. In 2009, the EU adopted what is known as the effort-sharing decision, establishing binding annual GHG emission targets for 2013–20. Denmark agreed to reach a 20% reduction from 2005 levels (the biggest commitment among EU members, with Ireland and Luxembourg) and is on track to meet it. In the 2018 EU Effort Sharing Regulation, Denmark again agreed one of the most ambitious reduction targets in the EU for 2030: 39% below 2005 levels (MEUC, 2018[48]; EC[49]). This will require further mitigation efforts, and Denmark plans to take stock of its climate and air initiatives in 2022, 2024 and 2027. Non-EU ETS emissions are expected to account for about 70% of all GHG emissions by 2020. As allowed by the effort-sharing policy, and considering cost-effectiveness, Denmark has chosen to make significant use of flexibility mechanisms to achieve around 80% of the expected GHG emission reductions up to 2030 (about 21 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent or Mt CO2eq). Two-thirds of it will be achieved through land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) credits and one-third through cancellation of EU ETS quotas (Danish Government, 2018[43]). This approach triggered concerns among some Danish stakeholders that it did not support the 2050 carbon-neutrality target (Climate Council, 2018[28]). The 2018 Energy Agreement envisions reductions of 10-11 Mt CO2eq, mainly in EU ETS sectors (MEUC, 2018[50]). GHG emissions have declined significantly Having reduced its GHG emission levels by 27.7% over 2005-17 (Figure 1.9), Denmark is at the forefront of OECD countries in this regard. It is one of the few OECD countries that achieved absolute decoupling of both production-based and demand-based CO2 emissions from real GDP. The GHG emission intensity per unit of GDP is also below the OECD average (OECD, 2018[51]; IEA, 2019[52]; OECD, 2017[53]). Emissions rose in 2016, particularly in the energy and industry sectors, due to increased economic activity and climate conditions (SD, 2018[54]), but they fell again in 2017, mainly due to a significant increase in renewables (Denmark, 2019[30]). GHG emissions in EU ETS sectors decreased significantly over 2005-17 (e.g. emissions from stationary installations fell by 43%, well above the EU average of 14%) (EEA, 2018[55]). The decline was driven by a proactive policy to support diffusion of renewables, partly financed by an additional tax on electricity consumption (the Public Service Obligation, Chapter 3). GHG emissions fell more slowly in non-EU ETS sectors, where solutions are less available and more costly, declining by 18% over 2005-17 (Eurostat, 2019[56]). I.1. ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE: TRENDS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  73 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Figure 1.9. Stronger measures to reduce GHG emissions will be needed for Denmark to meet its long-term goal StatLink 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888934001844 Danish forests remained carbon sinks during the review period. The carbon stock increased over 2005-17 in both live and dead forest biomass, litter and soil (Nord-Larsen et al., 2018[57]). Cropland and grasslands, on the other hand, are net carbon sources, partly because of the large area of organic soil (peatland) drained (Nielsen et al., 2018[58]). The energy sector is the largest source of GHG emissions, at over 70%, but is also the one that has seen the most notable reduction, by over 30% between 2000 and 2017 (Figure 1.10). The decrease is mainly linked to the shift from coal to natural gas and renewables, and has mostly occurred since 2010, while for other emission sources (agriculture, industry and waste), emissions are virtually unchanged since 2010 (Nielsen et al., 2018[58]). 2050 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 2005 2010 2015 2020 2030 Mt CO2 eq GHG emissions excluding LULUCF: Historical trends, projections and targets, 2005-50 Historical emissions (excl.

GHG emissions declined more than the OECD average StatLink 2 https://doi.org/10.1787/888934001863 As in most countries, CO2 accounts for the bulk of total GHG emissions (over 70% in 2016), while methane and nitrous oxide (N2O) from agriculture accounted for about 20%, excluding LULUCF. Agricultural GHG emissions declined by 17% over 1990-2016, but since 2005 have fallen only modestly, by 3%. The reduction in methane emissions since 1990 is attributable mostly to increased use of incineration instead of other waste disposal, as methane emissions from agriculture did not change over the period. The reduction in N2O emissions is related to a considerable decline in the use of nitrogen fertilisers, but the level of emissions since 2010 has barely changed (Nielsen et al., 2018[58]). Climate change poses challenges In addition to rising temperatures, climate change is likely to bring Denmark increased precipitation, especially in winter. Over the long term, rising sea and groundwater levels will be of concern. One of the most significant challenges is increased frequency, intensity and duration of extreme weather events. In fact, Denmark was more affected than any other EU country in terms of direct economic losses per capita from weather disasters over 1980-2016 (EEA, 2018[59]). The value of assets at risk of flooding is expected to grow significantly due to sea level rise and increased precipitation (OECD, forthcoming[60]). The 2008 Danish Strategy for Adaptation to a Changing Climate focuses on targeting information, co-ordinating research strategy (e.g. through the Forskernetværk for Klimatilpasning or Climate Adaptation Research Network) and supporting co-ordinated efforts by public authorities (Danish Government, 2008[61]). The Action Plan for a Climate-proof Denmark followed in 2012, mostly focusing on enhancing state and municipal interactions (Danish Government, 2012[62]).

Atmospheric emissions and air quality Main policies and measures The 2016 EU National Emission Ceilings (NEC) Directive (replacing the 2001 directive establishing emission ceilings for 2010) addresses the 2020 targets agreed under the Gothenburg Protocol to the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) and sets objectives for 2030 (EC, 2016[63]). It establishes national emission reduction commitments applicable from 2020 and stricter targets as of 2030 for nitrogen oxides (NOX), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), sulphur dioxide (SO2), ammonia (NH3) and PM2.5 (EC, 2018[64]). The National Air Pollution Control Programme, an implementation measure supporting compliance with the NEC Directive, was announced by the government in January 2019 and submitted to the European Commission for approval in April. It is based on initiatives from the 2018 climate and air proposal (MEF, 2019[65]). For instance, for NH3 emissions it includes public financial support for low-emission barns and regulation of urea-based chemical fertilisers. Other domestic measures to help improve air quality include a ban on manure application by splash plate and a requirement to roof slurry tanks. Measures to reduce PM2.5 focus on cleaner transport and accelerated replacement of old residential wood stoves. Other means of addressing air quality in Denmark include national air quality monitoring (AU-DES, 2018[66]) and adherence to relevant multilateral environmental agreements. Denmark uses economic instruments to reduce emissions (e.g. a NOX tax), and since 2008 has applied emission standards to residential wood-burning stoves as well as supporting international work in this area. It lobbied for stricter requirements on sulphur content of ship fuel and reductions in NOX emissions from new ships. The Baltic Sea and North Sea are now International Maritime Organization Emission Control Areas4 for SOX (IMO[67]) and will become NOX emission control areas in 2021. The 2019 budget includes a scrap premium for old wood stoves (MF, 2018[44]). In addition, improved inventories of wood-burning stoves will further support targeted reduction measures. Air emissions have decreased but the outlook on 2030 targets is unclear The main sources of air pollution are agriculture (NH3, NMVOCs), motorised transport (NOX), wood combustion (PM2.5, PAHs) and industry (SOX) (Figure 1.11). With reductions in all emissions of major air pollutants in recent decades, Denmark has decoupled emissions from economic growth – most impressively in the case of SO2, emissions, which fell by 61% over 2005-16. However, by 2014 the reduction trend for air pollutants had slowed or even reversed, due chiefly to increased economic activity. 76  I.1. ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE: TRENDS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Figure 1.11. Air emissions have been on the decline but this trend has slowed StatLink 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888934001882 Denmark met its 2010 targets under the old NEC Directive by 2016. Its SO2 reductions also exceeded the 2020 reduction commitment of 35% under CLRTAP, the revised EU NEC Directive and even the 2030 target. Denmark is on track to meet its 2020 targets under the new NEC Directive for NOX (56%) and NMVOCs (35%) (AU-DES, 2018[68]). However, it will be more difficult for Denmark to meet its NEC commitments for 2020 and 2030 on fine particles (PM2.5, 33% and 55%, respectively) and NH3 (24%), despite the reductions thus far (MEF, 2019[65]). In line with the 2018 climate and air proposal, a committee will be set up to propose possible actions to reach the NH3 target (unchanged between 2020 and 2030) and initiatives have been launched to accelerate replacement of old wood-burning stoves, which would reduce PM2.5 emissions (Danish Government, 2018[43]). Denmark also needs to address potentially carcinogenic PAH emissions, which grew by 58% between 1990 and 2016. The bulk of PAHs (68%) in 2016 came from residential wood burning (AU-DES, 2018[69]). Rising residential burning also contributes to PM2.5 and NMVOC emissions. The actions taken to reduce PM2.5 emissions from wood burning will also help target PAH emissions. Air quality is a recurring issue Air quality remains a challenge (Figure 1.12). Danish estimates indicate that ambient air pollution contributed to 3 200 premature deaths, on average, over 2014-17, though the number is on the decline. Some 90% of cases were related to exposure to PM2.5 (Ellermann et al., 2018[70]). The welfare costs related to PM2.5 exposure are estimated at 3% of GDP (OECD, 2018[71]). 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 2005 = 100 Decoupling trends, 2005-17 GDP (2010 PPPs) PM ₅ NH₃ NMVOCs NOₓ SOₓ Note: EMEP data reported under the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution.\n* Emissions Reduction Commitments under the NEC Directive (final agreement, 30 June 2016).\nSource: EMEP (2019), WebDab (database); OECD (2018), OECD National Account Statistics (database).\n0 50 100 150 200 250 2005 2017 2005 2017 2005 2017 2005 2017 2005 2017 NOₓ SOₓ NMVOCs NH₃ PM .₅ 1 000 tonnes Air pollutant emissions by source, 2005 and 2017 Agriculture/waste IPPU Other combustion Industry combustion Power stations Other mobile Road transport Targets 2020* Targets 2030* I.1.

Chemicals management Denmark has a comprehensive regulatory framework for chemicals management, with national rules that sometimes go beyond the scope of the EU acquis. There is good co-operation between government, industry and other stakeholders. Public health and environmental protection issues are at the heart of Denmark’s chemicals management policy, which pays particular attention to substitution of hazardous chemicals and the safety of chemicals in consumer products. A challenge is to strike the right balance between the resources used for predictive risk assessment and the various risk-based monitoring exercises. If Denmark put more emphasis on identifying problematic chemicals and regulating them before a negative impact can be detected in humans or the environment, it would avoid having to deal with the risks they pose to nature and humans (Chapter 5). 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Share of population exposed to PM2.5, by WHO thresholds, 2017 Less than 10 μg/m³ (%) 10-15 μg/m³ (%) 15-25 μg/m³ (%) 25-35 μg/m³ (%) More than 35 μg/m³ (%) 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 2000 2005 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 % Share of population exposed to PM2.5 exceeding the WHO Air Quality Guideline (10 цg/m3), 2000-17 Aarhus Odense Copenhagen Aalborg 0 100 200 300 400 500 2005 2010 2017 2005 2010 2017 Denmark OECD total Deaths/million inhabitants Number of premature deaths caused by ambient PM pollution, Denmark and the OECD, 2005-17 Diabetes/kidney diseases Chronic respiratory Cardiovascular Neoplasms Respiratory infections/TB Source: OECD (2018), “Exposure to air pollution”, OECD Environment Statistics (database).\n78  I.1. ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE: TRENDS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 1.3.6. Waste, materials management and circular economy The Danish economy uses a large amount of raw materials per unit of GDP, which translates into low resource productivity. Denmark has become more efficient in the use of materials, but not enough to achieve the average performance of OECD countries. In 2016, resource productivity reached USD 1.95 per kg in Denmark, compared with USD 2.42 per kg in OECD countries (Chapter 4). In 2017, domestic consumption of materials per capita was about 24 tonnes, well above the OECD average of 16 tonnes per capita. About half of domestic material consumption is related to the construction sector (stone, gravel and sand extraction). Waste generation as a whole increased by 30% between 2010 and 2016, to some 20 million tonnes. This increase was related to growth in construction and demolition waste, which accounted for more than 60% of the waste produced in 2016. Municipal waste generation also increased, by 12% between 2005 and 2016, faster than private final consumption. Landfilling has almost disappeared (it amounted to 1% of municipal waste in 2016) and Denmark has very high levels of recycling. Waste from industry, construction and demolition, packaging, electrical and electronic equipment and end-of-life vehicles is recycled at rates ranging from 70% to 90%. About half of municipal waste is not recycled, however, and feeds incinerators for energy recovery (Chapter 4). 1.3.7. Agricultural inputs and nitrogen balance The coherence of agricultural and environmental policies needs special attention in view of the high rate of land use by agriculture (Section 1.5.1). The share of agriculture, forestry and fishing in GDP was halved over 2000-17, from 2.5% to 1.3%. Yet the agriculture and agri-food sector still accounted for 25% of Danish goods exports in 2015. The national balance of nitrogen in agriculture places Denmark above the OECD average (Figure 1.13). The nitrogen surplus has fluctuated between 77 and 94 kg N/ha since 2005 and remains a source of concern for nitrate pollution of coastal areas (OECD, 2018[72]). Figure 1.13.

They are expressed in tonnes of nutrient surplus or deficit. This calculation can be used as a proxy for the status of environmental pressures, such as declining soil fertility in the case of a nutrient deficit or, for a nutrient surplus, the risk of polluting soil, water and air. OECD values are simple averages of the nitrogen balances of OECD countries for which data are available.\nSource: Blicher-Mathiesen et al.

ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE: TRENDS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  79 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Main policies and measures The EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) for 2014-20 is the backbone of Denmark’s agri-environmental policy. In particular, the CAP Rural Development Programme (RDP) supported a former goal of doubling the area under organic farming from 150 000 ha in 2007 to 300 000 ha in 2020. Nearly 280 000 ha, or 10.5% of the agricultural area, was already under organic farming by mid-2018 (Danish Agricultural Agency, 2019[73]). Beyond the public financial support provided under the RDP, increased consumer demand for organic products is a key factor in the growth of organic farming. In 2017, Denmark had the world’s largest market share of organic products: 13.3% of the total food market (Willer and Lernoud, 2019[74]). The RDP also includes funds for 1 000 mini-wetlands to remove nutrients from drain water at the farm level; 7 500 ha of new forests; and R&D projects to reduce GHG emissions from agriculture (EC, 2017[75]). A Food and Agriculture Package adopted in 2015 put in place “targeted regulation” of agricultural practices reflecting the risk of nitrate pollution of coastal waters. The aim is to improve cost-effectiveness by focusing nitrate reduction efforts on watersheds flowing into coastal waters threatened with eutrophication, giving farmers in other watersheds the opportunity to fertilise to the economic optimum. Before the regulation went into force, all farmers had to fertilise about 20% below the economic optimum (EPA, 2017[76]). The agriculture sector moderately reduced its GHG emissions between 2005 and 2016, while the OECD average increased (Figure 1.10). Efforts are still needed to reach Denmark’s carbon neutrality target of 2050. To this end, R&D programmes have been launched under the climate and air proposal covering non-EU ETS emissions. The goal is to identify relevant agricultural practices and incentives for them by 2030. The use of biogas from manure can support climate and pollution goals. For example, using manure as a raw material for biogas instead of spreading it as fertiliser reduces the risk of air pollution (NH3) and water pollution (nitrates), and digested manure provides a high-quality natural fertiliser that emits less N2O than untreated manure. The 2018 Energy Agreement includes provisions to expand the use of biogas and other green gases, for instance in transport and industrial processes. A gas strategy is to be developed, focusing on using the Danish gas infrastructure and examining framework conditions for a competitive expansion of biogas and other green gases. The 2018 climate and air proposal also contains related measures, e.g. on detecting and reducing leaks from existing biogas plants (Government of Denmark et al., 2018[21]; Danish Government, 2018[43]). 1.4. Managing the natural asset base 1.4.1. Physical context Croplands cover some 60% of Denmark’s area, forests 13%, light-open habitats such as heath, dunes, meadows and marshes 9%, and artificial surfaces (urbanised areas) and inland waters the remaining 18% (SD, 2017[77]). The high proportion of croplands underlines the importance of ensuring coherence of agricultural policies with protection of the environment, and the 22% coverage of forests and light-open habitats indicates a need for promoting management of their ecosystem services. 1.4.2. Biodiversity and ecosystems Some 30 000 species of plants, animals and fungi can be found in Denmark. About 15% of mammal, bird and freshwater species are threatened (Figure 1.14).

ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE: TRENDS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 the animal species covered by the EU Habitats Directive had “unfavourable” status, compared with the EU average of 60% (Danish Government, 2014[78]). More than half the species on the red list (54%) depend on forest habitats for survival (NA, 2014[79]). Half the lichen species are threatened, reflecting high nitrogen deposition (NH3 and NOX). Figure 1.14. Some 15% of mammal, bird and fish species are threatened StatLink 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888934001939 Main policies and measures The Nature Protection Act (2013) has three objectives: to protect nature, restore or create areas of interest for wildlife and landscapes, and give the public access to nature. It implements the EU directives on birds and habitats. The National Strategy for Biodiversity 2014-20, also known as Danish Nature Policy (Naturplan Danmark), aims at improving connectivity of natural habitats, strengthening wildlife protection initiatives and developing a sense of community through outdoor activities in nature. It does not, however, include targets for protected areas. The 2016-19 Nature Package outlines plans to increase the area of “biodiversity forests” from 11 700 ha in 2016 to up to 28 300 ha in 2066, mainly in state-owned forests. By January 2019, 22 800 ha of such forests had been designated in state-owned forests; designation of other forest areas will be gradual over the next 50 years. Biodiversity forests have a more stringent biodiversity protection objective than other forests and less intensive or no management. Amendments to the Planning Act in 2015 and 2017 introduced a requirement for municipalities to plan and designate existing and potential areas of special nature protection interest and wildlife corridors for a Green Map of Denmark (including existing Natura 2000 sites). The Green Map will reinforce efforts to establish larger and more interconnected areas of special nature protection interest. The map is gradually being developed as municipalities revise their land-use plans (Chapter 2). The Danish Environmental Protection Agency has developed a planning tool to help municipalities locate threatened species, habitats of high natural value and potential forest habitats for inclusion on the Green Map. Once the designation process is complete, the Green Map will provide a more accurate picture of the extent and location of existing and potential areas of particular 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Mammals Birds Freshwater fish Amphibians Vascular plants Lichens % Threatened indigenous species,a late 2000s % of known species % of indigenous species Total number of known species 67 209 15 676 2 909 55 a) Threatened refers to the sum of “endangered”, “critically endangered” and “vulnerable” species, i.e. species that are at greatest risk of extinction.

The vast majority of light-open habitats (those with no or only limited tree cover, such as meadows, heathlands, bogs and dry grasslands) and most freshwater lakes (totalling about 10% of the country’s area) are included in Section 3 of the Nature Protection Act (Levin, 2016[82]). This gives them general protection. As a general rule, all activities that could have a direct negative impact on the integrity of habitats covered by Section 3 are prohibited. This includes, for example, the use of fertilisers, pesticides and cultivation. Only ancestral extensive farming practices can be maintained. The area of Section 3 habitats increased by 9% over 2006-16 (Levin, 2016[82]). The Ministry of Environment and Food (MEF) estimated in April 2019 that 15% of Danish terrestrial habitats and inland waters were protected by law (Table 1.2). This is close to the global Aichi target of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) to protect at least 17% of terrestrial habitats by 2020. In addition to the habitats in Section 3, terrestrial protected areas in Denmark include Natura 2000 sites and “conservation areas” (Table 1.2). Table 1.2.

Source: Country submission. However, since most Danish protected areas have not been classified according to the different protection categories defined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), it is difficult to assess their degree of protection. To assign a protected area to an IUCN category, the area must be managed. Privately owned areas protected under Section 3 of the Nature Protection Act are not subject to statutory management requirements. There is no information at the national level on the extent of management in these areas, although this does not mean they are not managed. The Danish system of nature conservation consists of both designated protected areas, including Natura 2000 sites, and generally protected habitats. Only protected areas in accordance with Section 33 of the Nature Protection Act have been classified into IUCN categories. Danish reporting to the IUCN World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) overestimated the coverage of terrestrial protected areas. In particular, an IUCN expert group in 2018 found that the total number of protected areas regulated by specific conservation orders (within the meaning of Section 33 of the Nature Protection Act) was about 400, not 1 843 as previously reported to the WDPA (Woollhead and Petersen, n.d.[83]; MEF, 2019[80]). The 82  I.1. ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE: TRENDS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Danish Nature Agency has undertaken a more rigorous calculation of the extent and type of terrestrial protected areas. Until 2008, Denmark did not have national parks. It has since designated five national parks, the latest in 2018. Entrance is free. In general, the same rules apply inside and outside the parks, which are not fenced. However, in most national parks, specific planning zones impose restrictions on specific activities. The National Parks Act stipulates ten non-prioritised objectives. Each national park is established by an executive order in which the declared objectives appear. Each park is managed in a decentralised manner, with a board, a council and a secretariat. The board and its chair are appointed by the environment minister. The board prepares a plan for the operation and development of the park. The local community is invited to participate in this process. The development of national parks takes several years and is based on voluntary agreements with private landowners and local support. Whenever possible, board members have close ties to the national park area. The 257 Natura 2000 sites cover 366 000 ha or 8.5% of Denmark’s land area, the lowest share in the EU (EC, 2018[84]). They include 124 Special Protection Areas (SPAs) under the Birds Directive and 269 Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) under the Habitats Directive; 86 Natura 2000 sites overlap SPAs and SACs. The European Commission is to decide on revised coverage of Natura 2000 sites (Table 1.2) by the end of 2019 (Denmark, 2019[30]). The first phase of Natura 2000 plans covered 2009-15 and the second phase covers 2016-21. Prior to launch, plans are subject to a three-month public consultation exercise. DKK 2 billion (EUR 270 million) has been allocated for implementation of the 2016-21 plans, partly from the RDP. These plans must be followed by local action plans developed by municipalities and owners of state land. Many Natura 2000 sites overlap with other forms of nature conservation. The latest assessment of the state of conservation of Natura 2000 sites, published in 2014, revealed that in 2013, almost 70% of habitats had unfavourable or bad status, compared with the EU average of 30% (Figure 1.16). Surprisingly, only 27% of species covered by the Habitats Directive had unfavourable or bad conservation status (Figure 1.16), which would seem to indicate the important role played by other forms of nature conservation (Table 1.2). I.1. ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE: TRENDS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  83 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Figure 1.15. The state of natural habitats in Denmark remains poor StatLink 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888934001958 A new National Forest Programme (NFP) was adopted in 2018. It builds on the two long-term objectives of the previous NFP of 2002: i) increase forest cover so that the forest landscape covers 20% to 25% of the land area by the end of the century (compared to 13% now) and ii) ensure that by 2040, at least 10% of the Danish forest cover has biological diversity as its main management objective (MEF, 2018[85]). Expansion of “biodiversity forests” is thus linked, within the framework of the NFP, to extension of the total forest area. Steps are needed to accelerate the pace of afforestation and achieve the long-term objectives of the NFP, as forest area has increased only slightly since 2005 (Nord-Larsen et al., 2017[86]). A report from 2016 estimates that at least 75 000 ha of “biodiversity forest” is needed to stop the decline in biodiversity (Petersen et al., 2016[87]). Marine protected areas (MPAs) cover 15% (881 325 ha) of the Danish North Sea area, including Skagerrak, and 3% (35 300 ha) of the Danish Baltic Sea area. Lack of data limits analysis of MPA network coherence in these two marine areas (Edelvang K. et al., 2017[88]). Other MPAs have been proposed, covering 4% (65 000 ha) of the Danish part of Kattegat (NA, 2015[89]). No designation of MPAs in the Belt Sea or the Øresund is envisaged. The North Sea area MPAs by themselves meet the Aichi target of protecting at least 10% of coastal and marine areas by 2020. Denmark submitted its sixth report to the CBD in 2019. It states that ambitious new goals for nature should guide the development of a new National Strategy for Biodiversity (MEF, 2019[81]). 1.4.3. Management of coastal waters and freshwater Denmark has many coasts and fjords and uses chemically untreated groundwater for the production of drinking water (OECD, 2017[90]). At the same time, it has the largest proportion of cultivated land among OECD countries, with the associated risk of nutrient and pesticide pollution. Until 2009, three Aquatic Action Plans targeted the leaching of nitrogen from the root zone. Since then, Denmark has sought instead to reduce the nitrogen load in coastal waters, irrespective of the pathway (leaching or run-off) (MEF, 2017[91]). 0 20 40 60 80 100 2007 2013 % Species 0 20 40 60 80 100 2007 2013 % Habitats Unfavourable/bad Unfavourable/inadequate Unknown Favourable Source: EC (2014), National Summary for Article 17 of the Habitats Directive, Report 2007-12.\nOverall assessment of conservation status of habitats and species, 2007 and 2013 84  I.1. ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE: TRENDS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Water quality The ecological status of lakes, rivers and groundwater has improved in eastern Denmark (OECD, 2018[92]), but problems remain in meeting the requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD). Measures taken under Aquatic Action Plan III (2005-09) and River Basin Management Plan (RBMP) 2009-15 helped reduce the agricultural nitrogen surplus by 7% between 2005-07 and 2013-15, though it remains above the OECD average (Figure 1.13). Under the 2009-15 RBMP, nitrogen emission reduction was 27% lower than initially planned (EC, 2016[93]) and nitrogen discharges into coastal waters were reduced by only 10%. The situation has not improved significantly under the 2015-21 RBMP. In 2017, only 1.7% of coastal waters, 20% of lakes and 30% of rivers had achieved good ecological status (Figure 1.17). The proposed Marine Strategy II, to be adopted by 2021, focuses on eutrophication risk management in coastal waters (MEF, 2018[94]). Less than half the country’s groundwater bodies have good chemical status (Figure 1.17). Denmark’s performance is below the EU average, but better than that of other intensively farmed countries in northern Europe, such as the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany (EEA, 2018[95]). Figure 1.16. The status of water bodies has improved but remains an issue StatLink 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888934001977 Denmark expects to achieve the WFD objectives for 50 of its 119 coastal water areas by 2021. To this end, EUR 830 million, more than half the 2015-21 RBMP budget, is devoted to wetland creation, afforestation, set-aside of agricultural land, catch crops and ecological focus areas (where agricultural production is prohibited). A further third of the budget goes to wastewater treatment and the remaining 13% is related to lake and river restoration. The third RBMP (2021-27) raises ambitions. In particular, Denmark will have to reduce nitrogen discharges into coastal waters to 44 700 tonnes per year by 2027, compared to around 60 000 tonnes per year in 2013-15. The presence of pesticides and their metabolites in groundwater remains a concern.

Authorised pesticides and their metabolites were detected at levels exceeding the limit of 0.1 μg/l in 1.6% of these intakes (GEUS, 2019[96])(Chapter 5). In 2019, municipalities were invited to review the effectiveness of protection zones around drinking water wells and to enforce the ban on the use of pesticides in these areas through voluntary approaches. If voluntary approaches prove ineffective by 2022, the government reserves the right to impose pesticide-free agriculture in the protection zones (MEF, 2019[97]). Some water companies have taken the lead in deciding to pay farmers not to use pesticides in these areas. Main policies and measures The 2015 Food and Agriculture Package introduced a policy change known as “targeted regulation”. Until 2017, Denmark applied the same rules to all farmers by implementing the Nitrates Action Programme throughout the country. This regulatory base has been supplemented by a targeted catch crops programme since 2017 and targeted regulation since 2019. The package now provides for targeted regulation of agricultural practices, based on the risk of pollution of coastal waters. This is a step in the right direction as it improves cost-effectiveness by focusing efforts on vulnerable coastal areas in accordance with WFD provisions, although Denmark still takes a full-country approach with regard to the Nitrates Directive. Targeted regulation aims to focus nitrogen reduction efforts on watersheds threatened by nitrogen pollution (Figure 1.17), leaving farmers in other watersheds more flexibility in managing the use of their nutrients than was the case with non-targeted regulation (MEF, 2015[98]).

ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE: TRENDS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Recommendations on climate, air, biodiversity and water Mitigating climate change  Make every effort to achieve the goal of further reducing GHG emissions by 2030, including identifying misalignment of sectoral policies with climate policy, mobilising private finance and seeking synergies with other environmental policies (on air, water, waste, biodiversity).  Develop a vision for a carbon-neutral Denmark by 2050, considering the development and export promotion of technological solutions (for energy efficiency, renewables, and CCS) and cost-effectiveness (including using international carbon markets to offset emissions). Improving air quality  Redouble efforts to reduce ammonia emissions so as to achieve the 2030 target set by the NEC Directive; in particular, seek synergies with nitrate policies, taking into account the nitrogen cycle; ensure policy coherence between ammonia emission management and expansion of biogas as a renewable energy resource.  Continue efforts to address urban PM2.5 pollution, including reducing particle emissions from residential wood burning.  Strengthen international co-operation to support Denmark’s efforts to control transboundary air pollution from international ship traffic. Addressing biodiversity  Update the 2014 Biodiversity Strategy in light of initiatives put in place since its launch (e.g. Nature Package, National Forest Programme, RDP, Green Map), and ensure their coherence; pending development of the Green Map by 2050, set intermediate targets for protected areas and connectivity, taking into account progress on the CBD Biodiversity Strategic Plan 2021-30.  Provide sufficient public financial support to achieve the goal for “biodiversity forests” on both state-owned and private land; evaluate their impact, as well as that of the policy of increasing forest cover, on carbon sequestration.  Establish a natural area connectivity strategy targeting threatened species, in close partnership with civil society and municipalities. Improving water quality  Continue to improve the cost-effectiveness of measures to reduce nitrate pollution of coastal waters; in particular, continue to implement the targeted regulation, focusing on watersheds at risk; estimate the effects of this targeted regulation on N2O emissions with a view to seeking synergies.  Improve the effectiveness of voluntary approaches to farmers in preventing pesticide use around drinking water abstraction wells; in particular, incorporate the suggestion that additional instruments will have to be applied if the objective of pesticide-free areas is not achieved.

Denmark is part of the Nordic electricity market and variations in hydropower availability in Norway and Sweden have traditionally been balanced by coal-fired plants in Denmark (IEA, 2017[1]). 3 The Kyoto Protocol established a cap-and-trade system, imposing national caps on the GHG emissions of developed countries that ratified the protocol. Each participating country is assigned an emission target and a corresponding number of allowances called Assigned Amount Units, which are tradable emission permits (Carbon Market Watch, 2012[102]). 4 The MARPOL Convention introduced the emission control areas to reduce emissions of SOX and NOX in designated sea areas.

Environmental governance and management Denmark has a well-functioning environmental governance and management system characterised by high levels of co-operation and consensus. However, there is scope to use existing strengths, such as expertise in socio-economic assessments and a comprehensive risk-based inspection system, to further strengthen policy making and gain a better understanding of non-compliance with environmental rules. This chapter provides an overview of developments in environmental governance and management in Denmark. It describes the institutional and legal framework, use of policy evaluation tools and mechanisms for compliance assurance. Finally, it examines efforts to promote environmental democracy through public participation, environmental information and access to justice. The statistical data for Israel are supplied by and under the responsibility of the relevant Israeli authorities. The use of such data by the OECD is without prejudice to the status of the Golan Heights, East Jerusalem and Israeli settlements in the West Bank under the terms of international law. 98  I.2. ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 2.1. Introduction Denmark has a well-functioning environmental governance and management system. It benefits from high levels of co-operation and consensus. Particular strengths include an informal system of cross-party political agreements, strong participation of civil society in policy making and high-quality independent advisory bodies. Inter-ministerial co-ordination on environment-related policies at the central level is well established. The country also has a comprehensive risk-based inspection system covering not only large installations, but also small and medium-sized enterprises. Since a 2007 reform, Denmark’s 98 municipalities have been responsible for most aspects of environmental management. To manage the transition, the country implemented a recommendation in the previous OECD Environmental Performance Review (2007) by setting up task forces to help municipalities carry out their new tasks. It also integrated monitoring of national environmental action plans in the National Monitoring and Assessment Programme for the Aquatic and Terrestrial Environment (NOVANA), in line with another recommendation. Finally, it used cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis widely, e.g. based on updated guidelines on socio-economic assessment from 2017. However, Denmark has not yet made it mandatory to apply the guidelines on socio-economic assessment when making government decisions touching on the environment or in regulatory impact assessment. While its risk-based inspection system is effective, the country does not yet make full use of inspection data to understand non-compliance among companies. Finally, there is a continued need for capacity building as well as guidance on implementation and the use of enforcement measures to help municipalities manage environmental challenges. This chapter provides an overview of environmental governance and management in Denmark. It describes the institutional and legal framework, use of policy evaluation tools and mechanisms for compliance assurance. Finally, it examines efforts to promote environmental democracy through public participation, environmental information and access to justice. 2.2. Institutional framework Denmark has a decentralised environmental governance system in which jurisdiction on the environment is shared among the national, local and, to a lesser extent, regional levels. The national level sets the legal framework and provides guidance on implementation. It also develops national plans, programmes and strategies. Local authorities are responsible for municipal and local planning; implementation of policies, plans and programmes; and issuance of most environmental permits and related inspection. 2.2.1. National institutions The review period saw a number of changes in the distribution of environmental responsibilities at the national level. In 2007, a Ministry of Climate and Energy was established. Previously, climate change had been part of the Ministry of Environment. The rationale for a separate climate ministry was mainly the need to prepare for the 15th Session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, held in Copenhagen in December 2009. The merging of the climate and energy portfolios facilitated reform of energy policy to support climate objectives, as evidenced by the ambitious Energy Agreements of 2012 and 2018. In 2015, economic regulation of I.2. ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT  99 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 waste and water utilities was added to the portfolio, creating the Ministry of Climate, Energy and Utilities (MCEU). In 2015, the Ministry of Environment and Ministry of Food and Agriculture were merged into the Ministry of Environment and Food (MEF), similar to the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The rationale was to help balance the sometimes competing interests of the environment and agricultural policy. At the same time, the Ministry of Industry, Business and Financial Affairs (MIBFA) took on responsibility for the Danish Planning Act and national guidelines for spatial planning. MEF and MCEU share jurisdiction on the waste and water sectors. MEF is responsible for environmental standards related to these sectors, while MCEU oversees their economic regulation, including the setting of rules on charges for the use of water services and waste collection services. The division of responsibilities took effect in 2015 to unite all utility sectors in one ministry and thereby facilitate a focus on improving their efficiency across the economy. In addition, a utility regulator under MCEU was established in July 2018. It oversees the electricity, natural gas and district heating sectors with a view to ensuring efficiency, the lowest possible prices for consumers, stable and secure energy supply, cost-effective technological development and green transition. The Utilities Secretariat in the Competition and Consumer Authority under MIBFA sets price caps and efficiency gain requirements for the water and wastewater sectors. The Ministry of Transport, Building and Housing is responsible for policies in its portfolio areas. The Ministry of Taxation is responsible for legislation related to taxation and for collecting taxes, while the Ministry of Finance builds Denmark’s public sector budget through the yearly Finance Act. It also provides cross-government policy co-ordination, e.g. as the secretariat of the government Economic Committee and as chair of ad hoc inter-ministerial policy committees. Denmark stands out for its strong performance on inter-ministerial co-ordination. The government Finance Committee must approve all policies with major implications for public finances or the economy, including much environmental policy. The finance minister heads the committee, which is convened weekly. A Co-ordination Committee, headed by the prime minister, discusses environmental initiatives that are considered high priority, have significant foreign policy implications or affect Greenland and the Faroe Islands. It also meets weekly. In both committees, ministers with responsibilities in the environmental domain are invited to join the deliberations when files touch upon their responsibilities. Environmental impact assessments are included in the files when relevant, and revised if committee decisions differ from those proposed in the files so that the government is aware of the impact of its decisions on the environment. However, there is no requirement to follow specific guidelines on conducting environmental assessments. In 2015, the government set up an EU Implementation Committee. It discusses business-related EU legislation. The aim is to ensure that implementation of EU rules does not put more burdens on Danish companies than EU law requires unless important considerations such as consumer protection justify it. An EU Implementation Council, consisting of experts and representatives from business, labour unions and consumer protection groups, advises the committee. The Danish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is a technical agency in charge of environmental policy implementation, monitoring, permitting and inspections. It includes the Chemical Inspectorate and decentralised units in Slagelse and Aarhus inspecting the most complex and potentially most environmentally harmful companies. The Danish 100  I.2. ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Nature Agency manages MEF’s approximately 200 000 ha of forests and natural areas. Within the agency, the Danish Coastal Authority is responsible for the protection of 7 300 km of coastline. The Danish Maritime Authority supervises and inspects ships sailing under the Danish flag and provides port state control over health, safety and environmental protection. 2.2.2. Subnational institutions The Constitution guarantees municipalities the right to decide their own affairs under state supervision. The notion of municipal autonomy has continued to shape the role of municipalities. For example, more than 75% of municipal revenue comes from local taxation. While the national level provides a budgetary transfer in the form of a block grant, municipalities decide how it is spent. Equalisation between richer and poorer municipalities partly offsets differences in income levels, contributing to capacity in less affluent municipalities. Municipal budgets are determined in yearly agreements between the government and Local Government Denmark, which represents municipalities. If the government imposes new responsibilities on municipalities, it must compensate them for the cost through a transfer called a DUT payment. Public-private partnerships are not widely used by municipalities, e.g. in providing water and sanitation services. In 2007, Denmark introduced a reform of its local administrative structure. The number of municipalities was reduced from 271 to 98, and 14 counties were replaced by 5 regions. In the process, most county environmental responsibilities were transferred to either the enlarged municipalities or the national level. Regions inherited limited environmental responsibilities, such as handling raw material extraction and contaminated soils (Box 2.1). In March 2019, the government decided that these responsibilities would be transferred to the national level. Box 2.1. The 2007 municipal reform and the environment In 2007, Denmark introduced a wide-ranging reform of the structure of its local authorities. The aim was to form larger, highly competent and financially sustainable municipalities of at least 30 000 inhabitants. The number of municipalities was reduced from 271 to 98, and 14 counties were replaced by 5 regions. The municipal reform saw a transfer of most county environmental responsibilities to the municipal or national level. New municipal responsibilities after 2007  Most public administration functions under Danish environmental legislation and citizen-related duties  Preparation of action plans under the Environmental Objectives Act (protected areas), wastewater management plans, water supply plans and municipal waste management plans  Maintenance of watercourses to allow free passage of water  Municipal and local spatial planning New responsibilities at national level after 2007  Duties related to Denmark’s international obligations, duties of major national I.2.

The 2007 Environmental Performance Review of Denmark recommended setting up capacity-building mechanisms to help municipalities carry out new environmental management tasks. The national level has done this by establishing task forces that provide free assistance to municipalities in environmental planning. They have covered areas such as installation of wind turbines and biogas plants, municipal climate adaptation plans, groundwater protection and permitting of livestock farms. The EPA also issues guidance to municipalities on how to implement environmental legislation. Further such guidance could be strengthened by learning from international best practice, e.g. Switzerland’s enforcement aids to cantons. In March 2013, an evaluation concluded that the municipal reform had succeeded in creating a framework for a more robust public sector. It found that technical expertise and financial sustainability had generally been improved and that political decision making in municipalities had become more strategic. At the same time, the evaluation pointed out that the potential benefits in efficiency gains and quality had not yet been fully reaped (MEAI, 2013[2]). Concerning the environment, the evaluation recommended more inter-municipal co-operation on nature and water management. It also noted that the reform had divided responsibility for permitting and inspecting the most environmentally complex companies (those covered by the EU Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control [IPPC] Directive) between the municipalities and EPA. However, maintaining the expertise to handle the companies at municipal level was challenging, since half the municipalities had fewer than four such companies in their jurisdiction. Therefore, the evaluation recommended that the government should consider transferring permitting of all companies under the directive, excluding livestock farms, to the national level. Alternatively, as landfills accounted for a substantial share of the companies, it recommended uniting landfill permitting (a municipal responsibility) and inspection (an EPA task) at either the national or municipal level, to avoid inconsistency. Similarly, the evaluation recommended unifying planning and permitting of raw material extraction at either the regional or municipal level. 102  I.2. ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 In June 2013, all parties in the Danish Parliament reached a political agreement on adjustments to the structural reform. These included decisions to transfer landfill permitting from the municipal to the national level and permitting of raw material extraction from the municipal to the regional level, the aim being to improve technical capacity and efficiency. However, they decided not to transfer to the national level permitting and inspection of all non-livestock companies covered by the Industrial Emissions Directive, which had since replaced the IPCC directive. Municipalities continue to be responsible for some types of these companies, e.g. in the area of waste management, under Statutory Order No 1517 of 07/12/2016 on environmental permits. To address the recommendation on more inter-municipal co-operation in water and nature management, a joint working group between the national level and Local Government Denmark was formed to support municipalities in this area. The introduction of river basin management has since improved cross-municipal co-operation on water management. In addition, a major initiative on wetlands launched by MEF in 2010 led to grouping of municipalities at the catchment level to ensure cohesion in decision making. Denmark should expand the use of task forces to build municipal capacity in environmental management areas where it faces challenges, such as waste prevention (Chapter 4). 2.3. Legal framework Denmark is a parliamentary democracy characterised by proportional representation, minority governments and a high level of cross-party co-operation. To enhance political stability and policy continuity, governments often seek to form political agreements with parties outside government on key policies (Box 2.2). Box 2.2. Cross-party political agreements Since the early 20th century, political parties in the Danish Parliament have used written political agreements as a legally non-binding tool outside the normal legislative process. Parties that enter into a political agreement commit themselves to support the legislation necessary to implement it. This is a way for minority governments to be sure that a parliamentary majority supports its legislative proposals before it presents them to Parliament. More importantly, parties use political agreements to “bind” each other to decisions that may prove unpopular (e.g. structural reform) or for which long-term continuity is key (e.g. incentives for companies to invest in renewables). Governments often publish plans, strategies or proposals as a starting point for negotiations on political agreements. For example, the government’s energy proposal of April 2018, “Energy for a Green Denmark”, was followed by negotiations leading in June 2018 to a political agreement by all parties in Parliament. Political agreements in the environmental area also cover areas including the Danish climate law, spatial planning, nature policy, circular economy, regulation of the waste management sector, chemical management, pesticide management, targeted nitrogen regulation, and phosphorous regulation of livestock farms. Source: (Christiansen, 2008[3]). Denmark led the 2012 OECD Environmental Policy Stringency Index, which measured the policy-induced cost of pollution by firms across a range of sectors and policy instruments I.2. ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT  103 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 (OECD, 2016[4]). Perceived policy stringency has been shown to be a key factor in bringing about improved environmental performance in companies (OECD, 2007[5]). The Environmental Protection Act, last amended in 2017, is the central piece of legislation on prevention and management of pollution in Denmark. It sets general quality requirements for air, water, waste, soil (above and below ground) and noise. The act sets out fundamental environmental protection objectives and the means by which they are to be met. It is a framework act, supplemented by guidelines and statutory orders issued by MEF. The Environmental Objectives Act, last amended in 2016, governs protected areas, including the management of Natura 2000 areas. Under the act, the environment minister designates internationally protected areas and prepares a plan for each Natura 2000 area. Municipalities are charged with preparing action plans for each area to implement the national plans locally. The Soil Contamination Act, last amended in 2016, charges the regions with mapping and managing contaminated soil. It partly transposes the EU directives on environmental liability and industrial emissions. The Environmental Damage Act, last amended in 2017, is the main legislation transposing the Environmental Liability Directive. It applies the polluter-pays principle by establishing that the responsible party must bear the costs associated with preventing or remedying ecological damage. Denmark has a good record on the speed and quality of transposition of EU environmental legislation. There have been few complaints and infringement cases (Table 2.1). Denmark is also highly active at the EU level on many environmental files. One example is the updating of EU legislation on the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals (REACH), which entered into force in 2007 (Chapter 5). Table 2.1. Infringements of EU legislation Directive Concern Decision type Decision data Environmental Liability Directive 2004/35/CE Transposition in Danish legislation Formal notice 2016 Ambient Air Quality Directive 2008/50/EC Breach of compliance with NO2 limit values Formal notice 2016 Source: European Commission (infringement decisions against Denmark as of December 2018). The review period has seen important changes to Danish environmental legislation. The 2014 Climate Act, for example, established an independent Climate Council to advise the government on matters such as how to achieve climate targets cost-effectively. The government must respond to the council’s recommendations in a yearly climate report to Parliament. The law requires the government to set national greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets at least every five years with a ten-year time frame. In 2013, Parliament adopted a revised Water Planning Act, transposing the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) and establishing the legal framework for river basin management. It provides for active involvement of civil society in the drafting of RBMPs through municipally managed water councils comprising representatives from environment and agriculture groups. To facilitate their work, the government informs them of the cost-effectiveness of measures that could be implemented in the watershed. In 2015, Parliament adopted the Food and Agriculture Package. Consequently, changes have been made to the Fertiliser Act and Animal Husbandry Act to boost food production 104  I.2. ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 while respecting environmental legislation by applying a more targeted approach to nutrient pollution mitigation efforts. 2.3.1. Direct environmental regulation Over the years, Denmark has made extensive use of pricing instruments, such as taxes and charges, and financial support instruments to manage environmental issues (Chapter 3). Nevertheless, direct environmental regulation is still the main approach used for environmental policy instruments. While the ultimate goal of such regulation is to improve environmental quality (e.g. urban air quality), it may not be practical to ascribe such a result to a single policy intervention. In such cases, direct regulation can be defined in terms of outcome (e.g. vehicle emission standards) or design (e.g. use of a particular technology, such as particle filters). Its effectiveness can thus be measured in terms of result, outcome or design. Introducing flexibility in direct environmental regulation can help reduce compliance costs, particularly regarding how to reduce emissions, for example when a design-based standard requiring the use of a specific abatement technology is replaced by an outcome-based standard that sets pollutant emission limits (OECD, 2018[6]). This allows companies to abate or reduce emissions at the source and by whatever means is convenient; they can select a process in their plant for abatement and also compensate emissions with reductions at other sources. Denmark increasingly favours outcome-based over design-based direct regulation to give producers more flexibility on how to comply. Regulation of excess nutrients from farms is a good example. In 2015, Denmark decided to replace a requirement to establish buffer zones without fertilisers, crops or pesticides along certain streams and lakes with a more targeted regulation giving farmers flexibility on the choice of abatement measures (Box 2.3). Similarly, environmental permits for livestock farms require the use of best available techniques, expressed as an outcome level of emissions from farms to the environment. Farmers are free to choose among available techniques or technologies. Box 2.3. Targeting nitrogen regulation improves cost-effectiveness Excess nitrogen from agriculture is a main source of pressure on water quality in Denmark’s coastal waters and fjords. Uniform regulation, such as farm-level nitrogen quotas, has helped reduce the excess. However, since water pollution risk varies widely across the country, this has been suboptimal from both an environmental and a cost-effectiveness perspective. To improve water quality in a more targeted (i.e. risk-based) way, Denmark is implementing a new policy. For each of its 90 river sub-basins, it has estimated how much excess agricultural nitrogen must decrease for coastal waters to attain good status under the WFD. In parallel, it has estimated the amount of nitrogen retained in soil on the way from farms to coastal waters, based on 3 000 units. By combining the required reduction in each sub-basin with retention rates in soil, Denmark determines the effort that must be made in each of the 3 000 units. Efforts to reduce excess agricultural nitrogen are thus differentiated according to the risk of water pollution (the extent to which each coastal water needs protection) and cost-effectiveness (where abatement measures are most effective). Public financial support is available on request. It is combined with an uncompensated direct regulation backstop mechanism if I.2. ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT  105 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 voluntary participation is insufficient to achieve the required reduction. To ensure cost-effectiveness at farm level, farmers can freely choose among abatement measures whose effect has been documented by Danish universities. An international expert panel found that Denmark had achieved the highest possible standard of WFD implementation with respect to methodology and determination of required actions (MEF, 2017[7]). 2.3.2. Land-use planning The Spatial Planning Act, last amended in 2018, provides a national framework for spatial planning that seeks to balance the need for environmental protection with economic development and growth. Municipalities are responsible for translating national guidelines into concrete spatial planning (Figure 2.1). To this end, they issue municipal plans every four years with a 12-year time frame. Local plans are the most detailed level of spatial planning. They establish rules on how land can be used and developed (OECD, 2017[8]). MIBFA can reject municipal plans that do not adequately take national guidelines into account. Municipal plans must address climate adaptation needs and reflect the Green Map of Denmark (Box 2.4). A 2017 reform of the act gave municipalities more flexibility to promote growth and development with continued respect for nature and environment. One example is more flexible building opportunities in rural and coastal areas. Box 2.4. Green Map of Denmark Amendments to the Spatial Planning Act in 2015 and 2017 introduced requirements for municipalities to plan and designate existing and potential natural areas and wildlife corridors, including existing Natura 2000 sites, on the Green Map of Denmark. The aim of the map is to improve biodiversity by reinforcing efforts to establish larger and more interconnected natural areas and ensure coherence between designations in neighbouring municipalities. The map shows not only existing nature but also where there is a potential to create larger natural areas, such as forests and heaths. The map is continuously developed and expanded as municipalities review their municipal plans every four years. The Nature Map, a planning tool developed by the EPA and MEF, is available to municipalities to support their work on designating nature areas for the Green Map. It includes an overview of where endangered species are found and where efforts can be targeted, and provides information on important high nature value habitats and potential forest habitats.

Land-use planning framework Source: Adapted from (OECD, 2017[8]). Farmland takes up more than 60% of the country’s surface area. Farming puts pressure on the environment, especially on peatland (drained peatland is a net source of GHGs) or close to sensitive natural areas and water bodies. Since 1990, land consolidation and land banking have proved essential to improve both agricultural productivity (through structural adjustment) and nature conservation (by offsetting nature conservation land with agricultural land) (Hartvigsen, 2014[10]). However, public funding for land redistribution has been significantly reduced since the discontinuation of the structural adjustment policy in 2006. In 2018, a Multifunctional Land Redistribution Fund (MLRF) was established with a budget of EUR 33 million. In February 2019, Denmark’s two main environmental and agricultural interest groups jointly recommended raising it by at least EUR 130 million (Danish Society for Nature Conservation and Danish Agriculture & Food Council, 2019[11]). The aim is to be able to seize opportunities to buy land where farming has a Sectoral Plans General framework National Subordinate plans must conform Subordinate plans do not need to conform Primarily policy / strategic guidelines Primarily land-use plans Strategic and land-use guidelines Partial geographical coverage NATIONAL PLANNING -NATIONAL PLANNING REPORT (LANDSPLANREDEGØRELSE) -Provides national long-term directives and high-level objectives for spatial development -Prepared after each election by the Minister for Industry, Business and Financial Affairs -FINGER PLAN FOR COPENHAGEN -National Planning Directive that outlines the urban development of the greater Copenhagen area MUNICIPAL PLANS -KOMMUNEPLAN -Comprehensive small scale land-use plans -Also contain important strategic elements for the development of a municipality -Typical scale: 1:20 000 to 1:5 000 LOCAL PLANS -LOKALPLAN -Most detailed plans, determine how land may be developed and used -Created only for larger developments or when necessary to meet the intentions of the municipal plan -Typical scale: 1:10 000 to 1:1 000 NATURA 2000 PLAN -Outlines environmental conditions and objectives as specified in the EU Natura 2000 Directive -Has 246 sub-plans that contain sometimes detailed zoning regulations WATER RESOURCE PLAN STRATEGIES FOR PLANNING -PLANSTRATEGI -Can be exclusively focused on strategic land-use planning, but can also include more general municipal strategies for economic and social development Municipal I.2.

Conversion of peatland could reduce agricultural GHG emissions by some 15% through carbon sequestration (Dubgaard and Ståhl, 2018[12]). However, EU policies limit the potential. Farmers lose income support under the Common Agricultural Policy when agricultural peatland is converted to nature areas. In addition, the EU 2030 climate and energy framework caps how much member states can use carbon sequestration to meet reduction targets for sectors not included in the EU Emissions Trading System. Scaling up conversion of peatland would support Denmark’s ambition to become carbon neutral by 2050. It would also deliver co-benefits for biodiversity, water and air quality, and climate adaptation. However, the merit of scaling up public funding of the MLRF with respect to expected environmental policy benefits requires cost-effectiveness analysis. In addition to budgetary resources, private funds could be mobilised to finance the MLRF. Denmark has shown leadership in this area through the Climate Investment Fund. Recent OECD work illustrates the range of interventions public actors can use to attract institutional investment in low-carbon infrastructure, which could include the land purchase envisaged by the MLRF (Röttgers, Tandon and Kaminker, 2018[13]). 2.4. Policy evaluation framework The EU Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive was transposed into Danish law in 2004. The resulting Environmental Assessment Act, last amended in 2016, requires ministries to conduct SEAs of plans and programmes that may significantly affect the environment. Examples of SEAs conducted in the review period include a SEA of changes to the regulation of fertiliser use by farmers in the Food and Agriculture Package and a SEA of the choice of location of marine wind turbines following the 2012 Energy Agreement. The system of political agreements means a SEA is sometimes performed after a political decision is made, in which case implementation can be conditional on the SEA showing compatibility with legal constraints, e.g. EU environmental law. Important government plans and programmes typically rely on extensive prior assessment of the costs and benefits of targets or the cost-effectiveness of measures. Since many environmental targets in Denmark are set at EU level rather than nationally, cost-effectiveness assessments are more widely used than cost-benefit analysis. Nevertheless, MEF and other ministries have increased their efforts on cost-benefit analysis. In 2017, the Ministry of Finance published a revised set of guidelines on socio-economic assessment of the costs and benefits of major initiatives (MF, 2017[14]). The value of statistical life was increased from DKK 18 million (EUR 2.4 million) to DKK 31 million (EUR 4.2 million), making the benefits of air pollution measures, for instance, more likely to outweigh the costs. A recent example of a cost-benefit analysis is the government proposal to tighten restrictions on vehicles in green zones in the largest cities, which was included in the 2018 Climate and Air Pollution Proposal and approved later that year. In 2014, MEF tasked academics with preparing an ex ante cost-effectiveness analysis of possible measures in RBMPs for 2015-21 (DCA, 2014[15]). An inter-ministerial working group produced a similar analysis of possible GHG mitigation measures in 2013 (MEUC, 2013[16]), and potential GHG mitigation measures in the agricultural sector underwent analysis in 2018. Cost-effectiveness analysis was also performed in preparation of the 2013 108  I.2. ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 national waste plan and in 2013 and 2014 on implementation of the EU National Emission Ceilings Directive. In addition to effects within its borders, when conducting cost-benefit analysis of environmental policies Denmark should consider separately quantifying effects elsewhere, e.g. health benefits in neighbouring countries resulting from Danish air pollution measures. Quantifying effects in and outside Denmark separately would give politicians the information needed to evaluate policy options on a national or international basis, as they choose (OECD, 2018[17]). More generally, making use of the guidelines on socio-economic assessment mandatory for government decisions with a significant environmental impact could further strengthen policy making. However, the consequences for government decision-making processes should be assessed before such a change is implemented. Primary legislation (laws) must contain a regulatory impact assessment (RIA) covering the environment. The RIA must also assess economic and administrative burdens for companies and public authorities, and administrative burdens for citizens (PMO, 1998[18]). RIAs included in draft primary laws are released for consultation by the public before the bills are debated in Parliament, in line with OECD best practice (OECD, 2017[19]). However, Danish RIAs usually do not include comparison with alternative policy options, unlike European Commission RIAs, for example. They are typically less comprehensive than a full cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness analysis. Hence they could also benefit from mandatory use of the guidelines on socio-economic assessment. Finally, Denmark has one of the OECD’s largest gaps between the levels of impact assessment of primary legislation and of subordinate regulations (statutory orders). This may be because many statutory orders in Denmark are merely decrees of application of the primary law. In such cases, it may not be relevant to conduct an additional RIA (OECD, 2018[20]). Denmark conducts ex post evaluation of important policies, plans, programmes and political agreements. For example, an evaluation of the pesticide tax and reduction target was made public in 2018 (EPA, 2018[21]). Energy taxes and support under the 2012 Energy Agreement were also subject to extensive ex post evaluation. The findings fed into preparation of the 2018 Energy Agreement and led, for example, to a commitment to lower the electricity tax. The 2007 Environmental Performance Review recommended prioritising monitoring of national environmental action plans. This is now included in NOVANA. An independent body, Rigsrevisionen, audits public spending on behalf of the Danish Parliament. It audits government accounts and financial statements of publicly funded enterprises, and verifies the legality and efficient use of public funds. It also conducts in-depth studies of specific policy areas. Parliament may request a statement by the responsible minister on specific reports. The statement is then evaluated by Rigsrevisionen, which sends the evaluation to Parliament for review, thus ensuring follow-up and political accountability. Following a 2014 Rigsrevisionen report, Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee criticised the former Ministry of Environment for its management of the first RBMPs (2009-15). These were subject to delays and dissatisfaction concerning stakeholder involvement. Scrutinising the management of the second RBMPs (2015-21), Rigsrevisionen found that the ministry had followed its recommendations and proposed closing the case (Rigsrevisionen, 2018[22]). Independent advisory bodies such as the Environmental Economic Council and the Climate Council are also mandated to evaluate public policies ex post and to make ex ante I.2. ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT  109 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 recommendations with a strong focus on improving cost-effectiveness. The Environmental Economic Council was formed in 2007 to supplement the Economic Council. The two councils share the same four-person presidency of renowned economists, usually from the academic world. They prepare one report per year on policy issues at the interface of economics and the environment. The Environmental Economic Council, which consists of the presidency and a wide range of public sector and civil society representatives, meets to discuss and comment on the report. The Climate Council established by the 2014 Climate Act is an expert group charged with evaluating compliance with climate targets, analysing pathways for Denmark to become a low emission country by 2050, issuing recommendations on climate policy and mitigation measures, and contributing to the public debate. 2.4.1. Environmental impact assessment and permitting Under the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Act, last amended in 2017, EIA must be carried out on building and construction projects before the contractor is granted permission to begin the project. EIA is integrated into the permitting process. In 2015, the Environmental Protection Act and the Spatial Planning Act were amended to reduce processing times for environmental permits and ease the administrative burden for companies and authorities, while at the same time maintaining the stringency of environmental law. The amendments followed 2014 political agreements on a Growth Plan for Food and a Growth Package. The purpose of the latter was to reduce the time it takes the central government to process files for environmental approvals by 20% and municipal processing time by 33%. The government estimated that, from 2017, the time savings would represent an annual administrative gain of DKK 4.3 million (EUR 0.6 million) for industry and lead to an increase in turnover of DKK 61 million (EUR 8.2 million) per year due to enterprises starting new production more quickly. The Order on Environmental Permitting, last amended in 2018, covers some 4 400 companies. They must apply for an environmental permit before starting production or significantly changing or expanding their activities. Livestock farms are covered by a separate Order on Livestock Environmental Permitting. It takes into account risks regarding excess nutrients to groundwater, lakes and coastal waters and the adverse impact of ammonia emissions on protected areas, among other matters. 2.5. Compliance assurance 2.5.1. Environmental inspections Municipalities conduct most environmental inspections, using EPA guidelines. The EPA inspects the most complex companies with the most serious potential impact on the environment. These include energy plants, metal and mineral producers and processors, the chemical industry, shredder waste managers, landfills, hazardous waste managers, and incinerators (Statutory Order No. 1317 of 20/11/2018 on Environmental Permits). The EPA and municipalities jointly oversee imports of waste for treatment. The approximately 700 municipal inspectors in Denmark’s 98 municipalities conducted around 17 000 environmental inspections in 2017. Municipal inspectors are not accredited, but employed on the basis of their educational background and professional experience and trained through Local Government Denmark. MEF supports municipalities in their inspection and licensing tasks through its Project Digital Business, and organises briefings 110  I.2. ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 on EU reference documents on best available techniques. Some 50 EPA employees are responsible for permitting and inspection of 300 industrial sites covered by the Industrial Emissions Directive and about 30 sites covered by the Seveso Directive. They conduct 250 to 300 inspections per year. In 2010, MEF launched its second enterprise committee, whose work resulted in recommendations regarding simplification and updating of the corporate environmental regulatory system. The recommendations led to reorganisation of environmental inspections. Denmark now takes a risk-based approach to environmental inspection, in line with the Industrial Emissions Directive. It assigns a risk score to companies based on five parameters with differing weights: use of environmental management systems (20%), previous rule compliance (30%), storage of chemicals or other hazardous substances (16.5%), emissions to air, soil or water (16.5%) and proximity to environmentally sensitive areas (17%). The potentially most environmentally harmful companies are inspected at least every three years, as the directive requires, while the least potentially harmful are inspected at least every six years. In both cases, the frequency of inspection is increased if the companies’ risk score justifies it (Statutory Order No. 1476 of 12/12/2017 on Environmental Inspections). Applying a risk-based inspections system to even the least potentially harmful companies is good practice. In 2018, an external evaluation concluded that the risk score was generally effective but that certain aspects could be improved. Among its recommendations were differentiating between minor and major violations of rules when assessing the rule compliance parameter (Ramboll, 2018[23]). Until 2016, each municipality produced a yearly report on its environmental inspections, but these data were not systematically compiled at the national level. In 2016, Denmark introduced a central database collecting data from all inspections. This is a positive step, as it gives an overview of the total number of inspections and violations. In 2017, out of 7 106 inspections of the most potentially environmentally harmful companies, 3 054 violations were detected (Figure 2.2). Among 10 501 inspections of the least potentially harmful companies, 3 293 violations were detected. The share of companies violating environmental rules is not known, as several violations may be found in a single inspection. The numbers suggest that the Danish inspection system is effective. The risk-based approach helps authorities identify companies likely to breach environmental rules. The results also show that the companies posing the biggest potential risk to the environment are subject to the most compliance promotion and enforcement measures. Denmark is starting to use the database more strategically to improve its inspections efforts. From 2020, it plans to target guidance to industries where inspection data point to a need for special efforts to bring down the number of violations. Making fuller use of the database should help Denmark gain a better understanding of non-compliance among companies and inform policy making. I.2. ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT  111 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Figure 2.2. The inspection system is effective in finding violations, but the share of companies violating environmental rules is unknown StatLink 2http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888934002015 Denmark is introducing innovative techniques to support inspections. For example, in relation to sulphur pollution from ships leaving the Baltic Sea through Danish waters, it has started using sensors to single out ships for inspection (Box 2.5) Box 2.5. Monitoring sulphur pollution from ships crossing Danish waters To determine vessel compliance with international sulphur regulations, as outlined by the International Maritime Organization in MARPOL Convention Annex VI, Denmark runs controls on ships passing through its waters. The authorities monitor emissions from ship funnels using a sniffer installed on a helicopter or drone (a plane was formerly used), as well as one on the Great Belt Bridge. In 2017, between July and December alone, 404 ships were checked and a substantially elevated sulphur content was found in 22 of them (5.4%). This was the first time that micro-sensor technology, in the form of a mini sniffer system, was officially used. If too much sulphur is detected, the Danish Maritime Authority is informed and the ship is further checked at a Danish port, as oil samples are required as proof. Since 2015, 21 companies have been reported to the authorities, and 7 have been fined thus far. For ships heading to non-Danish ports, the EPA notifies the relevant authorities that there may be grounds for monitoring. It shares monitoring information with other EU countries via the THETIS port state control database, allowing EU and national authorities to act on the information. To strengthen enforcement of the sulphur regulations, in October 2018 the Danish environment minister presented a legislative proposal to Parliament that would allow the EPA to publicly “name and shame” non-complying companies. Note: The Danish EPA has communicated that even minor infractions, such as failing to register a required environmental improvement even though it has in fact been implemented, is considered a violation under the current inspection system. The fact that a recommendation has been issued does not mean that the company has violated environmental rules. It is rather a preventive measure intended to avoid future violations and/or improve environmental management.

Two subsequent reports concluded that some 95% of ships now respect the sulphur limits. Given that all ships entering or leaving the Baltic Sea need to pass through Danish waters, this monitoring, if supported by action by other countries in the region (e.g. in response to Danish authorities’ notifications), can be considered a best practice contributing to the improvement of air quality in the region.

Enforcement and environmental liability Danish authorities have three categories of compliance promotion and enforcement measures at their disposal: reporting companies to the police, issuing enforcement orders prescribing corrective actions and issuing non-binding recommendations. If authorities detect violations during an inspection, they must issue an enforcement order. In the most severe cases, they report companies to the police. However, this occurred in just 30 cases out of some 17 600 inspections in 2017. As a preventive measure, authorities may issue recommendations to help companies improve environmental management and avoid future violations. These can take the form of non-binding agreements on specific improvements. Guidance documents on compliance promotion and enforcement measures have existed since 2005 (EPA, 2005[27]), but in practice, municipalities vary widely in their use of the measures. In 2017, recommendations made up 21.5% of reactions recorded following inspections of the potentially most environmentally harmful companies (Figure 2.3). However, 11% of municipalities opted for a more instructive (less punitive) approach by choosing to use recommendations more often than enforcement orders. Eight of these municipalities issued recommendations five times more often than enforcement orders. Figure 2.3. Municipalities enforce environmental rules differently Different types of industries are not evenly distributed across the country.

ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT  113 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 not be an aim in itself. However, the same types of companies should experience uniform treatment irrespective of the municipality they are based in. To thus level the playing field for companies, national authorities should ensure that municipalities promote compliance with environmental rules and enforce them in a comparable manner, while respecting municipal autonomy and taking differences in the regional distribution of industries into account (Mazur, 2011[28]). In 2017, MEF launched a new enforcement strategy for its agencies, including the EPA (MEF, 2017[29]). It includes scaling up guidance efforts and ensuring transparent and uniform treatment of companies. The results of this strategy should be used to provide municipalities with additional, evidence-based criteria for identifying appropriate compliance promotion and enforcement measures. In addition, the EPA could illustrate its guidance documents with examples from actual cases in municipalities. Section 196 of the Danish Penal Code makes it a crime to pollute air, water, soil or the underground to such an extent that the pollution causes significant damage or immediate danger of damage to the environment. It is also a crime to store or remove waste or similar substances where it causes significant damage or immediate danger of damage to the environment. Violations of environmental law of a systematic or organised nature are also considered crimes. The most severe penalty for an environmental crime given during the review period was in a case decided by the Danish High Court in 2017. Two men were sentenced, one to three years in prison and the other to three years and nine months, for crimes including disposal of waste in a forest in violation of paragraph 196 of the Criminal Code. However, criminal liability is reserved for the most serious breaches of environmental law. In less serious cases, Denmark applies the polluter-pays principle, requiring the polluter to bear the cost of remedying the environmental damage. Denmark transposed the EU Environmental Liability Directive in 2008 and has published a comprehensive guidance document on its application. It has not yet experienced any cases of environmental damage to which the directive applied. In 2016, the European Commission launched an investigation into whether Danish legislation was compatible with the directive. The context of violations of environmental rules differs between the most and least potentially harmful companies. Increasingly, the least potentially harmful companies are not required to have environmental permits but must comply with general rules. To promote their compliance, information measures in line with the inspection strategy might be useful. The most potentially harmful companies must have environmental permits, which give detailed guidance on how each company is to comply with environmental legislation. Nevertheless, more violations are found among these companies than among those without permits. This suggests that lack of guidance is not the underlying issue. Making fuller use of the database on inspections would help shed light on reasons for non-compliance. 2.5.3. Promotion of compliance and green practices (certification) The number of Danish companies adopting the ISO 14001 environmental management system was between 800 and 1 000 for most years in the review period (Figure 2.4). After a sharp peak in 2012, from 2013 to 2017 the yearly number increased gradually to reach its second highest level in 2017. An explanation for the fluctuation may be the impact of public support programmes that have promoted uptake of environmental management systems. 114  I.2. ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Figure 2.4. Enterprises adopting environmental management systems peaked in 2012 StatLink 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888934002034 Denmark does not have an Environmental Code but is attempting to make compliance with environmental legislation easier. To this end, a simplification exercise is being undertaken to reduce the number of regulations related to the environment and food production. It is intended to be a technical legal reorganisation exercise that will not alter existing environmental protection. The aim is to improve legal certainty for citizens and companies by consolidating the relevant legislation and organising it more logically, which will also ease the administrative burden for public authorities. As a first step, MEF reorganised and merged statutory orders and annulled orders that were no longer applicable. When that exercise was finished in 2016, the number of orders had been reduced by a third without changing the legal stringency of environmental protection. As a second step, a panel of legal experts in the environmental field, chaired by the ombudsman’s office of the Danish Parliament, were tasked with proposing a new structure for laws covering the environment and food production. The panel published its recommendations in December 2017 under the title “The Law Compass”. It recommended a simplified and modernised legal structure that would reduce the number of laws from 95 to 43 without changing the level of environmental protection (Law Compass Expert Panel, 2017[30]). Initial steps to follow up on these recommendations have been taken, such as repeal of obsolete rules on agriculture. Denmark should further pursue such efforts in order to promote compliance and enforcement. 2.5.4. Voluntary agreements Governments sometimes use voluntary agreements with business as an alternative or supplement to other policy instruments (e.g. direct environmental regulation, taxes, tradable emission permits), as they are thought by some to be more flexible, efficient or consensus-based. However, if voluntary agreements are not backed by a credible threat of more restrictive action should targets not be met, they risk adding little value while incurring administrative costs for both authorities and companies (OECD, 2003[31]). Denmark’s use of agreements and formalised partnerships between the public and private sectors on the environment reflects a tradition of civil-society involvement in policy 0 200 400 600 800 1 000 1 200 1 400 1 600 1 800 2 000 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Number of ISO 14001 EMS certifications issued per year, 2005-17 Source: ISO (2018), ISO Survey 2017.\nI.2.

Such arrangements also help create consensus and continuity on environmental policies, a preference reflected in the system of informal cross-party political agreements as well. When voluntary agreements include quantitative targets, they are backed by explicit threats of regulatory action (Table 2.2). Table 2.2.

Promoting environmental democracy 2.6.1. Public participation Denmark provides for excellent public participation in environmental matters, according to the European Commission (EC, 2017[32]). Across policy areas, the OECD regulatory policy and governance indicator shows Denmark to be slightly above the OECD average in terms of stakeholder engagement in development of legislation (OECD, 2017[19]). Stakeholder engagement is more comprehensive in primary legislation (laws) than in subordinate regulations (statutory orders). This follows the same pattern as EIA, possibly because some statutory orders are simply application decrees of primary laws. The government aims to have four weeks of public consultation on both primary laws and statutory orders, although it is not a legal requirement. The aim is generally respected on primary laws and, when practical, on statutory orders. 2.6.2. Access to environmental information The Environmental Information Act, last amended in 2017, constitutes Denmark’s implementation of the EU Directive on Public Access to Environmental Information, which in turn implements part of the UNECE Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (the Aarhus Convention). Access to environmental information, to which the act applies, is broader in scope than access to other types of information, which is covered by the Open Administration Act. The definition of environmental information covers the state of the environment; elements such as substances, energy, noise, radiation, waste, emissions and leaks that cause or may cause pollution; policies, legislation, plans, programmes and agreements affecting the environment; reports on implementation of environmental legislation; economic analyses on environmental policy measures; and human health and safety, including the effects of pollution (Statutory Order No. 980 of 16/08/2017). The time in which authorities must handle requests for information ranges between one to two and forty workdays, depending on the complexity of the request. 116  I.2. ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 The Open Administration Act requires national, regional and local authorities to communicate actively about their activities on their websites. Every four years, MEF issues an Environmental Status Report on Denmark’s nature and the environment. The latest such report was issued in 2015. In November 2018, Danish authorities said they expected the next Environmental Status Report to be published in 2019. NOVANA makes national monitoring data available to the public on environmental impacts, status and trends with regard to nature and the environment. Aarhus University publishes a yearly summary of these technical documents as a more accessible supplement. 2.6.3. Access to justice For most of the review period, the Environment and Nature Appeal Board was an independent authority examining appeals against administrative decisions on environment, nature and spatial planning. On 1 February 2017, the board’s responsibilities were split between a new Environment and Food Appeal Board for environment and nature and a separate body for spatial planning appeals. The structure mirrors the division of responsibilities between MEF and MIBFA. An Energy Appeal Board also exists. The Environment and Food Appeal Board is now the top administrative appellate body for decisions made under MEF. Its membership consists of a president, judges nominated by courts, experts nominated by relevant non-government organisations and business associations; and lay members nominated by Parliament. The composition of the panel examining a given appeal depends on the nature of the appeal, but the president and judges are members of all panels. The president may decide on behalf of the board in cases that do not raise questions of major importance or precedence. A plaintiff unsatisfied with a board decision may appeal it through the regular court system. In an effort to provide speedier access to justice for citizens, the average number of days taken for board decisions was reduced from 369 in 2011 to 182 in 2015 (Figure 2.3). In 2016, the progress was partly reversed because of adjustments related to relocation of the board from Copenhagen to Viborg. Table 2.3.

An ombudsman’s office was established in 1955 as an independent legal institution under Parliament to which citizens can file complaints against decisions by public authorities. The ombudsman is elected by Parliament and must be a law graduate. The ombudsman may proffer criticism and recommend that authorities reopen cases and consider changing their decisions. Although the ombudsman cannot make decisions as such, public authorities generally act on the office’s recommendations. The ombudsman has issued opinions on authorities’ application of the Environmental Information Act, sometimes recommending expansion of its application in specific cases. I.2. ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT  117 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 2.6.4. Environmental education Danish authorities use information campaigns to raise public awareness of environmental issues. In recent years, initiatives have been taken to help schools educate children and youth on environmental issues. The EPA offers educational material on nature on its website (Denmark, 2018[33]). The material is differentiated for all levels of basic education (grades 0 to 9). In grades 4 to 6, the focus is on spreading knowledge of different types of nature. In grades 8 and 9, more difficult concepts are introduced, such as biodiversity and trade-offs between species habitats and human activities. A green think tank, Concito, has received support from the education ministry to develop a digital learning platform called Sustainable 2.0. It offers material on the Sustainable Development Goals, renewable energy sources, sustainable cities, climate change and consumption patterns (Concito/Klimaambassaden, 2018[34]). The education and environment ministries and the Danish Agriculture & Food Council have jointly produced material for students on food waste that aims to raise awareness and give students practical tools to limit food waste (ME, 2018[35]). Recommendations on environmental governance and management Supporting the institutional framework  Expand the use of task forces to build municipal capacity in the areas of environmental management where they face challenges, such as waste prevention.  Further strengthen guidance to municipalities on implementation of environmental legislation to make it easier to use, as Switzerland does with its enforcement aids to cantons. Making land use more sustainable  Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of scaling up land acquisition and redistribution of environmentally valuable agricultural land through the MLRF. Strengthening policy evaluation framework  (OECD, 2017[8])Consider making socio-economic impact assessment (SEIA) mandatory for government policy decisions with a significant environmental impact, including in the context of RIA, based on the 2017 SEIA guidelines.  Consider separately quantifying effects in other countries when conducting cost-benefit analyses of Danish environmental policies, e.g. health benefits in neighbouring countries resulting from Danish air pollution measures. Promoting and ensuring compliance  While respecting municipal autonomy, create a level playing field for companies by ensuring that municipalities apply compliance promotion and enforcement measures based on well-established and similar criteria; in particular, update the EPA compliance promotion and enforcement guidance documents with factual findings from the enforcement strategy and concrete examples from municipalities. 118  I.2. ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019  Continue efforts to make fuller use of the Danish Environmental Administration database on environmental inspections to gain better understanding of non-compliance among companies and to inform policy making.  Pursue efforts to simplify environmental legislation to further promote compliance and enforcement.

It analyses the use of taxation and other pricing instruments to pursue environmental objectives, and advances in eliminating environmentally harmful subsidies. The chapter also examines spending on environmental protection, investment in low-carbon energy and transport infrastructure and services, and promotion of green growth and eco-innovation as sources of growth and employment.

TOWARDS GREEN GROWTH OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 3.1. Introduction Denmark’s small, open economy is doing well, with robust gross domestic product (GDP) growth since 2015, although slow productivity growth remains a challenge (OECD, 2019[1]). The 5.8 million inhabitants enjoy high income levels and living standards, low unemployment rates and extensive welfare benefits, and have generally strong environmental awareness. The country’s history of ambitious environmental and energy policy goals contributed to the decoupling of greenhouse gas (GHG) and air pollutant emissions and other environmental pressures from economic activity (Chapter 1). Good progress has already been made against the target to decarbonise the economy by 2050, especially in the energy sector. The commitment to address environmental challenges and economic success associated with the export of clean technology, notably renewable energy resources, made Denmark a front runner in green growth. This chapter assesses Denmark’s progress in integrating environmental considerations into economic policy and promoting green growth, focusing on the period since 2005. It analyses the use of taxation and other pricing instruments to pursue environmental objectives, along with advances in eliminating environmentally harmful subsidies. The chapter examines spending on environmental protection, investment in low-carbon energy and transport infrastructure and services, and promotion of green growth and eco-innovation as sources of growth and employment. It also analyses the international dimension of Denmark’s environmental policy, particularly the inclusion of environmental issues in development co-operation programmes and in trade. 3.2. Action framework for sustainable development and green growth Having played a leadership role in the development of the 2030 Agenda, Denmark aims to spearhead implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Its Action Plan for Implementation of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs, adopted in March 2017, includes 37 targets supported by national indicators. Progress reports are made public and sent to Parliament annually, and are to be complemented every four years by more comprehensive status reports that also cover policy measures. Denmark was among the first countries to conduct a voluntary national review on progress towards the SDGs, in 2017, and committed to conduct two more reviews by 2030 (MOF, 2017[2]). The review was supported by publication of the first indicator report, largely based on readily available data and indicators. Statistics Denmark aims to broaden the statistical base for future reports to facilitate comparison of progress with international measurement frameworks. Harmonisation of statistics is a key issue, as only one-third of the indicators are currently comparable with those of other EU and OECD countries. Green growth ranks high on the political agenda and is anchored in strategic policy documents and cross-party political agreements. The 2009 Green Growth Agreement establishes a long-term strategy for environmental policy in the agricultural and food industries. The Energy Agreement for 2012-20 set ambitious targets to decarbonise the energy sector, which were confirmed in the Energy Agreement for 2020-24, adopted in June 2018. This includes the goal to achieve 100% green electricity by 2030 and net zero emissions economy-wide by 2050. It was complemented in 2018 by a climate and air proposal addressing emissions outside the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), such as in transport and agriculture. The overarching framework to achieve a low-carbon society was already set by the 2014 Climate Change Act. Some municipalities set local low-carbon I.3. TOWARDS GREEN GROWTH  125 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 targets and strategies. The capital city, Copenhagen, for example, aims to become carbon neutral as soon as 2025, though this target will be difficult (and more costly than expected) to achieve (Politiken, 2019[3]). The government has recently increased the emphasis on cost-effectiveness of green growth measures, ensuring they are beneficial to employment and competitiveness, on the one hand, and environmental and climate concerns on the other. The 2018 Energy Agreement, for example, aims to expand renewables on market conditions and to reduce costly subsidies. At the same time, subsidies for some technology, as well as tax concessions to businesses, remain in place, reducing overall cost-effectiveness (Sections 3.3 and 3.5). Denmark has chosen to make significant use of flexibility mechanisms to achieve its ambitious mitigation goal for non-EU ETS sectors: land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) credits and cancellation of EU ETS quotas (Chapter 1). The agricultural sector, which accounts for 20% of total GHG emissions, remains without direct regulation or taxation, which Denmark justifies because of high price competition and limited availability of cost-effective mitigation technology in the sector (Box 3.1). However, continued investment in research and cost-benefit calculations of emission reduction options in agriculture are called for, especially in view of a recent announcement by the Danish food industry that it aims to become carbon neutral by 2050 (DFAC, 2019[4]). Social cost-benefit analysis has long been used for decision making in sectors such as energy and transport. Its use has been more limited in the environment sector, but has increased in recent years. The Ministry of Finance has published guide values to estimate the benefits of environmental improvements in such analysis, which has helped enhance transparency and consistency across studies. The ministry also increased the recommended value for statistical life to be used in cost-benefit analysis, bringing it closer to values cited in the related OECD meta-analysis (OECD, 2012[5]). As noted in Chapter 2, policy making in Denmark benefits from regular engagement of stakeholder and expert groups, such as the Environmental Economic Council, which examines environment-economy links and environmental policy efficiency, and the Climate Council, which advises on how to become a low-carbon economy by 2050. An SDG Council was established in 2018. In May 2018, the government set up a “growth team” of business leaders to develop recommendations on better framework conditions for business opportunities related to the green transition, notably regarding green energy and environmental technology and digitisation. In early 2018, Statistics Denmark published a comprehensive report on green national accounting (SD, 2018[6]). Developed over three years, the initiative aimed at developing a green national accounting framework. The report gives an overview of recent developments and resulting environmental pressures, the state and trends of natural capital stock and the contribution of green activities to the economy. Some indicators under this framework are directly linked to the SDGs. A follow-up project with the University of Copenhagen is to further develop green national accounting, including an environment-adjusted GDP. With stable funding, this work could become the basis for a permanent green growth monitoring framework. Development of an environmental-economic macroeconomic model is also planned, to better forecast interaction between economic activity and the environment. 126  I.3. TOWARDS GREEN GROWTH OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Box 3.1. Climate mitigation in Danish agriculture Agriculture accounts for 20% of GHG emissions in Denmark (Chapter 1). Emissions have slightly declined since 2005, mostly through efficiency gains in production and efforts to limit nitrate pollution of water bodies. Denmark does not directly regulate agricultural emissions, citing limited availability of cost-effective mitigation technology and high price competition in the sector, as well as carbon leakage concerns. Ex ante evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of GHG mitigation measures in agriculture revealed that between 13% and 26% of the sector’s emissions could be reduced by 2030 (Dubgaard and Ståhl, 2018[7]). Converting highly organic soil, such as peatland, to nature areas was found to have by far the largest mitigation potential at relatively low cost. Other options were increased biogas production, sustainable slurry management, changes in livestock feed and the addition of chemicals to fertilisers and slurry (Table 3.1). The findings were broadly consistent with international estimates of mitigation potential in agriculture. Costs estimates for such mitigation measures range from DKK 273 (EUR 37) to DKK 1 588 (EUR 213) per tonne of CO2 equivalent (t CO2 eq). This is more costly than climate action in the energy and industrial sectors, which are mostly covered by the EU ETS (the price of allowances in the EU ETS have been around EUR 20 per tonne of CO2 since mid-2018). But it is below the estimated cost of further emission reductions in the transport sector, where taxes already impose a relatively high implicit carbon price (DEC, 2018[8]). It is important to note that most measures evaluated have considerable co-benefits on water or air quality (Table 3.1). The Danish Economic Council (2018[8]) found that marginal mitigation costs in agriculture were negative up to 0.8 MtCO2 eq thanks to co-benefits. Despite transport’s higher mitigation cost, the government has prioritised climate action in that sector, in particular through a goal of phasing out sales of fossil fuel-based cars. Denmark has begun to expand catch crops, introduce slurry acidification and convert organic soil. However, it has decided not to pursue reduced fertiliser use as a mitigation measure, which studies had found to have great mitigation potential (MCEB, 2013[9]). Resources have been earmarked for research and development (R&D) in agriculture mitigation as well as carbon capture, use and storage (Section 3.6.1). Table 3.1.

I.3. TOWARDS GREEN GROWTH  127 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 3.3. Greening the system of taxes, charges and prices 3.3.1. Overview Denmark’s public finances are strong, known for mostly close to balanced budgets and low public debt (50% of GDP in 2017; Basic statistics). The fiscal balance was in deficit during the global financial crisis and prolonged recovery, as fiscal policy supported demand, but it has improved in recent years. The government’s medium-term economic plan envisages structural balance after 2020. The tax burden is high by international comparison. Denmark ranked second among OECD countries for tax/GDP ratio in 2017 (46%, compared with the OECD average of 34%), due in part to high personal income tax. The government aims to lower the tax burden, however. Several tax cuts have contributed to a 2.5 percentage point decline in the tax/GDP ratio since 2014. Nearly three-quarters of tax revenue is collected by the central government and the rest by local governments (OECD, 2018[10]). Denmark has a long history of applying environmentally related taxes, being among the front-runners in integrating environmental considerations into its tax system. Many taxes align closely with the estimated external cost of production or consumption activities. Environmentally related tax revenue has been declining, though at 3.7% of GDP in 2017 it is still the highest value among OECD countries and more than twice the OECD average (1.6% of GDP in 2016) (OECD, 2018[11]). Revenue declined considerably during the 2008-09 financial crisis, mostly because vehicle tax revenue fell due to deductions for fuel-efficient cars introduced in 2007; the level stayed relatively constant in the following years (Figure 3.1). As in most OECD countries, energy-related taxes account for the largest share of tax revenue. Yet Denmark differs from other countries in its large taxes on vehicles. Taxes on pollution and natural resource use account for a small share of total green tax revenue, although the level is higher than in many other OECD countries. Figure 3.1.

TOWARDS GREEN GROWTH OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 3.3.2. Taxes on energy products and carbon pricing Denmark has a long history of energy taxation and carbon pricing, being one of the first countries to introduce a carbon tax (1992) and pioneering CO2 emission trading for the power sector (2000). Taxes on energy products accounted for 2.2% of GDP in 2016, one of the highest levels in the OECD (OECD, 2018[11]). The following are the main taxes on the use of energy products (OECD, 2018[12]):  Energy duty (52% of energy-related tax revenue in 2017): applies to fossil fuel use (oil products, natural gas, coal, coke and fossil waste) at rates that depend on the fuel’s energy content and on user category. In line with the recommendation in the 2007 OECD Environmental Performance Review of Denmark, rates are now indexed for inflation.  CO2 tax (8%): applies to fossil fuel use (oil products, natural gas, coal and coke), at rates that depend on the fuel’s carbon content. Rates are the same for most users, at DKK 173/t CO2 (EUR 23) in 2018, and indexed for inflation.  Electricity tax (28%): is levied on electricity output (per MWh). Tax rates vary widely by purpose and user group. Fuels used to generate electricity are not taxed. Other taxes on energy use include a tax on fossil waste1 and taxes on emission of SOX (for energy products containing more than 0.05% sulphur) and NOX from fuel combustion (Section 3.3.4). A Public Service Obligation (PSO) tax on electricity use was introduced in 2012 to generate resources for renewables subsidies, but it was decided in 2016 to phase it out over 2017-21. Taxes on energy products The tax burden resulting from energy taxes varies widely across fuels, users and purposes. As in most OECD countries, transport fuels are taxed at the highest effective rate (Figure 3.2). Yet Denmark also has one of the OECD’s highest effective tax rates on energy use in non-road sectors (OECD, 2018[13]). This is explained by relatively high tax rates on electricity and other energy use in the residential and commercial sectors. Industry and agriculture face a considerably lower tax burden due to reductions and exemptions. The electricity tax for industry (i.e. production processes), for example, was set at DKK 4 (EUR 0.54) per MWh in 2019, just above the EU minimum and about 200 times below the ordinary electricity tax applicable to households (DKK 884 or EUR 119/MWh). The large disparity in energy tax rates creates unequal incentives for energy savings, and is not justified from an environmental perspective. The energy tax burden on industry (e.g. energy tax revenue as a share of industry’s gross value added) declined from 1.5% in 2004 to 0.8% in 2016 (MIBFA, 2018[14]), increasing the scope for adjustment. Electricity taxes for households are the highest in the EU (EC, 2018[15]). While historically high taxes have encouraged power savings, their justification diminishes as power generation becomes cleaner. They also interfere with the cap in the EU ETS2 and discourage switching towards efficient solutions for electric heating (e.g. heat pumps and electric boilers) or electric vehicles, and create incentives for self-generation of power (e.g. with individual rooftop photovoltaic systems), even where socio-economically inefficient (IEA, 2017[16]). The government has taken steps to address this issue. It has reduced the electricity tax for heating (both for households and businesses) to DKK 259 (EUR 35) per MWh and plans to differentiate the tax on electricity used for electric vehicles. The phase-out of the PSO levy will reduce overall electricity prices and the 2018 Energy Agreement announced a gradual reduction in the standard electricity tax to I.3. TOWARDS GREEN GROWTH  129 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 DKK 774/MWh (EUR 104/MWh) by 2025. This will help increase the attractiveness of electric heating and mobility vis-à-vis fossil fuel- and biomass-based solutions. Unfortunately, the Energy Agreement also lowers the rate for some businesses to the minimum set for industrial processes, contributing to disparity among users. The change aims to equalise rates among businesses. Figure 3.2.

An open question is how to finance the reforms. Energy taxes are an important source of budget revenue, accounting for 5% of total tax revenue in 2016. Energy-related tax revenue has fallen by 11% since 2005 in real terms. The decline was driven by reductions in revenue from the CO2 tax and the energy duty on petrol and natural gas, which in turn reflected declining consumption of fossil fuels and associated CO2 emissions. Revenue will likely continue to fall with the projected decline in fossil fuel consumption, the phase-out of the PSO tax and reductions in the electricity tax. The government is considering temporarily increasing energy taxes or establishing a new temporary energy tax to finance the shortfall. Reducing the gap between industrial processes, heating purposes and other uses and/or taxing biomass could help in this respect. Solid biomass, which is exempt from the energy duty and CO2 tax, has gained in importance as a source for domestic and district heating. It use has more than doubled since 2005 and it accounted for 58% of renewables in 2017 (IEA, 2019[17]). While the use of biomass helps in meeting renewables targets, the assumption that it is carbon neutral from a lifecycle perspective has increasingly been challenged in the scientific literature (OECD, 2018[18]). In Denmark, 43% of consumed biomass is imported, primarily from Estonia and Latvia, making it even more difficult trace the fuel’s sustainability and carbon neutrality. The burning of biomass also creates significant air pollution (Chapter 1). The favourable tax treatment for biomass should therefore be reconsidered. Energy utilities have put in place 130  I.3. TOWARDS GREEN GROWTH OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 a voluntary programme to ensure sustainable use of biomass, which includes sustainable management of the forests from which the biomass is derived. Petrol is taxed significantly more heavily than diesel, at DKK 4.561 (EUR 0.61) per litre compared to DKK 3.104 (EUR 0.42) per litre of diesel. The tax gap between the two fuels is one of the largest in the OECD and increased over 2012-15. This is regrettable from an environmental perspective, as diesel combustion emits more CO2 and local air pollutants than an equivalent volume of petrol. In addition, a litre of diesel normally allows more kilometres to be driven, meaning the tax on it should be higher to internalise driving-related externalities (Harding, 2014[19]). Road transport fuels are taxed at an effective rate (i.e. when considering both energy taxes and the carbon tax) that is comparable to average OECD levels but lower than in other Scandinavian countries and neighbouring Germany (OECD, 2018[13]). To address the diesel-petrol gap, Denmark levies an annual countervailing charge on diesel cars (Section 3.3.3). The rationale is that a direct increase in diesel tax rates might encourage fuel tourism to neighbouring countries. However, as an annual tax that is not linked to vehicle use, it is less efficient way of addressing externalities. In addition, end-user prices for diesel are lower than in Sweden and Norway, although indeed higher than in Germany (IEA, 2018[20]). In any case, the countervailing charge failed to balance the lower diesel tax: both the sale of diesel vehicles and diesel consumption increased, with the share of diesel cars in the passenger fleet jumping from 10% to 31% over 2005-17 (DRD, 2018[21]). Denmark would benefit from phasing out the reduced energy duty for diesel, especially if it co-ordinated with similar moves in neighbouring countries. Pricing carbon emissions from energy use The carbon tax was introduced in 1992 for households and space heating in industry and has since been increased and extended to other uses. In 2008, Denmark raised the tax from DKK 25 to DKK 150 (which was the expected price of allowances in the EU ETS) and later indexed it to inflation. In 2018, the rate was DKK 173.2/tCO2 (EUR 23/tCO2), lower than in neighbouring Sweden, Norway and Finland. It should be noted, however, that Denmark levies higher excise taxes on some energy uses, such as transport fuels and residential energy use, which raises the implicit price of carbon. As explained above, energy excise duties – and thus the implicit price of carbon – vary significantly by user group, creating unequal incentives for CO2 emission reductions. In addition, industrial processes benefit from a reduction of the CO2 tax (IEA, 2017[16]). In addition to putting a price on carbon via taxes, Denmark participates in the EU ETS. In 2017, 34% of Danish GHG emissions were subject to carbon pricing through this system. EU ETS installations are exempt from the carbon tax, or receive a full refund, to avoid double taxation; the exceptions are incinerators (Chapter 4) and heat inputs for district heating plants. The OECD estimates that, accounting for energy taxes and the EU ETS, 78% of CO2 emissions from energy use in Denmark faced a price signal in 2015, albeit at a relatively low level (the remaining emissions largely stem from combustion of biomass, which is not taxed). Only 32% of CO2 emissions faced a price above EUR 30/tCO2 in 2015, which is a low-end estimate of climate damage. In contrast to a generally rising price signal in the OECD, the share of CO2 emissions priced at or above EUR 30 in Denmark has dropped from 52% in 2012 (OECD, 2018[18]). This is likely due to higher (untaxed) biomass consumption and lower energy tax rates for industry. As a result, the economy-wide carbon pricing gap increased from 40% in 2012 to 52% in 2015 (Figure 3.3). I.3. TOWARDS GREEN GROWTH  131 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Figure 3.3. Denmark ranks about average in pricing of carbon emissions from energy use StatLink 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888934002072 3.3.3. Transport taxes and charges Vehicle taxes Vehicle taxes consist of a one-off duty on purchase (the registration tax), an annual ownership duty (commonly called the green owner tax)3 and the countervailing charge for diesel vehicles. Added to this is a tax on car insurance premiums. While taxes for passenger cars have been reduced several times in recent years, they remain high by international comparison, mostly due to a high registration tax. They also appear high with respect to transport-related externalities (DEC, 2018[8]). Taxation of lorries, buses and trucks, by contrast, is relatively light. High vehicle taxes discourage car purchases, resulting in a relatively low vehicle ownership rate and slow fleet renewal. The average passenger car is 8.9 years old, above the EU average of 7.4 years (EEA, 2018[22]). At the same time, the high registration tax (which is based on vehicle value) has encouraged purchases of cheaper vehicles, which tend to be small and more fuel efficient. In addition, both the registration tax and the green owner tax are linked to fuel efficiency.4 This combination had a significant impact on consumer choice, with higher sales of smaller and more energy-efficient cars that emit less CO2 per kilometre. Average emissions from new cars have been below the EU average in the past decade (IEA, 2018[23]). The exemption of lorries from the registration tax and reduced annual tax rates on cars and vans used for commercial purposes are not justified from an environmental perspective and should be reconsidered. Shifting the tax burden from car ownership to the use of vehicles and roads would enhance transport taxation efficiency (OECD, 2019[24]). Some progress has been made in this direction. In 2017, the registration tax was reduced to 85% of vehicle list price for the first DKK 185 000 (about EUR 25 000) from 105% of list price for the first DKK 106 000 (about EUR 14 000), while the annual vehicle tax was increased. The remainder is taxed at 150%, still high by international comparison.

TOWARDS GREEN GROWTH OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 measures targeting the externalities of car use, care must be taken to avoid cutting average car prices to the point of stimulating car sales and outweighing emission reduction benefits. The number of cars on the streets has grown continuously since 2010 (Chapter 1). The countervailing charge that diesel car owners must pay aims to offset the difference in energy duty between diesel and petrol (MT, 2015[25]) but has not slowed the increase in diesel car sales. For normal diesel cars, the countervailing charge is calculated as the estimated tax saving from using diesel instead of petrol for 22 000 km annually. In addition, since 2010, a surcharge of DKK 1 000 (EUR 134) has been applied to diesel cars and new commercial vehicles (registered after March 2009) not fitted with particulate filters. Diesel buses pay a fixed countervailing charge of DKK 1 230 (EUR 165) per year and trucks and tractors are exempt. This exemption is not justified from an environmental perspective and should be reconsidered. Overall, taxation of trucks fails to internalise their external environmental costs. To promote sales of electric and hydrogen vehicles, they were exempt from the registration and green owner taxes until 2015. The government aimed to phase in a registration tax for such cars (20% in 2016, 40% in 2017, 65% in 2018, 90% in 2019 and 100% in 2020), but this, coinciding with a general decrease in the registration tax, paralysed electric car sales (IEA, 2018[23]). The government thus decided to maintain the registration tax for electric vehicles at 20% for two additional years or until a threshold of 5 000 new registrations was reached. More recently, as part of the climate and air proposal, the government suggested imposing a registration tax for electric vehicles and hybrids with a list price of less than DKK 400 000 (EUR 54 000) in 2019 and 2020. This measure was adopted in late 2018 (see also Section 3.5.3). Road and congestion pricing Heavy vehicles and trucks with a permissible total weight of over 12 tonnes have to pay a road tax (Eurovignette) on motorways.5 Coaches are exempt. In addition, tolls apply on two major bridges: the Great Belt and Øresund. As part of the political agreement on lowering the registration tax, the government agreed to examine possibilities of introducing period-based tolls for passenger and vans from 2020 (MOT, 2017[26]). No details on implementation of such tolls have been released to date. Previous attempts to better internalise external environmental costs (e.g. through tolls per kilometre driven on certain roads) have been abandoned because they were considered very costly. Congestion pricing is not applied. Introducing dynamic congestion pricing, where tolls can be adjusted according to traffic conditions, in the most affected cities would reduce pollution, enhance infrastructure use and generate revenue. Plans to introduce a congestion tax in the capital, the city most affected by congestion, were replaced by an air quality protection plan to reduce PM10 and NO2 pollution. In February 2019, the government set up a consultative commission to study ways to reduce CO2 emissions from transport, giving it a mandate to consider road pricing and road tolls, among other measures, as alternative sources of revenue (MOF, 2019[27]). Company cars and commuting expenses As in most OECD countries, the employee benefit of being able to use a company-owned car (including for private purposes) is taxed less than cash wages. Harding (2014[28]) estimated that this favourable tax treatment created an annual subsidy of EUR 1 800 per company car, causing a tax revenue shortfall of about EUR 300 million in 2012 (compared to EUR 3 billion in revenue from vehicle-related taxes that year). Denmark’s system of I.3. TOWARDS GREEN GROWTH  133 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 company car taxation provides no incentive to choose efficient or less polluting vehicles. Company cars increase an employee’s annual taxable income by 25% of the vehicle’s listed value, irrespective of car type (unlike in Belgium, for example, which differentiates rates by CO2 emissions and fuel type). In a positive step, the government’s climate and air proposal would make it cheaper to choose electric cars for use as company cars. Employees who commute more than 24 km a day can deduct expenses related to commuting from their taxable income. The amount of deduction is calculated by applying a set rate to the distance travelled between home and workplace; the farther the employee lives from the workplace, the lower the deduction per kilometre travelled. There is no differentiation between forms of transport (unlike in Switzerland, for example, which allows deductions for private car use only in limited cases, a lump sum deduction for biking, and full deduction of public transport costs, providing an incentive to favour public transport and biking). Public transport costs paid by the employer are not treated as taxable income to the employee, increasing the attractiveness of public transport relative to other forms of commuting (including private car use), yet comparatively penalising lower-cost forms such as walking, biking and carpooling (Harding, 2014[28]). 3.3.4. Other economic instruments to limit pollution and resource use Air pollutants A tax on SOX emissions for products containing more than 0.05% sulphur was introduced in the mid-1990s. A tax on NOX emissions was introduced at DKK 5/kg in 2010. In 2012, the NOX tax was raised to DKK 25/kg (and the limit value for mandatory measurement reduced from 30 MW to 10 MW to cover more producers), but it was reduced back to DKK 5/kg in 2015. Both the SOX and NOX tax rates are below the respective external costs of these pollutants as acknowledged in the guideline values for cost-benefit analysis published by the Ministry of Environment and Food (MEF) (Andersen, 2018[29]). There is no specific tax rate for particulate matter or volatile organic compounds. Waste Denmark applies taxes on waste landfilling and incineration. The landfill tax, introduced in 1987, was increased in 2015 to DKK 475 per tonne from DKK 160/tonne in 2012-14 (MT, 2015[25]). The tax has helped reduce landfilling but had only limited effect on recycling rates. The incineration tax was converted in 2009 from a weight-based tax to one based on energy and CO2 content. The new system aims at providing a stronger incentive to recycle the most energy-intensive waste, such as plastics (Chapter 4). The tax is a combined input-output tax, charged at DKK 26.5 per GJ according to the energy content in the input waste and DKK 19.8 per GJ for heat output. Waste from biomass and processing of meat waste are exempted. An exemption for hazardous waste was abolished in 2010. Waste incineration for power and heat generation represents a large share of waste treatment in Denmark. Denmark also applies a volume-based packaging waste tax on several types of beverage containers that are not part of the deposit-return system, and on bags and disposable tableware (Chapter 4). A weight-based packaging tax was removed in 2014. Agricultural products Denmark is one of the few countries taxing pesticides. In 2013, the pesticide tax, which was introduced in 1996, was redesigned from a value-based tax to a quantity-based tax that 134  I.3. TOWARDS GREEN GROWTH OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 varies depending on human health hazard classification and the environmental impact of the pesticide: products with higher persistence, bioaccumulation or leaching to groundwater face higher rates. The generally higher tax rates and revenue were reimbursed to the agricultural sector (which accounts for more than 90% of pesticide use) through a reduction in the land value tax (GBE, 2014[30]). The change was made in a bid to reduce the pesticide load (a risk indicator) by 40% by 2015 from the 2011 level. Pesticide sales dropped significantly following the reform, partly because farmers stockpiled pesticides ahead of the reform (Chapter 5) (Eurostat, 2018[31]). A tax on mineral phosphorus added to animal feed was introduced in 2005 at a rate of DKK 4 per kg of phosphorus to encourage a switch to phytase so as to reduce the saturation of soil with phosphorus. Mineral phosphate use in animal feed has fallen by about 15% since the introduction of the tax, and phytase use has increased. The tax is thus believed to have improved overall efficiency in the use of animal feed (Andersen, 2016[32]). A new phosphorus regulation introduced in 2017 allows efficient feeding, for example using high doses of phytase, to meet requirements on phosphorous reductions. It has resulted in a stronger incentive to increase phytase and reduce mineral phosphorus use than the tax. To prevent double regulation, the tax was to be withdrawn in July 2019. Denmark pioneered construction of nutrient accounts at farm level. Agricultural nitrogen use has been partly regulated by a quota system, with allowable nitrogen consumption based on crop selection and soil type, among other criteria. Denmark recently adopted a new political agreement on more targeted regulation for agricultural nitrogen emissions, with targets based on geographical differences in watershed vulnerability and the soil’s ability to retain nitrogen (Chapter 1). The nutrient accounting system facilitates this new regulation paradigm. Since 2018, the nutrient accounting system has also been used to administer maximum allowable levels of phosphorus consumption at farm level. Water Denmark does not tax water resource abstraction but applies a tax on piped water at a rate of DKK 6.5 (EUR 0.9) per cubic metre. Most companies are exempt from the water tax (EEC, 2017[33]), implying that industry is in some sense cross-subsidised by households, which indeed face very high end-user prices (Section 3.5). Water supply plants must pay the tax on a minimum of 90% of water pumped, so if the plant has losses of more than 10%, it still pays on the balance of water lost. This rule, referred to as the water loss tax, creates an incentive for water companies to reduce leakage. A wastewater charge applies to all direct discharges from sources including industry, municipal wastewater treatment plants and individual households in the countryside. The tax is proportional to the pollution load and applies to nitrogen (DKK 30/kg), phosphorus (DKK 165/kg) and organic material (DKK 16.50/kg). The rate is uniform nationwide, whatever the quality objective or the diluting capacity of receiving waters. Utilities pass on the cost to households; direct dischargers pay it directly to authorities. Some industrial sectors, including fish processing, benefit from reductions of between 70% and 80% in this tax liability. A small part (less than 5%) of the revenue raised is earmarked for government mapping of groundwater and municipal action planning. I.3.

Fossil fuel subsidies The Ministry of Taxation reported total tax expenditure related to environment, energy and vehicles was DKK 12.1 billion (EUR 1.6 billion), or 25% of total tax expenditure in 2017 (MOT, 2018[34]). Table 3.2 provides a full breakdown of the expenditure. Several of the measures involved qualify as fossil fuel support: for instance, the exemption of agriculture from the energy duty; tax exemptions or deductions for shipping, aircraft and companies with heavy processes not covered by the EU ETS; and the lower diesel ownership tax for lorries, buses and tractors (for which there is no countervailing charge). The OECD Inventory of Fossil Fuel Support estimated total support to fossil fuel consumption at DKK 1.5 billion in 2017 (OECD, 2019[35]).6 This equals 0.15% of total tax revenue, below the OECD average support to fossil fuel consumption (0.5% of total tax revenue in 2016) (OECD, 2019[35]).

Source: MOT (2018), Tax Expenses: Total Level at the End of 2017. Until 2014, the OECD inventory listed another measure: the reduced energy duty for combined heat and power (CHP) generation. The Ministry of Taxation then decided to cease regarding this measure as tax expenditure.7 District heating customers pay a reduced energy duty for heat delivered from a CHP plant to discourage them from using other heating fuel, such as fuel oil. Tax revenue forgone due to this reduction has declined over time due to the increasing share of non-fossil heating sources (e.g. wood, straw), which are not subject to the energy duty. In 2014, revenue forgone from this measure reached DKK 5.7 billion (EUR 0.8 billion) (OECD, 2019[35]). 136  I.3. TOWARDS GREEN GROWTH OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 3.4.2. Agricultural support Arable land and cropland take up more than half of total land area, the highest share among OECD countries (OECD, 2019[36]). This puts pressure on the environment, especially where farming takes place on peatland or close to sensitive natural areas and water bodies. Farmers receive agricultural support under the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), mainly as direct payments for income support. The payments comprise a basic payment and additional payments, notably the so-called green payment provided if farmers diversify crops, maintain permanent grasslands and keep 5% of their land as ecological focus areas.8 Farmers also receive support through the Rural Development Programme (RDP), co-financed by Denmark and the EU, which finances individual projects on farms and/or activities in rural areas on the basis of economic, environmental or territorial priorities. Denmark has taken advantage of a flexibility mechanism to transfer part of the EU funds allocated to its farmers through direct payments into the RDP instead.9 Denmark built its RDP for 2014-20 around four focus areas: growth and competitiveness; organic farming; nature, environment and climate; and rural development. The organic farming and nature, environment and climate components received by far the largest volume in 2015-19 (Table 3.3). Such funding has supported expansion of organic farming (Chapter 1). Overall, three-quarters of payments have an environment-related objective, which represents DKK 1.1 billion (EUR 148 million) per year. There has been a relative shift in the RDP from supporting investment at farm level to organic farming and activities addressing nutrient pollution of the aquatic environment. The shift is partly to support the targeted approach to nitrogen regulation of farmers (Chapter 1). Spending on biodiversity purposes is more limited. Subsiding peatland conversion Conversion of peatland to wetlands or permanent grassland has considerable climate mitigation potential due to lower decomposition of soil carbon, with a potential to reduce agricultural GHG emission by about 15% (Dubgaard and Ståhl, 2018[7]). However, EU policies limit this potential, as farmers lose income support under the CAP when agricultural peatland is converted to nature areas. Moreover, the EU 2030 Climate and Energy Framework caps how much member states can use carbon sequestration to meet their reduction targets for non-EU ETS sectors. Under the RDP, Denmark subsidises farmers for conversion of peatland into permanent nature areas. DKK 65 million (EUR 9 million) was allocated to this purpose per year for 2016-19 (see “Rewetting of low-lying areas” in Table 3.3). In addition, Denmark set up a Multifunctional Land Redistribution Fund (MLRF) with a budget of EUR 20 million as part of the drought package for agriculture from 2018. The fund’s aim was to acquire and redistribute agricultural land where farming had a significant environmental impact and convert it to natural areas or grassland; examples include peatland and soil close to ammonia-sensitive nature areas or close to drinking water boreholes. In February 2019, Denmark’s two main environmental and agricultural interest groups jointly recommended increasing the MLRF by at least EUR 130 million to buy environmentally valuable agricultural land so as to support the target of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and deliver co-benefits for biodiversity, water and air quality, and climate adaptation (DN and DFAC, 2019[37]).

Source: Country submission. As this proposal requires substantial public funding, Denmark should evaluate the pilot phase before scaling up the fund. In the medium term, it should seek opportunities for complementing public funding with private resources to finance peat conversion subsidies or land acquisition under the MLRF. In addition to philanthropic payments, this could be 138  I.3. TOWARDS GREEN GROWTH OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 achieved by using peatland as carbon credits that could be purchased by parties that must offset their GHG emissions through voluntary or compliance markets. 3.5. Investing in the environment to promote green growth Infrastructure is a key element of any green growth strategy, with significant opportunity to improve environmental performance, boost economic growth and ensure resiliency to climate change. Denmark has modern and generally high-quality infrastructure. The World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report found the quality of Denmark’s infrastructure to be better than the European and North American averages (WEF, 2017[38]). Compared to its European peers, Denmark scores high with respect to road, port and air infrastructure, and in the mid-range for rail infrastructure (EC, 2018[39]). The latter is reflected in the fact that Denmark has one of the lowest shares of rail transport in inland freight in the EU (Chapter 1). It has considerable transit freight transport on its rail system: about 80% of the freight transported on its railways is in transit. The government has set up funds and earmarked resources for the green economy transition. For example, the Green Investment Fund was established in 2014 to co-finance commercially viable projects with a positive environmental impact. The state capital contribution was DKK 80 million (EUR 10.7 million), with a state-guaranteed lending limit of DKK 2 billion (EUR 268 million). The latter can be increased to DKK 5 billion (EUR 671 million) and the capital contribution to DKK 200 million (EUR 27 million). While most projects supported have concerned renewables or energy efficiency, the fund has more recently also supported bio-economy projects (e.g. production of alternative protein). The fund’s performance has not yet been evaluated. The Climate Investment Fund was established to support initiatives promoting Danish investment in developing and emerging economies’ green transitions (Section 3.7.2). The 2018 Energy Agreement earmarked new funding to support renewables development and energy efficiency, and the climate and air proposal announced new funding for mitigation options in agriculture and transport. 3.5.1. Expenditure for environmental protection Public environmental protection expenditure averaged around DKK 30 billion (EUR 4 billion) over the past decade.10 As in most OECD countries, expenditure is mostly directed towards waste management and wastewater treatment (Figure 3.4), provided by public corporations. General government expenditure mainly targets biodiversity and landscape protection, air and climate, as well soil and water protection. With a decline in expenditure on wastewater management, total public environmental protection expenditure was DKK 32.8 billion in 2017 (EUR 4.4 billion), or 1.5% of GDP, lower than in previous years (Figure 3.4). I.3. TOWARDS GREEN GROWTH  139 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Figure 3.4. Environmental expenditure remains relatively constant StatLink 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888934002091 Household expenditure on environmental protection services is the highest in the EU at 1.6% of total final consumption expenditure as of 2016 (Figure 3.4). This reflects high consumer tariffs for environmental services such as waste and wastewater treatment. These, in turn, may reflect high service quality and full cost recovery, but also inefficiency in service provision. In the waste sector, for example, waste collection costs decreased as most municipalities outsourced services. Now, however, municipalities increasingly want to go back to direct management and do not have to bid for competition with private companies, which does not help improve efficiency (Chapter 4). 3.5.2. Investment in renewables and energy efficiency Renewable energy resources Denmark has experienced a boom in renewables over the last decade: they now account for around one-third of primary energy supply and almost two-thirds of electricity generation (Chapter 1). This growth, which was particularly strong for wind and biomass, has been driven by strong and broad political will at the local and national levels, targeted support policies and community-based engagement (IEA, 2017[16]). The main supporting policies include direct subsidies (a feed-in premium system), taxation (including exemptions of biomass from various energy taxes), subsidised grid connection and balancing costs, and reinforcement of the grid to connect plants running on renewables. Denmark also has used several funding pools, including for renewables in district heating (geothermal energy and large heat pumps) in 2012-15, and in processing in 2013-20 (IEA, 2017[16]). The share of renewables in energy demand doubled over the past decade to reach 35% in 2017 (Chapter 1), putting Denmark on track to reach its goal of meeting half of energy demand with renewables by 2030. Current support policies were set up by the 2012 Energy Agreement and have since been adjusted several times. New post-2020 measures were agreed in the 2018 Energy Agreement.

TOWARDS GREEN GROWTH OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 that without new measures such as those in the 2018 Energy Agreement and climate and air proposal, growth in renewables would stagnate and fossil fuel consumption rise after 2020, due in part to planned energy-intensive data centres,11 so GHG emissions would begin increasing again from 2022 (EA, 2018[40]). If the 2018 Energy Agreement is fully implemented, GHG emissions will continue to decrease gradually after 2022 (Chapter 1). Denmark’s incentive structure had varying levels of success across renewable energy sources. Successful offshore wind tenders have resulted in record low prices, which, combined with technological advances, led to a 48% cost reduction in offshore wind between 2010 and 2016 (IEA, 2017[16]). The tenders have many successful characteristics, including guaranteed grid connection and electricity offtake and one primary entry point (one-stop shop) for permitting and licensing – both of which provide certainty to investors and drive costs down. Denmark has become a global leader in wind energy technology throughout the supply chain. Expansion of renewable and alternative fuels in the transport sector is increasing slowly. The support system for solar photovoltaic power has been revised several times over the last five years and the feed-in premium system was withdrawn for new projects in May 2016 because Energinet, the state-owned enterprise that runs the electricity and natural gas transmission systems, was receiving too many applications. The overall cost of supporting renewables has increased quite sharply since 2010 (Figure 3.5), reaching over DKK 8 billion (EUR 1.1 billion) in 2015. The government estimates that subsidies totalled about DKK 8.5 billion in 2018, the largest share being for offshore wind. The increase was driven by steadily growing generation eligible for support (notably offshore wind) and low electricity prices. Some 62% of gross electricity is produced with renewables support (the average across 26 EU countries is 16%), though the unit support levels (direct cost per MWh of supported electricity) are lower than in some EU peers. The cost of support per unit of renewables generation is highest for solar and biogas (IEA, 2017[16]). Most existing support measures have been financed by the PSO levy, which is added to the electricity price. It is being phased out over 2017-21, after which renewables development will be supported directly from the state budget. The PSO, determined quarterly, rose along with growing subsidy expenditure, reaching DKK 7.3 billion in 2015. It covered nearly all subsidy expenditure that year. Figure 3.5.

TOWARDS GREEN GROWTH  141 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 In 2017, the Energy Commission published recommendations on Danish energy policy after 2020. It estimated that the cost of reaching the target of 50% renewables by 2030 was manageable, provided Denmark could reduce the need for subsidies for renewables deployment and make development market-driven in the long term. The 2018 Energy Agreement aims to ensure a market-driven green transition. Among other things, it allocates DKK 4.2 billion (EUR 564 million) for technology-neutral procurement through tenders, and commits to harmonise and simplify subsidies as far as possible (Box 3.2). The agreement maintains sizeable subsidies to offshore wind and biogas. Both entail a risk of low value for money, but Denmark is willing to bear the high initial cost of being a front runner and exploring renewables options with environmental co-benefits (in the case of biogas).12 The agreement also announced “continued extensive extraction” of North Sea oil and gas to generate funds for the state budget and investment for the green transition. Box 3.2. Key components of the 2018 Energy Agreement In June 2018, the Danish government and Parliament reached agreement on a new energy policy to 2030. The Energy Agreement aims to help Denmark source 55% of gross final energy consumption from renewables by 2030 and to phase out coal from electricity production by the same year. Key measures include:  building three offshore wind farms with capacity of at least 2.4 GW  allocating DKK 4.2 billion (EUR 564 million) to a tender process by which different technologies compete on delivering renewable electricity at the lowest price  allocating DKK 4 billion (EUR 537 million) to expand green biogas production, including organic biogas  allocating DKK 500 million (EUR 67 million) to green transport over 2020-24 to enhance green mobility and transport  allocating DKK 500 million (EUR 67 million) annually to a market-based grant pool focused on energy savings (primarily in business) over 2021-24, of which DKK 200 million is earmarked for energy savings in buildings  allocating DKK 100 million (EUR 13 million) annually over 2021-24 to help finance energy renovations in buildings owned or operated by municipalities or regions  establishing a DKK 400 million (EUR 54 million) reserve in 2025 and allocating DKK 500 million (EUR 67 million) annually after 2026 to further enhance the use of renewables  relaxing electricity and electric heating taxes by about DKK 2 billion (EUR 268 million) in 2025  intensifying export promotion activities with DKK 174 million (EUR 23 million) over 2019-24  increasing funding to energy and climate research to DKK 1 billion (EUR 134 million) by 2024.

TOWARDS GREEN GROWTH OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Energy efficiency Denmark’s praiseworthy decoupling of GDP growth from energy consumption growth has been achieved through national energy efficiency objectives and various measures to meet them. A comprehensive energy savings strategy was published in 2014. The main measure on the supply side is the Energy Efficiency Obligation (EEO) for grid and distribution companies in the electricity, natural gas, district heating and oil sectors. Initiated about 20 years ago, it is a market-oriented system in which participants can choose the most cost-effective measures to achieve savings. The system is financed by end-users via energy bills.13 Annual saving targets set by the EEO have mostly been met. However, the additionality of the programme is rather low. There has also been concern about its rising cost to bill payers, in part linked to the lack of incentives for participants to reduce the cost of implementing the obligation (Fawcett, Rosenow and Bertoldi, 2018[42]; IEA, 2017[16]). The rising cost influenced recent reductions in EEO savings targets for 2015-20 (by about 15%). The 2018 Energy Agreement announced that the programme would expire in 2021, to be replaced by a market-based system, based on open tenders, in which bidders would offer energy savings at a given price. Savings are targeted in process energy in industrial and service businesses as well as the building sector. The new system is to be complemented by an information and data initiative to enhance knowledge about savings opportunities. The Danish Energy Agency has used voluntary energy efficiency agreements with large, energy-intensive businesses since 1996. Businesses that enter into a binding three-year agreement and commit to improve energy efficiency obtain a substantial reduction of the PSO (though that tax will be phased out by 2021). As the International Energy Agency has recommended, an option for continuing such agreements would be to increase the electricity tax (or other energy taxes) in industry from the current DKK 0.004/kWh except for companies committing to efficiency agreements (IEA, 2017[16]). Standards for new buildings have been strengthened considerably and are quite high. The rate of improvement of existing buildings is still quite low, despite numerous initiatives launched over the last several years, and is a major challenge for the future. One area that may require attention is energy labelling of buildings, which can have an impact on selling prices. The Energy Agreement commits to establishing a long-term building renovation strategy, including milestones for 2030, 2040 and 2050 (IEA, 2017[16]). 3.5.3. Investment in sustainable mobility Government expenditure on transport increased by more than 50% over 2005-16 in real terms, driven by a notable increase in rail infrastructure investment (Figure 3.6). This increase reflects commitments made in the 2012 Transport Agreement to improve public transport, which includes development of a new metro line in Copenhagen and light rail in Aarhus and Odense, as well as investment to electrify and improve signalling on the railway network. A former government agreed on a DKK 28.5 billion (EUR 3.8 billion) investment plan to build new railways, upgrade existing lines and electrify the network. The conversion was supposed to be financed by the Train Fund (Togfonden). The project was put on hold shortly thereafter, however, and later limited in scope. Investment and maintenance expenditure on roads decreased over 2005-16, but remains higher than rail investment in absolute terms (Figure 3.6). The 2018 climate and air proposal sets out goals and measures to reduce GHG emissions in the transport sector. These include stopping sales of new diesel and gasoline cars by I.3. TOWARDS GREEN GROWTH  143 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 2030 and of hybrid cars by 2035; convening municipalities to discuss how to achieve zero GHG and air pollutant emissions from buses by 2030, building on Copenhagen’s goal to use only electric buses by then; tightening taxi requirements so that no taxis emit GHGs or air pollutants by 2030; increasing scrapping premiums in an existing scrapping programme for old diesel vehicles;14 investing in climate-friendly asphalt; and increasing the required biofuel content of gasoline and diesel to 8%. The proposal also announced surveillance of sulphur emissions from ships in Danish waters. For the longer term, towards 2030 and 2035, the government established a commission of experts and government officials to propose measures on the transition of car transport. Figure 3.6. Investment in rail infrastructure increased StatLink 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888934002129 In March 2019, the government and the Danish People’s Party agreed on a long-term infrastructure investment plan. It includes DKK 112 billion for 2021-30, of which 54% is dedicated to road and 46% to rail. Measures such as upgrading core sections of main highways, building new highways and corridors, and upgrading connections to central highway corridors are expected to reduce congestion. Investment is also planned to upgrade speed and capacity on the rail corridor from Jutland and Funen to Zealand. As the infrastructure investment plan includes projects that were found to have negative net present value (e.g. Routes 9, 11 and 15), Denmark should prioritise projects with high socio-economic returns and re-evaluate projects with potentially negative returns. The Danish Productivity Commission noted in 2014 that unprofitable transport investments had led to a loss of DKK 21 billion for society over the previous decade (Productivity Commission, 2014[43]). Denmark had nearly 10 000 electric vehicles (EVs) on the road in 2017 (IEA, 2018[23]). This is rather low compared to European leaders such as Norway (about 170 000), the United Kingdom (140 000) and Germany (125 000), but Denmark’s overall car fleet is relatively small. To promote EVs, Denmark began offering rebates on registration, sales and circulation taxes as well as local incentives such as waivers on tolls, parking fees and ferries. The decision to phase in a registration tax for EVs due to concern over the level of government revenue resulted in a significant decline of new EV sales from 2015.

The Danish Road Directorate procured fast public EV charging points along the main highway corridors. EVs using such publicly accessible charging points get a 50% discount on the electricity tariff. Denmark is the only Nordic country that has used fiscal rebates on private charging infrastructure: homeowners who install an EV charging point can deduct the installation cost from their income tax. Until 2020, consumers who charge at home will receive a tax rebate of DKK 0.94/kWh (USD 0.14/kWh), cutting electricity costs almost in half. Denmark received the largest share of EU funding for charging infrastructure deployment in the Nordic region, participating in projects that totalled more than EUR 47 million and developed more than 150 public charging points (IEA, 2018[23]). It has a target of 3 000 publicly accessible charging stations by 2020, along with network coverage amounting to a charging point every 60 km. In this regard, the climate and air proposal announced investment of DKK 80 million (EUR 11 million) in new high-speed EV charging stations, along with regulatory changes (e.g. allowing municipalities to reduce parking charges for low-emission cars and let EVs drive in bus lanes). On the negative side, Denmark has some way to go to ensure interoperability of publicly accessible chargers. EV owners need different membership cards for access to outlets of the three main charging point operators. The government has discussed a policy framework to address this issue, but there have been no concrete implementation steps to date. 3.5.4. Investment in water and sanitation There are 87 municipally owned water utilities and 100 municipally owned wastewater companies, as well as more than 2 000 private waterworks. Investment in and operation of public water supply and wastewater treatment are entirely financed by user charges. All water users (households and industry) are metered, and both public water supply and wastewater treatment are charged according to metered consumption. Average water prices paid by households are the highest among OECD countries (Figure 3.7), although prices and price structure vary across the country.15 Price increases stimulated significant reductions in water consumption over the past decade, except in agriculture and industry (Chapter 1). There are no social tariffs (water pricing is purely volumetric), but since its inception in 2009, the Danish Water Utility Regulatory Authority has set annual price caps on each company subject to regulation (i.e. municipally owned water supply and wastewater treatment companies). The Water Sector Act of 2009 sets requirements with respect to a price ceiling and efficiency of water companies’ operating costs. The requirements are based on benchmarking16 by the regulatory authority aimed at identifying efficiency potential in the sector and in individual companies (DANVA, 2016[44]). Ultimately, the regulation aims to imitate competitive pressure. The Water Sector Act was amended in 2016 to require utilities to meet efficiency targets for total costs (i.e. operating and investment). This has created some policy uncertainty that may have contributed to a drop in investment in 2016 and could affect planned investment levels in the near term (DANVA, 2017[45]). Parliament recently agreed to strengthen the regulation in coming years by introducing revenue caps that can be adjusted to actual investment, instead of being fixed at a historic level. This will help improve companies’ ability to invest in new technology. I.3. TOWARDS GREEN GROWTH  145 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Figure 3.7. Water and wastewater tariffs are the highest in the OECD StatLink 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888934002148 On the basis of the price caps, the company sets tariffs for the following year. The tariffs must be approved by the municipality. Regulation has been effective in stopping price increases observed since 2004; tariffs have remained relatively stable since 2009, and investments, especially in wastewater utilities, have increased since that year while operating expenses have fallen for both drinking and wastewater utilities. In the long run, the rate of reduction in operating expenses is expected to decrease, and as a consequence there will be more focus on reducing investment costs. The price charged to users for drinking water (which is almost entirely from groundwater) covers the cost of groundwater protection, abstraction, treatment and delivery. The component charged for wastewater covers sewer operation, maintenance, renovation and expansion, as well as operation and inspection of wastewater treatment plants (DANVA, 2017[45]). The political decision in 2013 to gradually reduce the wastewater charges for large water users – up to DKK 700 million per year from 2018 has resulted in considerable discounts for large users such as slaughterhouses, refineries and breweries. The change from a flat charge to a regressive system (i.e. lower rates as consumption increases) aimed to reduce the share of total wastewater company costs that large consumers paid, which was considered disproportionate. The water companies compensate for this discount by either increasing efficiency or raising wastewater tariffs for other users (DANVA, 2017[45]). Properties discharging particularly polluted wastewater pay an additional fee on top of the annual fee for ordinary wastewater.17 3.6. Promoting eco-innovation and green markets 3.6.1. Eco-innovation Denmark is an innovation leader: its innovation system ranked second only to Sweden among EU countries in 2017 (EC, 2018[46]). The business, entrepreneurship and innovation environment is one of the most favourable in the OECD, reflecting a flexible and well-functioning labour market, low regulatory barriers and high public spending on R&D. a) Average tariff based on consumption of 15m3 per month.

TOWARDS GREEN GROWTH OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 In 2016, gross domestic R&D expenditure amounted to 2.9% of GDP, above the OECD average of 2.3%. Business R&D expenditure accounts for 1.9% of GDP, compared to 1.6% for the OECD. The high level of overall spending masks a strong concentration in a few large firms, dominated by pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. Only 25% of business R&D is attributable to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) (OECD, 2019[1]). Denmark has developed a high level of specialisation in environment-related technology (Figure 3.8). In 2015, 17% of high-value inventions were environment-related, down from nearly 25% in 2010 but still one of the highest shares among OECD countries. Per capita, Denmark ranks second among OECD countries, following Korea. Most patents are filed in the fields of wind energy and energy-related climate change mitigation technology. Figure 3.8. Denmark is a leader in green innovation StatLink 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888934002167 Government budget allocations for environmental R&D reached 1.1% of the total government R&D budget in 2018; energy-related R&D reached 3% and agricultural R&D 2.7% (OECD, 2018[47]). While the energy-related R&D budget was halved over 2013-16 (Figure 3.9), Denmark committed to increase investment in clean energy innovation by doubling funding to the Danish Energy Technology Development and Demonstration Programme (EUDP) from DKK 292 million (EUR 39 million) in 2015/16 to DKK 580 million (EUR 78 million) in 2020 as part of Mission Innovation.18 This will bring up total budget expenditure, although not to pre-2015 levels. The 2018 Energy Agreement announced gradually rising state funding for energy and climate-related research, development and demonstration (RD&D) to DKK 1 billion (EUR 134 million) in 2024. One of the most important RD&D programmes is the Danish Eco-Innovation Programme under MEF, which has supported development, testing and demonstration of environmentally efficient technology since 2007.

An evaluation found that the fund led to significant business activity among participating companies: for every DKK 1 million in grants, participating companies had average annual turnover of DKK 2.9 million related to that technology, in addition to experiencing a stronger employment development than the Danish business sector in general (DAMVAD Analytics, 2017[48]). Most supported projects focused on reducing nitrogen load in water bodies and reducing CO2 emissions. In addition, the Green Development and Demonstration Programme supports demonstration projects with positive environmental effects in the food industry. Its budget in 2018 was around DKK 206 million (EUR 27.6 million). The greatest commitment to green technology and innovation has been in the energy area. Several RD&D programmes aim to increase employment, sales and exports, and reduce CO2 emissions, in the energy sector. An evaluation of the three main programmes found that they were successful in meeting these objectives, in part due to their risk alleviation mechanism (COWI et al., 2015[49]). The largest programme is the EUDP, which provides grants for clean energy technology with commercial potential that could be exported to growing markets (EUDP, 2017[50]). Its 2018 budget was about DKK 400 million, down from more than DKK 1 billion in 2011. The 2018 Energy Agreement committed to increase funding for energy and climate-related RD&D to DKK 1 million by 2024. The climate and air proposal allocates additional resources to climate-related R&D, including DKK 90 million (EUR 12 million) to develop low-GHG farming practices that have synergies with other environmental policies, and DKK 100 million (EUR 13 million) for carbon capture and storage in farmland and forests. Subsidies are provided to support conversion of peatland under agricultural development to permanent nature areas (Section 3.4.2). While agricultural R&D is high compared to agricultural value added, the additional resources for climate technology are welcome in light of the limited cost-effective solutions and lack of regulation for emission reductions for this sector to date, putting Denmark on track to establishing itself as a leader in providing climate-friendly agricultural products. 148  I.3.

Environmental goods and services market Environmental goods and services (EGS) contribute significantly to the Danish economy. Production in the EGS sector totalled DKK 214 billion (EUR 29 billion) in 2016, an increase of 23% in nominal terms from 2014 (Statistics Denmark, 2018[51]). The rise is linked extensively to the production and export of renewables technology, especially wind turbines. Despite stiff competition, the wind sector continues to perform well and drove turnover growth over 2012-16. Overall, 52% of EGS-related production in 2016 was related to renewables, followed by energy efficiency (Figure 3.10). The EGS sector employed 71 000 people, or 3% of the workforce (SD, 2018[6]), and accounted for nearly 15% of exports in 2015, the highest share among OECD countries (OECD, 2017[52]). Green technology continues to be a focal area for environment, climate and agriculture, and substantial subsidies for it are provided. The number of Danish companies adopting the ISO 14001 environmental management system has fluctuated between 800 and 1 000 in recent years. It increased gradually from 2013, potentially encouraged by public support promoting uptake (Chapter 2). Many companies in Denmark use the European Eco Management and Audit Scheme, which sets stricter environmental targets and company performance standards than ISO 14001. In the agricultural sector, producers have been more resistant to environmental standards but use food-related eco-labelling (Varga, 2016[53]). Demark has a well-functioning public procurement system that includes green, social, SME and innovation criteria. Green procurement criteria have been introduced for electricity-using products and the timber and transport product groups. National initiatives supporting uptake of green public procurement include knowledge-sharing networks, partnerships for front runners, best practice examples and a green public procurement task force to assist public authorities in implementing green public procurement (see also Chapter 4, Box 4.7). The Danish Environmental Protection Agency has published an e-learning tool to provide stakeholders with basic knowledge on green public procurement. 0 200 400 600 800 1 000 1 200 1 400 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 DKK milliona Public energy-related RD&D budgets, 2005-17 Energy efficiency Fossil fuels Renewable energy supply Nuclear Hydrogen and fuel cellls Other 0 5 000 10 000 15 000 20 000 25 000 0 200 400 600 800 1 000 1 200 1 400 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 DKK milliona DKK milliona Government R&D budgets for energy, agriculture and the environment, 2005-18 Environment Energy Agriculture Total (right axis) a) At 2017 prices.\nSource: IEA (2018), Energy Technology RD&D Budgets (database); OECD (2019), “Research and Development Statistics: Government budget appropriations or outlays for RD”, OECD Science, Technology and R&D Statistics (database).\nI.3.

Renewable energy production accounts for nearly half of EGS turnover StatLink 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888934002205 3.7. Environment, trade and development 3.7.1. Trade and export credits Denmark’s open economy is highly dependent on foreign trade. Exports (in value added terms) contribute around 31% of GDP, below the OECD median but comparable with Sweden and Finland (OECD, 2017[54]). The transition towards a low-carbon, circular economy is seen as an economic opportunity through export of Danish environmental technology and services, notably in the energy technology field. Clean tech has been the fastest-growing Danish export sector in recent years. A major driver behind strong export performance is Denmark’s international reputation as a front runner in green solutions, a strong framework of export financing, and assistance for internationalisation of innovation and commercial activities. The export strategy for energy technology, presented in March 2017, envisages doubling exports of energy technology from around DKK 70 billion in 2015 to at least DKK 140 billion by 2030. The strategy sets a strategic framework for export initiatives in the energy sector and introduces new efforts, including a programme aimed at the United States, United Kingdom and Germany. It also contains instruments to advance green energy through the Danish International Development Agency (Danida) in high-growth and developing countries (Section 3.7.2). Denmark backs the 2012 OECD Recommendation on Common Approaches for Officially Supported Export Credits and Environmental and Social Due Diligence. Its Export Credit Agency, EKF, maintains an active corporate social responsibility policy that complies with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises as well as the UN Principles on Business and Human Rights and The Common Approaches. Denmark is also a signatory to the UN Global Compact and the Equator Principles. Accordingly, EKF incorporates evaluation of environmental and human rights risk in its risk assessment (OECD, 2016[55]). It discloses information on Category A projects (those with potential significant adverse environmental and/or social impact under OECD Common Approaches) at least 30 days before it is decided if EKF can take part.

Between 2003 and 2013, Denmark provided more export credits for renewable power generation projects than any other OECD country, thanks to extensive support to wind energy. No support was granted to coal-fired power plants over the period, and the share targeting power generation projects based on oil, diesel or natural gas was relatively small (OECD, 2015[57]). EKF is a global leader in wind project funding, having financed more than 100 wind farms globally, worth more than DKK 100 billion, over the past 20 years. In 2017, wind projects made up 48% of EKF’s total portfolio. 3.7.2. Development co-operation Development co-operation and humanitarian action are guided by the World 2030 strategy, which is based on the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs. Inclusive, sustainable growth and development form one of the strategic aims, with a focus on energy, water, agriculture, food and other areas where Denmark has special knowledge, resources and interests (Danida, 2017[58]). The government aims to increasingly use official development assistance (ODA) to boost the contribution of the private sector to sustainable development in developing countries while promoting Danish technology transfer (MOF, 2017[2]). To this end, it aims to strengthen the Investment Fund for Developing Countries (IFU), Denmark’s central development finance institution. The IFU manages two major blended finance19 instruments: the Danish Climate Investment Fund and the Danish Agribusiness Fund (Box 3.3). While the focus on mobilising private sources for sustainable development is line with global efforts to scale up blended finance, it is important to ensure that these activities do not come at the expense of untied ODA. I.3. TOWARDS GREEN GROWTH  151 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Box 3.3. Using public-private partnerships in development co-operation The Danish Climate Investment Fund was established in 2012 to promote climate-related investment in developing countries and emerging markets, combining commercial and environmental objectives with the goal of reducing global warming and contributing to climate change adaptation in developing countries while promoting transfer of Danish climate technology. The fund started in 2014 with capital of DKK 1.3 billion (EUR 174 million), of which 40% was public funding and 60% private (from Danish pension and capital funds). The fund is now fully invested. One of its biggest projects includes development of a 300 MW wind park in Kenya, the largest wind farm in Africa. The IFU expected annual return of 12%. The Danish Agribusiness Fund, based on a similar model, was established in 2016 to provide risk capital for agriculture and food investment in developing and emerging countries and to promote sales of Danish technology and know-how. Of its total capital of DKK 800 million (EUR 107 million), 37% comes from public resources (the state and IFU) and 63% from Danish pension funds. In June 2018, the prime minister launched the SDG Fund to enhance investment in key SDG areas by mobilising public and private capital, technology and know-how, and promoting responsible business conduct. It was established by six Danish pension funds and the IFU, which also acts as fund manager. By June 2018, capital commitments to the fund had reached DKK 4.1 billion (EUR 550 million), of which 60% was from private resources (each pension fund committed DKK 400 million) and 40% from public resources. It is expected that the fund will contribute to investment of at least DKK 30 billion. Investment will mainly be in sectors where Denmark has strong expertise and experience, such as renewables and energy efficiency, agribusiness and food, water and sanitation, and industry and services.

In 2017, Denmark provided USD 2.4 billion in net ODA, which represented 0.72% of gross national income (GNI) (OECD, 2018[60]). This makes Denmark one of five OECD Development Assistance Committee members to have met the UN target of allocating 0.7% of GNI as ODA. Net ODA disbursements have declined in recent years in real terms, reflecting the government’s pre-election promise to bring the ODA/GNI ratio back to 0.7% from nearly 0.9% in 2014. This affected budget for support to sustainable natural resource management, the energy sector and climate change activities (OECD, 2016[61]). Taken together, environment- and climate change-related ODA dropped by 44% between 2014 and 2017 (Figure 3.11), creating a gap between strategic priorities and financial allocations. In 2017, 26% of Danish bilateral allocable development finance supported the environment, compares with the DAC country average of 33% in 2016 (OECD, 2018[62]). The overall decrease in ODA has, however, been accompanied by increased efforts to engage the private sector and mobilise private investment (Box 3.3). 152  I.3.

TOWARDS GREEN GROWTH  153 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Recommendations on moving towards green growth Framework for sustainable development  Continue developing green national accounts, publish them regularly and monitor their use in decision making; strengthen the statistical underpinning of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development at the national level and ensure that indicators are as internationally comparable as possible. Greening the tax system  Reduce the energy taxation gap between households and businesses to equalise incentives for energy savings and CO2 reduction; continue efforts to make electric solutions for heating and mobility more attractive vis-à-vis fossil-fuel-based options.  Improve alignment of transport taxes with transport-generated externalities; in particular, ensure that lower taxes on vehicle ownership are matched by an increase in taxation of vehicle use (e.g. in congested areas). Investment in a greener economy  Continue to gradually phase out subsidies to renewables technology as it becomes economically competitive, and ensure that remaining support is technology-neutral.  Regularly evaluate the effectiveness of and necessity for biogas subsidies; foster synergies between biogas development policies and nutrient management policies.  Establish mechanisms to mobilise private investment in carbon capture and storage options, including those arising from peatland rewetting. Eco-innovation and green markets  Continue support for and ensure continuity of R&D in energy and other environmentally relevant areas, including climate mitigation options in agriculture and land use. Strengthen opportunities and incentives for more SMEs to engage in R&D. Development co-operation  Continue to use ODA to leverage private investment in projects supporting sustainable development, ensuring that it does not come at the expense of untied ODA. Notes 1 The tax on fossil waste applies only to heat produced from non-renewable industrial waste. Consumption of such waste is small. 154  I.3. TOWARDS GREEN GROWTH OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 2 As the EU ETS covers electricity generation, a reduction in electricity use in Denmark has shifted CO2 emissions to elsewhere in the EU. With the 2017 modifications of the EU ETS, lower electricity use in Denmark has some impact on EU-wide CO2 emissions, but it is expected to be modest. 3 The annual tax is levied on private cars registered since 1 July 1997 (cars registered before that date are subject to a weight-based tax) as well as on commercial vehicles registered since 18 March 2009. 4 The registration tax provides discounts or extra charges depending on the car’s fuel consumption. Requirements became more stringent in 2017. The current legislation allows a discount of DKK 4 000 for each kilometre a petrol-fuelled car travels in excess of 20 km per litre (22 for diesel cars), while the extra charge is DKK 6 000 per km/l a petrol car travels short of these values. As for the green owner tax, semi-annual rates vary from DKK 330 for petrol cars driving at least 50km/l to DKK 11 430 for cars driving less than 4.5 km/l (rates for diesel cars vary between DKK 130 to DKK 16 720). 5 The Eurovignette is used in the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Denmark and Sweden. It was also used in Belgium and Germany before these two countries switched to distance-based pricing in 2016 and 2003, respectively. 6 Preliminary estimate. 7 The Ministry of Taxation has decided not to regard this measure as tax expenditure and thus stopped calculating revenue forgone. In CHP there is no physics law to determine the split between fuel used for heat and fuel used for power. The reduced energy duty for CHP generation is a way to determine the tax base for fuels used for heat production in CHP. The Ministry of Taxation does not consider this a subsidy for fossil fuels. 8 The EU ecological focus areas cover a broad range of features, including ones that affect biodiversity directly (e.g. fallow land and buffer strips) or indirectly (e.g. reduced input use, better soil protection through catch crops or nitrogen-fixing crops). 9 The transfer represented 5% of EU direct payments in 2015, 6% in 2016 and 7% from 2017 onwards, adding around DKK 460 million to the RDP programme in 2019. 10 The statistics include only activities that directly serve an environmental protection purpose (such as waste or wastewater management) and exclude activities that produce specially designed products used to serve an environmental purpose (such as facilities for renewables). 11 The authorities estimate that installation of six planned data centres will drive up Danish electricity consumption by between 13% and 15%. 12 Digested manure provides high-quality natural fertiliser that emits less nitrous oxide than untreated manure. 13 Oil companies include the cost of energy efficiency measures in their prices. 14 The premium for scrapping diesel vehicles from before 2006 will be increased to DKK 5 000 (EUR 670); an additional DKK 100 million has been allocated for this purpose. The subsidy will be disbursed on a first-come, first-served basis. 15 For example, some companies charge a fixed annual basic contribution for water and wastewater plus a variable price per cubic metre consumed, while others calculate and bill for water only according to the consumed amount. 16 The efficiency requirement is based on a theoretical calculated net volume target. This enables comparison of multiple water companies, irrespective of size, type, framework conditions, number of customers, etc. The net volume target thus expresses how much in operating costs a company can be expected to have to match the average level of efficiency.

Waste, materials management and the circular economy Denmark has long been an OECD leader in using incineration with energy recovery to reduce the amount of waste landfilled. Nevertheless, increasing household waste recycling and implementing meaningful waste prevention measures to address very high levels of waste generation are still major challenges. A new national strategy for circular economy, adopted in September 2018, and the subsequent political agreement aim to provide new impetus for alternative business models that put resource efficiency, waste prevention and recycling at the heart of production and consumption. This chapter gives an overview of trends in material use and waste generation, and of related policies. It reviews the effectiveness of instruments used to encourage waste prevention, reduction and recycling, and identifies implementation gaps and opportunities in moving towards a circular economy.

WASTE, MATERIALS MANAGEMENT AND THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 4.1. Introduction Denmark has long been a front runner in the OECD on reducing the amount of waste landfilled and viewing waste as an important resource. It has a comprehensive policy mix of regulatory measures (ban on landfilling waste that can be incinerated, compulsory audit of buildings to be demolished to facilitate removal of polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs]), economic instruments (taxes on landfilling, waste incineration and packaging, product charges, raw material extraction tax, extended producer responsibility and deposit-refund programmes for beverage containers), market and innovation support measures (funding for innovation and green public procurement) and information programmes (eco-label promotion). It has made impressive achievements in terms of recovery and recycling for most waste streams. In particular, construction and demolition (C&D) waste management is among best OECD practices. Household waste recycling, however, remains a notable exception. Heavy public investment in incineration for municipal waste treatment has created a path dependency featuring high levels of municipal waste generation and limited domestic recycling infrastructure. Municipalities, the main owners of waste incineration plants, face excess waste incineration capacity. Current policies and strategies are trying to address these shortcomings, with mixed results. The 2016 Utilities for the Future strategy proposes an in-depth reorganisation of the waste management sector, increasing competition among incineration operators and the role of the private sector in collection and recycling. However, discussions over practical implementation have stalled, and uncertainty over the future waste management framework is deterring investment in a circular economy. In this context, the national circular economy strategy, adopted in September 2018, and subsequent political agreement provide a welcome new impetus for alternative business models that put resource efficiency and recycling at the heart of production and consumption. This chapter gives an overview of trends in material use and in waste generation and treatment. It presents the Danish policy objectives and institutional settings for waste, materials management and transition to a circular economy. It also reviews the effectiveness of policy instruments used to encourage waste prevention, reduction and recycling as well as to manage the transition towards a circular economy. 4.2. Trends in waste management and material consumption 4.2.1. Trends in material consumption The Danish economy uses a significant amount of resources. In 2017, domestic material consumption (DMC) per capita was around 24 tonnes, far above the averages for OECD Europe (13 tonnes per capita) and the OECD (15 tonnes per capita). While DMC was decoupled from economic growth in 2008, at the time of the global economic crisis, it has been rising again since 2014 (Figure 4.1). About half of DMC consists of non-metallic minerals, particularly stone, gravel and sand extracted from the environment for construction activities. Such activities thus heavily influence recent trends in material consumption. Since the economic slowdown ended, the construction sector has been recovering, boosted by large infrastructure projects such as the Copenhagen metro and Fehmarnbelt tunnel. Planned transport infrastructure investment is estimated at DKK 100 billion (EUR 13.5 billion). Over 2010-16, production grew by 17.2% in the construction sector and 36.6% in civil engineering (European Commission, 2018[1]). II.4. WASTE, MATERIALS MANAGEMENT AND THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY  165 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Figure 4.1. Material consumption was decoupled from economic growth but is trending up StatLink 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888934002243 Denmark extracted around 110 million tonnes of raw materials in 2016 (58% of direct material input) and imported 65 million tonnes (37% of direct material input) of the resources needed for its economy. The main import category, representing half of total imports, is fossil fuels, even though Denmark extracted 11 million tonnes of oil and gas. It was a net exporter of crude oil for almost all the review period, but became a net importer in 2016 (SD, 2017[2]). Waste is also a noteworthy material flow, at 2.3 million tonnes exported and 1 million tonnes imported. Resource productivity (economic value generated per unit of material used) increased from USD 1.57 to USD 1.99 per kg of material consumption between 2005 and 2017. This suggests that the economy generally used resources more efficiently towards the end of the review period. However, resource productivity remained below the averages for the OECD (at USD 2.49 per kg) and OECD Europe (USD 2.75 per kg) in 2017 (Figure 4.2). This reflects mainly the pre-eminence of the construction sector and high share of non-metallic minerals in DMC. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that resource productivity will improve by 16% by 2030 (MEF, 2016[3]) but notes that past and future development in resource use and productivity heavily depends on the construction sector. Construction is unlikely to slow in coming years. Denmark has the third oldest building stock in Europe and energy policies may lead to increased refurbishment. Furthermore, climate change policies may require construction of coastal protection systems. Sand and gravel are abundant and cheap, and 87% of C&D waste is recovered, representing a limited alternative to the raw material. Phasing out fossil fuels to meet the objective of reducing dependence on fossil energy carriers by 2050 will have limited impact on resource use. A reduction of fossil fuels in DMC from 24 million tonnes in 2014 to around 19.7 million tonnes in 2030 is expected. 0 50 100 150 200 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 Domestic material consumption, 2005-17a Biomass Fossil energy materials/ carriers Non-metallic minerals Metals Million tonnes 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 Trends in GDP, material consumption and municipal waste generation, 2005-17 GDP (real) Domestic material consumptionª Municipal solid wasteᵇ 2005=100 a) Refers to domestic material consumption, i.e. domestic material extraction plus imports minus exports of materials and derived products.\nb) Break in time series in 2011.\nSource: OECD (2019), “Material resources” and “Municipal waste generation and treatment”, OECD Environment Statistics (database); OECD (2018), OECD National Accounts Statistics (database); Statistics Denmark (2019), “Economy-wide material flow accounts”, StatBank (database).\n166  II.4.

Trends in waste generation and management Total waste Total waste generation increased substantially during the review period. Between 2010 and 2016, it rose by 30%, from about 15 million tonnes to 20 million tonnes. The increase was linked to C&D waste generation, which accounted for nearly 61% of total waste generated in 2016 (Figure 4.3). While waste generation increased overall, it decreased in several economic sectors, including utilities, mining and quarrying, and manufacturing. Figure 4.3.

II.4. WASTE, MATERIALS MANAGEMENT AND THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY  167 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Municipal waste Denmark has reported the highest amount of municipal waste per capita in the OECD since 2007, reaching 785 kg per inhabitant in 2017, far above the OECD average of 524 kg (Figure 4.4). This may be due in part to national methodological specificities; for example, Denmark reported 127 kg of garden waste per capita under municipal waste in 2017. Even without garden waste, however, Denmark would rank among the six largest OECD municipal waste generators in 2017, at 658 kg per capita. Figure 4.4. Danish per capita municipal waste generation is the highest in the OECD StatLink 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888934002300 Overall, municipal waste generation has increased by 13% since 2005, though it remained stable at around 4.4 million tonnes per year after the introduction of a new waste information system in 2010. During the review period, in 2005-10 and 2011-15, municipal waste generation rose faster than private final consumption. A decoupling between municipal waste generation and private final consumption can be observed in 2016-17, the latest years for which data are available. In terms of waste treatment, Denmark has been an OECD front-runner in diverting municipal waste from landfill, mainly through incineration with energy recovery. Landfilling decreased from 5% to 1% of municipal waste treated between 2005 and 2017. Incineration with energy recovery accounted for 53% of municipal waste treated in 2017. The rest was composted (19%) or recycled (27%) (Figure 4.5).

Since 2011 and the launch of the new waste information system, the level of hazardous waste generation has varied: 422 000 tonnes in 2013, 584 000 tonnes in 2015, and back down to 550 000 tonnes in 2016. The fluctuation mainly reflects an increased focus on collecting and treating waste contaminated with PCBs, in particular when demolishing old buildings containing PCBs. In 2016, 42% of hazardous waste was recycled, 23% incinerated and 17% underwent special treatment, with only 18% destined for disposal. Specific waste streams For several waste streams, Denmark experienced significant variations in waste generation during the review period, mainly following economic trends. Waste generation is now back on the rise. For all waste streams, Denmark has made remarkable achievements in terms of recycling and recovery. Regarding C&D waste, generation declined during the economic crisis and has been rising again since 2011, with 4.3 million tonnes generated in 2016. Denmark achieves high recovery levels for such waste: around 95% over 2007-09 and slightly lower in later years (down to 87% in 2016), probably due to methodological changes as well as improved removal of PCB-contaminated waste. Packaging waste generation also decreased substantially during the financial crisis, from around 900 000 tonnes in 2008 to 690 000 tonnes in 2009 and 2010, but has since been rising, with 880 000 tonnes generated in 2016. Reported recovery and recycling rates in this stream are also remarkable: in 2015, Denmark recovered 94% of packaging waste and recycled 74%. During the review period, collection of end-of-life vehicles (ELVs) was stable at around 100 000 tonnes, increasing substantially in 2012 (114 000 tonnes) and 2013 (129 000 tonnes). Due to the financial crisis, car owners may have postponed replacing old Note: 2010 data are not available, break in time series in 2011; recycling rates maybe underestimated due to lack of reporting.\nSource: OECD (2019), “Municipal waste generation and treatment”, OECD Environment Statistics (database).\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Municipal waste treatment, 2005-17 % Recycling % Composting % Incineration with energy recovery % Landfill II.4.

In 2016, recovery and reuse was estimated at 95% while recycling and reuse reached 89%. The amount of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) peaked in 2007 at 98 000 tonnes. It amounted to around 72 000 tonnes in 2015. Recycling and recovery levels that year were high at 84.2% and 92%, respectively. Industrial waste steadily declined over the period, from 1.8 million tonnes in 2005 to 1.1 million tonnes in 2016. In terms of treatment, 73% of industrial waste is recycled, 18% incinerated and 9% destined for disposal. Waste shipment Regarding transboundary movement of waste, Denmark mainly trades waste for recovery with neighbouring European countries and Turkey. Waste destined for recovery represented 93% of imports and 97% of exports in 2015. Iron, paper and cardboard are among the main export categories, reflecting the limited domestic recycling capacity for these waste streams. Denmark has no steelworks using scrap, and a few and relatively small paper and cardboard mills. The main destination countries for exports are Germany, Turkey, Norway and Sweden. Waste exported to Turkey consists mainly of waste metal. Imports of waste have risen significantly since 2011, mainly due to increasing import of waste suitable for incineration, but have stabilised since 2014, reflecting excess incineration capacity (Figure 4.6). Figure 4.6. Imports of waste rose significantly from 2011 but stabilised in 2014, while exports are trending down StatLink 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888934002338 Waste management expenditure Overall, the cost of waste management services increased substantially during the review period.

Waste management expenditure by industry StatLink 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888934002395 4.3. Objectives, policies and institutions for waste, materials management and circular economy 4.3.1. Policy framework and objectives During the review period (2005-18), Denmark defined its main policies and objectives related to waste management in a series of plans and strategies. The third national Danish Waste Plan, launched in 2003 for 2005-08, aimed not only at reducing the environmental impact of waste but also increasing effectiveness in the waste sector. In terms of waste prevention, the objective was not to decrease overall waste generation but rather to decouple its increase from economic growth. The plan included targets to increase recycling to 65% and incineration with energy recovery to 26% while reducing landfilling to 9%. It also included EU requirements and targets for certain waste streams (packaging, WEEE, ELV) (Copenhagen Resource Institute, 2013[4]). The fourth national Danish Waste Plan (2009-12) was developed in two parts: a strategic part linking waste management with the objectives of climate, resource and environmental protection policy, followed in 2010 by a second part focusing on prevention, particularly as regards food waste. The main targets from the previous plan were unchanged except the one on landfilling, which was lowered to 6% by 2012. The current strategy on waste management and resources, launched in 2013 as Denmark without Waste: Recycle More, Incinerate Less (Government of Denmark, 2013[5]), represents a paradigm change for a country that relies heavily on incineration with energy Food products, beverages, tobacco 18% Wood, paper, printing 5% Furniture, other manufacturing 3% Chemicals 15% Pharmaceuticals 9% Products of glass, clay, etc.\n7% Basic/fabricated metal products 10% Machinery, equipment, repair 13% Energy and water supply 8% Other 12% Waste management expenditure from the industry sector, 2016 Note: Data refer to expenditure for waste management from the manufacturing industry.\nSource: Statistics Denmark (2018), “Environmental and economic accounts”, StatBank (database).\n172  II.4.

The strategic goals are reflected in the latest national waste management plan, Denmark without waste: Resource Plan for Waste Management 2013-2018, launched in 2014. The strategy and plan establish one main quantitative target: to collect 50% of seven household waste fractions (biowaste, paper, cardboard, glass, wood, plastic and metal) for recycling by 2022 (by contrast, 75% of household waste was incinerated in 2011). This target reflects the EU Waste Framework Directive target of separately collecting 50% of the dry fractions of municipal waste (paper, cardboard, plastic and metal), although the EU targets have a different basis for assessment. In addition, the strategy includes indicative targets to measure its effects on specific sectors (Table 4.1). For instance, recycling of organic waste from the service sector (restaurants, food shops) is expected to reach 60% by 2022. Apart from the household waste target, most legally binding targets for waste management derive from EU targets. Table 4.1.

WASTE, MATERIALS MANAGEMENT AND THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY  173 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 A waste prevention strategy, Denmark without Waste II (Government of Denmark, 2015[6]), was launched in 2015 for 2015-27. It identifies two crosscutting topics (supporting resource efficiency among businesses and green consumption) and five action areas (food waste, construction, textile, electrical and electronic equipment, and packaging). The strategy has seven qualitative targets combined with nine quantitative indicators to monitor progress on all topics and action areas, such as the number of businesses with a certified environmental management system, the number of eco-labelled products, and waste generation in specific industry sectors and in households. A six-year revision of the strategy is envisaged. A circular economy strategy (MEF and MIBFA, 2018[7]) was adopted in September 2018 (Box 4.1). It does not include additional policy targets, but instead recognises the role of private companies as a driving force for the transition to a circular economy, envisaging voluntary commitment by the private sector to increase resource productivity by 40% between 2014 and 2030 and increase recycling to 80% of total waste (excluding mineral waste) generated. Box 4.1. The advisory board on circular economy and the circular economy strategy Denmark has long been involved in preparation of its circular economy strategy. In the autumn of 2016, the government established the advisory board on circular economy composed of 12 business leaders representing companies of all sizes and from a range of sectors. The board was chaired by the chairman of Carlsberg, and benefitted from a joint secretariat formed by MEF and MIBFA. The EPA and the Danish Business Authority were also part of the secretariat. The board published its main report with 27 recommendations in June 2017 (MEF, 2017[8]). It recommended that Denmark should adopt the following objectives:  deriving more value from materials to increase resource productivity by 40% (based on amounts) and 15% (based on value)  increasing circularity to 80% recycling of total waste (excluding mineral waste) and reducing total waste (excluding mineral waste) by 15%  retaining the lead in development of circular technology and solutions  using excess capacity better by getting 50% of the population active in the sharing economy  boosting circular economy by quadrupling turnover of eco-labelled products and services. Denmark launched the circular economy strategy in September 2018. It identifies 15 initiatives in six main chapters:  strengthening companies as the driving force for the circular transition  supporting circular economy through data and digitalisation  promoting circular design  changing consumption patterns through circular economics  creating a well-functioning market for waste and secondary raw materials 174  II.4. WASTE, MATERIALS MANAGEMENT AND THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019  deriving more value from buildings and biomass. The recommendations from the advisory board and the strategy are supported by key business organisations, including the Confederation of Industries, the Chamber of Commerce, the Construction Association and the Agriculture and Food Council. The strategy also refers to the new mandatory EU targets and requirements. In May 2018, the EU adopted a circular economy package introducing ambitious binding targets for recycling of municipal waste (55% in 2025, 60% in 2030 and 65% in 2035) and packaging waste (65% in 2025 and 70% in 2030). Other new requirements relevant for Denmark include separate collection of biowaste by 2023 and establishment of extended producer responsibility for packaging by 2025. Other national strategies are of relevance for Denmark’s waste, materials management and transition to a circular economy. The national strategy on the sharing economy (Government of Denmark, 2017[9]) aims to maximise use of assets such as cars and buildings, ultimately leading to less consumption. A utilities strategy, Supply for the Future, which is under discussion, is expected to significantly modify the organisation of waste management services. It proposes increased competition in the incineration sector by letting business freely choose where to send combustible waste and making it compulsory for municipalities to organise public tenders for household waste treatment for recycling and incineration. It also suggests directing all recyclable waste treatment to the private sector; the role is currently divided between municipalities and the private sector. 4.3.2. Legal framework Denmark has an extensive legal framework to address the environmentally sound waste management. It consists of a general framework law complemented by regulations for specific waste streams, treatment methods and specific policy aspects of waste management (data system, deposit programmes). The Environmental Protection Act (Consolidation Act No. 966 of 23 June 2017) provides the general framework law and establishes the main objectives of environmental protection, including for waste. It is accompanied by a framework regulation, the Statutory Order on Waste (Affaldsbekendtgørelsen), the main legal instrument governing waste management. Regulations cover various waste streams (batteries, ELVs, tyres, WEEE, residual waste, bio-ash, soil moving), waste treatment types (incineration, landfill) and aspects of waste management policies (data, register, impact assessment, environmental supervision, deposit systems). Regarding taxation, a 2011 law establishes taxes on waste and raw materials while a regulation establishes a packaging tax. 4.3.3. Institutional framework and governance At the national level, responsibility for waste management policy is shared by the Ministry of Environment and Food (MEF) for overall policy objectives (environmental aspects, recycling promotion, etc.) and the Ministry of Climate, Energy and Utilities (MCEU) for economic regulation of the sector and delivery of waste management services. The transition to a circular economy is the primary responsibility of MEF, which co-ordinates inter-ministerial processes involving other ministries (Ministry of Industry, Business and Financial Affairs (MIBFA), MCEU, Ministry of Transport and Building, and Ministry of Higher Education and Science). This includes co-ordination of the circular II.4. WASTE, MATERIALS MANAGEMENT AND THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY  175 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 economy strategy. MEF also co-ordinated an inter-ministerial task force on increased resource efficiency, which carried out studies to identify barriers to business uptake of resource efficiency policies. Activities are being conducted to create communication tools and guidance on the definition of waste and end-of-waste criteria, waste import and export rules, and interpretation of VAT regulations for used products. Denmark has a strong tradition of stakeholder platforms and reflection groups, with many councils, advisory boards and partnerships involving public authorities. The Bioeconomy Council gathers businesses, industry associations and universities to promote development of value chains and is working on bio-based products, focusing on plastics, textiles and construction. The advisory board on circular economy (Box 4.1) prepared recommendations on elaboration of the circular economy strategy. Partnerships involving industry and business as well as public authorities deal with a wide range of practical issues related to implementation of national strategies on green public procurement, WEEE collection, sustainable construction and waste prevention, reduction of food waste, etc. At the local level, the 98 municipalities are the main entities responsible for waste management. The five regional councils were in charge of orphan contaminated sites, but in March 2019 the government decided that this and other regional responsibilities would be transferred to the national level. Municipalities benefit from a large degree of autonomy in waste management planning and develop 12-year waste management plans at least every 6 years, in addition to infrastructure development, permitting and monitoring of waste management facilities (except the largest ones, which are controlled at the national level). Inter-municipal co-operation is also common. In many cases, municipalities own or co-own waste treatment facilities. Eighty-two municipalities are owners or co-owners of waste incineration plants. Municipal responsibilities are evolving. Since January 2010, they are no longer responsible for managing recyclable waste from businesses, including commercial, industrial and C&D waste. Thus they can no longer collect or treat this waste, with some exceptions, for instance where waste is collected from buildings with both households and businesses. In addition, 23 municipal waste facilities hold permits to continue treating waste from businesses. As municipalities are in charge of waste classification, they are largely free to direct high shares of total waste to the treatment facilities of their choice (e.g. the incinerator they own). What one municipality considers waste may not be classified as such in a neighbouring municipality. Waste classified as recyclable in one municipality is suitable for incineration in another. There have been complaints by private companies and industry sectors about waste classification differing among municipalities, adding to operators’ administrative burden. This lack of harmonisation makes the playing field uneven for enterprises operating across municipal borders. In addition, as the majority of municipalities own or co-own incineration plants and have excess treatment capacity, they tend to direct waste to the incinerator they own. There are no market-based incentives for municipal incinerators to compete on price, environmental performance and efficiency; tipping fees range from about EUR 34 to about EUR 120 per tonne of waste incinerated. The circular economy strategy and political agreement aim at harmonising criteria for waste sorting and collection to create economies of scale. The Utilities for the Future strategy is also expected to increase competition and tendering in the waste incineration sector, which would improve cost-effectiveness. There is some evidence that flow control between 176  II.4. WASTE, MATERIALS MANAGEMENT AND THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 municipalities, resulting in restricted competition in the incineration market, leads to higher treatment costs. A Norwegian study found that the average price charged for treatment of combustible waste where there was competition was less than half that charged for similar waste subject to a monopoly obligation (OECD, 2013[10]). 4.3.4. The information base Denmark is well equipped to monitor trends in waste and materials management, with a comprehensive system on material flows and management in its green national accounts under Statistics Denmark. The green national accounts follow international guidelines such as the Central Framework of the UN System of Environmental-Economic Accounting. They capture flows of natural resources, materials and waste as well as information on natural resource stocks and green economy indicators. Regarding material flows, the green national accounts take an economy-wide approach, with indicators such as DMC, direct material input, imports, exports and resource productivity calculations. Denmark also uses environmentally extended input-output analysis, with input-output tables in monetary units for the various sectors of the economy, and is a front runner in developing this type of data. Statistics Denmark has been working on detailed supply and use tables and input-output tables for 20 years. Annual monetary supply and use tables feature a breakdown of 117 industries and some 2 300 products. More recently, Statistics Denmark developed material flow accounts broken down by industry and households, thanks to extra government funding for 2015-17. This level of detailed data is still in prototype and not fully quality assured or consistent. It is likely to enrich a well-developed information base and help in monitoring progress in the transition towards a circular economy, as well as SDG reporting. Extra funding has also been secured for 2019-20 in conjunction with a project to better incorporate green national accounts into economic models. In 2016, the EPA published a report on material resource productivity with a detailed analysis of recent trends and scenarios for development of resource productivity. A pilot project is under way to develop a raw material consumption indicator measuring all material resources used in the economy, including resource use embedded in imports. The waste information system, an EPA responsibility, improved considerably in 2010 with the launch of a waste data system, AffaldsDataSystemet (ADS), and is now based on a waste management register with mandatory reporting from waste collectors, receivers, exporters and importers. Previously only waste treatment facilities reported waste data, with major consistency and quality assurance issues. Waste operators have to provide information about type of waste, treatment and weight as well as the waste’s origin and planned treatment and destination. Waste is classified according to European List of Waste codes, and waste producers according to industry or NACE codes. Danish authorities use early checks and control systems to improve data quality and the EPA contacts each reporter individually to help improve reports. The country publishes annual waste statistic reports, which are available to the public. ADS data are complemented by data from the Producer Responsibility System (DPA), for instance on WEEE and batteries. The DPA registers quantities of electrical and electronic equipment placed on the market. Denmark carefully monitors transboundary movements, not only of waste that could pose risk to human health and the environment and waste that should be reported to Eurostat, but also overall waste shipments, including green-listed waste exported for recovery. II.4. WASTE, MATERIALS MANAGEMENT AND THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY  177 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 4.3.5. International co-operation and outreach Denmark has established a range of good practices on waste, materials management and circular economy for other countries to learn from. For instance, the Kalundborg green industrial complex (Kalundborg Symbiosis, 2018[11]), a partnership of nine public and private enterprises that formed one of the first examples of industrial symbiosis around the Asnaes power plant, has been an inspiration for the design of eco-industrial parks around the world. The country has well-known research centres promoting best practices in waste management. Technical University of Denmark, for example, promotes life cycle analysis accounting for waste systems and provides software tools and training for waste managers (Dri, M. et al, 2018[12]). The Danish Business Authority is a member of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s CE100 Government and Cities programme to exchange best practices in the transition to a circular economy. The EPA has also contributed to this programme. Denmark was a pilot country for the foundation’s work on a toolkit for policy makers (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2015[13]). Denmark collaborates with other Nordic countries (Finland, Norway, Iceland and Sweden, along with the Faroe Islands, Greenland and the Aland Islands). Two working groups dedicated to waste management (Nordic Waste Group) and sustainable consumption and production were merged in 2019 to form a circular economy working group. Denmark also has bilateral co-operation agreements on waste in the form of memoranda of understanding with countries including Turkey, Indonesia and Kenya. It is active in UN Environment’s work related to implementation of the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Wastes and Their Disposal. It is a contracting party to the 2009 Hong Kong International Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships. 4.4. Promoting waste reduction and recycling 4.4.1. From incineration to higher recycling of municipal waste Denmark has succeeded in diverting municipal waste from landfills using an efficient policy mix of regulatory and economic instruments (EEA, 2016[14]), such as the 1997 ban on landfilling waste that can be incinerated and the gradual increase of the landfill tax (Box 4.2). Policy instruments have been geared towards promoting waste to energy. While the third and fourth waste management plans helped divert waste from landfills, they were not as effective in promoting waste prevention and reduction or encouraging more recycling of household waste. 178  II.4. WASTE, MATERIALS MANAGEMENT AND THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Box 4.2. Taxes on landfilling and incineration Denmark introduced taxes on landfilling and incineration in January 1987 to create incentives to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills and incineration and to increase recycling. The landfill tax per tonne of waste gradually increased from DKK 40 in 1987 (EUR 5.3) to DKK 475 (EUR 64) in 2018 (PwC, 2018[15]). A refund is granted for waste later removed for recycling, so the tax is levied only for waste actually being disposed of. Revenue from the tax was originally earmarked for environmental protection but this is no longer the case. While the landfill tax, combined with a ban on landfilling combustible waste, was instrumental in reducing landfilling levels in the 1990s, it seemed to have limited effect on the amount of waste going to landfill and on recycling rates after 2001 (EEA, 2016[14]). The incineration tax was replaced in 2010 by a tax based on the energy content of the waste. Nowadays a combination of taxes applies to waste incineration:  The waste heating tax is based on the amount of heat produced from waste incineration, including heat used at the plant for indoor heating or water heating. In 2018 this tax amounted to DKK 19.80 (EUR 2.66) per GJ. It is coupled with an additional tax based on heating production according to the energy content of the input waste, which amounts to DKK 26.50 (EUR 3.56) per GJ. These two taxes ensure that the same energy tax rate is levied on heat whether it is generated from waste incineration or fossil fuels, which are subject to energy taxation.  The CO2 tax is levied per tonne of CO2 emissions from waste incineration, except for waste loads containing pure biomass. By 2018 the tax amounted to DKK 173.20 (EUR 23.2) per tonne. In addition, most waste incineration plants take part in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), and pay emission allowances for heat and electricity production. Waste incineration plants are therefore subject to double regulation on CO2 emissions.  Taxes on emissions of NOX and sulphur are imposed on some waste incineration plants. The tax on sulphur emissions is DKK 10.50 (EUR 1.41) per tonne, and that on NOX emissions is DKK 5.10 (EUR 0.68) per tonne (PwC, 2018[15]). Nowadays, the taxes on incineration seem mainly designed to ensure a level playing field in the energy sector while also helping divert waste towards recycling. However, there is no recent analysis on the impact of incineration taxes on recycling rates. In 2010, a per tonne tax on hazardous waste treatment, both incineration and landfill, began being charged. In 2013, it was set at DKK 160 (EUR 21.45); in 2015 it was increased to the level for non-hazardous waste (NCM, 2014[16]). Source: Country submission. Recent pushes towards increased recycling seem directly driven by the introduction of mandatory EU recycling targets and reinforced by the adoption of the EU circular economy package in May 2018. This focus on recycling is starting to deliver in terms of performance, but risks causing financial losses to municipalities left with excess waste to energy capacity. In this context, despite a dedicated strategy for waste prevention, there are still limited incentives to address the high levels of waste generated. II.4. WASTE, MATERIALS MANAGEMENT AND THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY  179 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Towards higher recycling levels for municipal waste… Denmark promotes recycling of municipal waste, starting with separate collection of recyclable waste. A 2009 statutory order on waste requires municipalities to establish separate collection of paper, cardboard and recyclable packaging such as glass, metal and plastic. In addition, municipalities have to follow the EU waste hierarchy when developing their 12-year waste management plans. They thus should give priority to prevention, preparing for reuse, recycling, recovery including energy recovery, and finally disposal. An increasing number of municipalities are setting up additional programmes for sorting other types of waste. For instance, between 2016 and November 2018, the number of municipalities with a system for source separation of organic waste grew from 22 to 40 (out of a total of 98). Nevertheless, households’ behaviour and contribution to waste sorting could still be improved. In 2014, only 60% of Danish respondents reporting separating waste for recycling, below the EU average of 72% (European Commission, 2014[17]). Regional disparities in recycling performance can be observed. Central and Southern Denmark have more advanced recycling practices than North Denmark. However, the differences are minimal. Recycling of household waste is increasing in all Danish regions and particularly quickly in Zealand (Figure 4.10). Figure 4.10. Recycling of household waste is increasing in all Danish regions StatLink 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888934002414 To help municipalities exchange information on best practices, Denmark has set up a web platform (Genanvend, 2018[18]) focusing on household waste recycling.

Exchanging best practices among municipalities: Genanvend platform As municipalities have important waste management responsibilities, they are key to the success of waste strategies. When the 2013 Denmark without Waste: Recycle More, Incinerate Less strategy was launched, municipalities required guidance and assistance to change their waste management methods. At municipalities’ request, a knowledge platform was set up with a dedicated website. Called Genanvend, which means “recycle”, it includes technical reports and inspirational cases from municipalities as well as contact information to facilitate exchanges. It also includes the results of 80 projects financed by the EPA on household waste recycling. In addition to the platform, a dedicated EPA team reached out to municipalities to animate the network and share information on waste collection and recycling. As a result, an increasing number of municipalities started collecting separate household waste fractions such as plastic, cardboard and metal, and Denmark’s household waste recycling rates for plastic, paper, cardboard, glass, metal, wood and organic waste are on course to meet the target of 50% by 2022. Source: (Genanvend, 2018[18]). The midterm evaluation of the waste strategy (EPA, 2017[19]) showed the country on track to meet its objective of increasing recycling of seven fractions of household waste to 50% in 2022. Recycling of plastic, paper, cardboard, glass, metal, wood and organic waste, considered jointly, rose from 22% in 2011 to 36% in 2016, the latest year for which data are available. … and excess capacity for waste to energy Converting waste to energy as efficiently as possible has long been a priority for Denmark, a pioneer in this regard. The first waste incinerator was built in 1903 in Frederiksberg, next to Copenhagen, as an innovative way to create steam and electricity for a nearby hospital. The construction of incineration plants was boosted in the 1970s with installation of district heating infrastructure following the oil crises and in 1997 with the introduction of the ban on landfilling waste suitable for incineration (DAKOFA, 2018[20]). Today, the country is well equipped with waste to energy facilities. It has 23 waste incinerators (including 2 special facilities treating hazardous and other waste) and overall capacity of 4.3 million tonnes. Current waste incineration plants produce around 20% of the country’s district heating and 5% of its electricity consumption (DAKOFA, 2018[20]). The largest incinerator, operated by a publicly owned entity, Vestforbrænding, incinerated around 530 000 tonnes of household and business waste in 2016, leading to production of 1 166 000 MWh of heat and 254 000 MWh of electricity (Vestforbrænding, 2018[21]). The latest plant, in Amager Bakke, started operating in 2017 and has special features such as an artificial ski slope, a hiking slope and a climbing wall, making it a notable attempt to better integrate incineration into public space (Amager Resource Centre, 2018[22]). The plant, with capacity to treat some 560 000 tonnes of waste, replaces an older plant. Such incinerators are presented as a part of Copenhagen's ambition to become zero carbon by 2025. II.4. WASTE, MATERIALS MANAGEMENT AND THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY  181 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 As Denmark moves towards more recycling and less incineration, it is experiencing excess incineration capacity. This is problematic, as incineration costs increase significantly if less waste is processed than the plant was designed for. Hence Denmark imports large amounts of waste for incineration, in particular refuse-derived fuel (RDF) from the United Kingdom, to operate plants efficiently. Imports for incineration increased from 267 000 tonnes in 2014 to 351 000 tonnes in 2016, when they accounted for about 10% of incinerated waste (EPA, 2018[23]) (Table 4.2). Table 4.2. Imports of waste for incineration have more than doubled in recent years Imports of waste suitable for incineration (thousand tonnes) 2013 2014 2015 2016 Germany 9 13 24 50 United Kingdom 98 231 307 276 Ireland 33 11 6 13 Norway 20 11 14 13 Total 160 266 351 352 Share of total waste incineration 5% 8% 10% 10% Source: EPA (2018), Affaldsstatistikken 2016 [Waste Statistics 2016]. Now the UK is extending its own incineration capacity, which could have a major impact on RDF markets. With neighbouring Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden also experiencing excess capacity, and price competition rising, there is a risk that some plants may be forced to close prior to the end of their expected lifespan (Brown, 2016[24]). Other than disseminating good recycling practices, it is unclear how Denmark aims to help municipalities adapt to the changing paradigm (less waste, less incineration, more recycling). This is particularly important as municipalities own most of the waste management infrastructure – 90% of the 40 operating landfills and all 22 dedicated waste incineration facilities – whereas some 300 out of the approximately 350 recycling plants are privately owned. Waste incinerators have been mostly financed through public funding in the form of municipal loans from a special credit institution, Kommunie Kredit, with municipal guarantees. Waste prevention and reduction efforts remain insufficient While recycling of municipal waste is rising, prevention and reduction of household waste remains a critical issue. Indeed, the number of Danes reporting some waste reduction practice is falling. In 2014, 21% of Danes reported reducing waste by avoiding overpackaging or buying products with a longer life span, down from 28% in 2011 and below the EU average of 33% (European Commission, 2014[17]). While Denmark has a policy of full cost recovery for municipal waste collection and management services (Box 4.4), municipalities are responsible for setting waste fees. Several municipalities operate pay-as-you-throw programmes with volume-based waste charges, which encourage waste prevention. Some municipalities have experimented with prepaid refuse bags (Dri, M. et al, 2018[12]). 182  II.4. WASTE, MATERIALS MANAGEMENT AND THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Box 4.4. Municipal waste charges A policy of full cost recovery for municipal waste collection and disposal services is embedded in Denmark’s legal framework (Environmental Protection Act and statutory order on waste). Municipalities thus charge households and companies according to the cost of waste management services and cannot cross-subsidise waste management programmes. Those that charge an overall waste management fee to households must be able to break down the various types of service (administration, waste for incineration, dry recyclables, and hazardous, garden and bulky waste). Within such a framework, municipal waste charges cannot be used to finance waste prevention activities and programmes. Businesses located in buildings that also contain households may take part in the collection of dry recyclables and are charged separately for it. For other private companies, municipalities must offer access to at least one recycling station. The fee for such access can be paid per visit or by subscription. Municipalities may provide collection of waste for incineration, for which businesses would also pay a separate fee. Businesses were formerly charged a municipal fee for administration (e.g. planning, regulation) relating to businesses. This fee was abolished in January 2019, mainly because the cost of administrating it (collection, exemptions and complaints) amounted to almost half of the revenue of the fee. The expenses paid by the fee is now financed through taxes. Around 7% of household waste is avoidable food waste (247 000 tonnes in 2017). This issue is a priority of the waste prevention strategy. A partnership on reducing food waste by businesses, stakeholders and authorities was formed between 2014 and 2017 to identify possible solutions. A subsidy supported projects to reduce food waste in the food value chain through an awareness raising campaign called Check the Date in 2016 and 2018 to better inform people about food labelling. The Food Waste Hunters initiative in 2016-17 engaged with commercial food service kitchens sector on waste reduction opportunities. In 2016, the food donation rules were modified to facilitate such donations from businesses. These efforts are starting to have tangible results: it is estimated that Danish households reduced food waste by 8% per person per year between 2011 and 2017. Plastic waste from households is another priority, although it represents a smaller fraction of household waste (134 000 to 198 000 tonnes in 2016, according to Plastic Europe, but estimates are uncertain). Denmark has several economic instruments to influence this waste stream and in 1993 was one of the first countries to require a fee for carrier bags (paper or plastic). The fee of DKK 22 (EUR 2.9) per kg helped halve consumption of plastic bags, but consumption is still around 445 million bags per year. Denmark also has a fee on single-use tableware (knives, forks, spoons, cups, plates and other items). The objective of both instruments is to influence consumer behaviour towards more durable alternatives. A fee on polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was abolished in 2019. The government published a Plastic Action Plan in December 2018 (Box 4.5). II.4. WASTE, MATERIALS MANAGEMENT AND THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY  183 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Box 4.5. The Plastic Action Plan The Plastic Action Plan was a government proposal that formed the basis for an all-party political agreement in Parliament in January 2019. The political agreement includes a mix of measures, such as product bans, campaigns, voluntary agreements, research and innovation. It aims to promote waste prevention (e.g. through a ban on free plastic carrier bags and thin plastic carrier bags, and criteria on reducing single use plastic at public events), to increase plastic recycling and recyclability, and to both better understand micro-plastics in the environment and reduce the discharge of them by half. Source: Country submission. While waste prevention benefits from a dedicated strategy, waste reduction targets and instruments remain weak: there is no overall objective to reduce waste generation per capita or in absolute terms. Significant market and policy trends (chiefly excess incineration capacity and the focus on securing stable secondary raw material flows to boost recycling and biogas production) contribute to high levels of waste generation. Denmark should balance these trends with stronger incentives for waste prevention. 4.4.2. Extended producer responsibility and deposit-refund programmes Denmark has several extended producer responsibility programmes mandated by EU requirements, and outperforms EU recycling targets in most instances. It established an independent entity, DPA-system (DPA System, 2018[25]), as a clearinghouse to manage the work of producer responsibility organisations (PROs). Aside from that, the involvement and steering role of public authorities in extended producer responsibility is limited. Enhancing design for environment via such programmes is seen as difficult. WEEE and batteries In accordance with EU directives, Denmark mandated extended producer responsibility for WEEE in 2006 and for batteries in 2009. For both waste streams, producers are responsible for the financial and organisational aspects of collecting and treating waste corresponding to their market share. Other obligations include labelling products, informing consumers on waste management, complying with the national producer register and reporting waste statistics. Producers can choose between managing their duties individually or joining a PRO to act on their behalf. They have to ensure that minimum collection, recovery and recycling targets are met. These are set in accordance with EU legislation. While Denmark does not regulate or intervene in the business models of PROs, it has set up DPA-system as a clearing house to handle producer registration and monitor the amount of electronic and electrical equipment (EEE) put on the market and collected for treatment. Such a system is usually considered to be among OECD best practices, as it helps co-ordinate the PROs’ work and ensure a level playing field for operators. It also ensures that collection is provided everywhere it is needed and that cherry picking of easily accessible or valuable WEEE is avoided. Producers pay a yearly administrative fee to DPA-system. Of the four PROs operating in Denmark, two are private commercial entities (ERP Denmark and RENE) and two are non-profit associations with EEE producers on the board 184  II.4. WASTE, MATERIALS MANAGEMENT AND THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 of directors (LWF and Elretur). As municipalities are in charge of establishing collection points for WEEE and batteries, DPA-system allocates municipal sites annually to producers and PROs. Some PROs have established collection systems via retailers. While Denmark far exceeded EU recovery/reuse and recycling targets in 2016 for WEEE and batteries (Table 4.3), collection rates were less impressive (48% of marketed EEE and 45% of batteries; the EU target is 45% for each waste stream). Collection of WEEE peaked in 2007 at 98 000 tonnes and has stabilised at around 72 000 tonnes per year since 2013 (Table 4.4). Table 4.3.

As in other OECD countries, important WEEE flows are disappearing from official collection systems, especially WEEE of high value. In 2013, the Electronic Waste Collection Partnership was set up to enhance collection rates and map all flows of WEEE, including those not entering the official system. The partnership carried out several projects to estimate the amount of used EEE exported to third countries, amounts accumulated in society due to consumer behaviour, and thefts from municipal collection points and recycling sites. It is estimated that 50% of WEEE is collected outside the official system (MEF and MIBFA, 2018[7]). To overcome such difficulties, the circular economy strategy and political agreement proposes allowing additional certified companies (which are in effect already operating on the market) to collect WEEE directly from households for reuse and recycling.

End-of-life vehicles The extended producer responsibility programme for ELVs was set up in 2007 and applies to old and new cars sold in Denmark. Importers or manufacturers have to ensure that consumers can hand over their used vehicles to be treated in an environmentally sound manner free of charge. In addition, registration in the producer register handled by DPA-system is compulsory. Car importers have established a PRO called Refero to handle their producer obligations including reporting and information obligations. The programme is complemented by a scrapping allowance (around DKK 2 200) paid when a used car is delivered to an approved car dealer. The allowance applies only to private cars and vans registered in Denmark after 1 July 2000. In 2017, Denmark restructured its taxation of cars to facilitate repair. A high registration tax is charged on all vehicles, including those that are put back on the market after major repair. Repair limits to determine if the registration tax is due will be gradually increased from 2018 to 2020 to facilitate repair. Denmark meets the EU reuse and recovery target of 95% for ELVs and has exceeded the 85% target for recovery and recycling (Table 4.5). Table 4.5.

Packaging waste Denmark achieves high levels of recycling and recovery of packaging waste and this waste stream is experiencing positive trends. Denmark has already met the 2030 recycling target of 70% included in the recent EU circular economy package (Table 4.6). 186  II.4.

Source: Country submission. Denmark has applied a deposit system for refillable beverage containers since 1910. Since 2000, the system has been operated by Danskretursystem (The Danish Deposit System: Danskretursytem, 2018[26]), a privately owned non-profit organisation. In 2002, the deposit system was extended to some single use beverage containers (NCM, 2014[16]). The return rate of beverage containers covered by the system (beer, soda, cider, mineral water, lemonade and iced tea) is 90%. The country is well equipped with reverse vending machines. Operating fees paid by importers and producers make up 45% of the system’s revenue and the resale of materials such as plastic, glass and aluminium accounts for 24%. Surplus revenue from deposit funds, which occurs when a beverage container is not returned to a store despite payment of the deposit, represents 29%. The new plastic action plan proposes extending the deposit system in 2020 to include juice and fruit drink concentrate bottles. Denmark also applies a volume-based tax on packaging waste from several types of beverage container (wine, liquor, beer, mineral water, cider, soda with alcohol, fruit wine). Items included in the deposit-return system are taxed at a lower rate. While the country does not have an extended producer responsibility programme for packaging, it plans to develop one by 2025 as a requirement of the 2018 EU circular economy package. 4.4.3. Towards higher-quality recycling of construction and demolition waste Construction and demolition waste makes up a majority of total waste generation (54%, including soil). EPA forecasts indicate C&D waste amounts could nearly double by 2030 (Deloitte, 2015[27]). Nearly half of domestic national material consumption is non-metallic minerals, including stone, gravel and sand extracted for construction activities. This makes C&D a key strategic sector for the transition to a circular economy. Policy instruments to promote resource efficiency in the construction sector include a tax of DKK 5 per m3 on volume of extracted raw material. The level is so low that it does not affect waste prevention, however. Denmark recovers most C&D waste (87% in 2016), demonstrating a long-standing effort to promote recycling for this waste stream and to limit contamination by substances of concern. The weight-based landfill tax and the ability to recover sorted, unpolluted and processed C&D waste without a permit under the Environmental Protection Act have been key factors in this regard (Deloitte, 2015[27]). To limit contamination of the waste stream by substances of concern for health and the environment, the EPA supported studies and guidance documents for treating contaminated waste such as PCBs. Screening for PCBs is mandatory when demolishing or refurbishing a building dating from 1950 to 1977, to allow for separate removal and appropriate disposal of PCB-containing material. Such mandatory auditing and mapping of buildings or II.4. WASTE, MATERIALS MANAGEMENT AND THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY  187 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 structures to be demolished, dismantled or refurbished is considered a best environmental practice for C&D waste (Dri, M. et al, 2018[12]). Despite high recycling rates, recovery activities are still low-value operations, mainly using crushed concrete and bricks to replace stone and gravel. To foster higher-quality recycling, Denmark is embarking on a circular agenda for construction, promoting reuse and selective demolition, and support initiatives to create momentum in this respect. Mechanisms to mobilise stakeholders with public support have enhanced dialogue in the construction value chain (Box 4.6). The Danish Eco-Innovation Programme has funded several knowledge platforms and networks on sustainable construction as well as technology developments on waste prevention in the building sector and on C&D waste. 188  II.4. WASTE, MATERIALS MANAGEMENT AND THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Box 4.6. Platforms to mobilise the construction sector on a circular economy agenda  A partnership on sustainable construction and waste prevention was established in 2016 to foster collaboration between operators in the construction value chain, relevant authorities, and stakeholder organisations. It focused on practical solutions in two main areas: selective demolition and fostering an effective market for recycled building materials.  The Knowledge Centre for Managing and Recycling Building Waste was founded in 2016 on the initiative of the Danish Construction Association. It is financed by MEF, the Landowners’ Investment Foundation and Realdania, a private association in Denmark which supports projects in architecture and planning. The centre guides building owners, contractors, advisers and municipalities on recycling of C&D waste and on problematic substances in rebuilding, renovation and demolition. In January 2019, it was renamed the Knowledge Centre for Circular Economy in Construction.  The advisory board on circular economy drew up the following innovative and ambitious recommendations for the building sector between autumn 2016 and summer 2017: o additional information requirements for amounts of reused, recycled and recyclable materials and for undesirable substances in new buildings and large renovation projects from 2020, with a voluntary sustainability classification system for buildings becoming mandatory in 2025 o a standardised, freely available digital building passport, plus a product database for suppliers with digital factsheets for building products o a selective demolition plan to identify materials and the content of hazardous substances, assess materials’ recycling/reuse value and specify demolition methods o public building procurement based on total costs and life-cycle calculations. Several Danish stakeholder networks are active in the area of sustainable construction and management of C&D waste. Initiatives include:  a network for construction waste established by the Danish Waste and Resource Network in 2012  Sustainable Build, a collaboration between the Danish Industry Foundation and the Danish Architectural Centre to promote sustainable architecture. The Danish construction industry established the Innovation Network for Sustainable Construction (InnoBYG), co-financed by the Danish Agency for Institutions and Educational Grants, to focus on knowledge sharing, networking and development in the industry in Denmark and internationally. Realdania launched the “Circular Construction Challenge: Rethink Waste” in October 2018, calling for innovative ways to reuse, recycle and upcycle1 waste for the built environment. The teams of architects and planners that come up with the best ideas for turning waste into a valuable resource through innovative use and design will receive substantial long-term development support. Source: Country submission. II.4. WASTE, MATERIALS MANAGEMENT AND THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY  189 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Among the various knowledge-sharing platforms and networks, the 2016 partnership on sustainable construction and waste prevention was instrumental in identifying practical barriers and common solutions to promote selective demolition and establish effective markets for recycled building materials. Stakeholders called for practical tools such as platforms to help match supply and demand, compilation of standards and guidance documents, demonstration projects focusing on cost, and more strategic use of green public procurement. This paved the way for the advisory board on circular economy, which made several innovative and ambitious recommendations for the building sector. These included new information requirements for new buildings and large-scale renovation projects (on amounts of reused, recycled and recyclable materials), digital passports for buildings, mandatory selective demolition plans, and public procurement based on total costs during the life cycle of a building (Box 4.6). Some were picked up in the national circular economy strategy, including a voluntary sustainability classification for buildings. The strategy is less ambitious on other aspects, however, such as mandatory information requirements and selective demolition plans. Instead, it notes that many companies fail to comply with existing requirements to sort C&D waste. Hence enforcement activities are likely to be strengthened. 4.5. Fostering the transition to a circular economy Denmark has long paved the way for circular economy approaches by promoting sustainable consumption, eco-design, clean production and eco-innovation as well as green purchasing by the public sector. A 2015 study estimated that improving circular economy opportunities in five key areas (food and beverage, construction and real estate, machinery, plastic packaging and hospitals) could lead to an increase in GDP by between 0.8% to 1.4% and help create 7 000 to 13 000 jobs in Denmark (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2015[13]). In September 2018, Denmark adopted the national circular economy strategy with its 15 initiatives. The focus is largely on how companies can drive the circular economy agenda, with measures to assist them (one-stop shop, access to financing, digitalisation). As part of its circular economy efforts, Denmark has also pledged to develop a bio-based economy, one based on using renewable biological resources to produce food, materials and energy. The construction sector has also been identified as a priority. 4.5.1. Promoting sustainable consumption and the sharing economy Denmark has a long history of mechanisms to promote sustainable consumption through labelling and information campaigns. In 2012, it was estimated that 90% of Danish inhabitants knew about the Nordic Swan eco-label and 35% about the other official third-party verified label, the EU eco-label, and that 8 000 eco-labelled products were available. Not surprisingly, the share of Danes who say they buy eco-friendly products, at 48% in 2014, is second only to Sweden (60%) and trending up (from 39% in 2011) (European Commission, 2014[17]). As part of the strategy on the sharing economy, citizens are encouraged to use sharing platforms with tax reductions on income from sharing activities. While most projects relate to use of assets such as car and lodging, some may have a more direct impact on waste management. For instance, on the meal-sharing platform, individuals can sell private meals as a P2P business model, and on a business platform called Too Good to Go grocery stores can sell food cheaply instead of throwing it out (B2C). 190  II.4. WASTE, MATERIALS MANAGEMENT AND THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 4.5.2. Promoting markets for recycling and secondary raw materials The recycling market is characterised by small facilities handling materials such as glass, wood, plastic, construction materials, electronics, metal and textiles. Turnover of recycling activities in 2016 was estimated at DKK 4.8 billion and value added at DKK 0.9 billion. Apart from glass packaging, most recyclable waste is exported for recycling, especially cardboard, plastic, electronics and treated wood. Municipalities and the private sector alike are considering expanding recycling capacity in Denmark. Many private operators claim, however, that they are holding back investment due to fragmentation of the recyclables market. While private recycling companies have access to commercial waste, municipalities have a monopoly for managing household waste and tend to favour their own facilities. Uncertainty regarding access to recyclable waste may thus slow down development in waste sorting and recycling and lead to suboptimal investment strategies, with some duplication of efforts between municipalities and the private sector. For instance, in Odense on the island of Funen (Fyn), a private company invested EUR 13 million to develop a recycling plant for food waste from supermarkets, separating the plastic for reuse and the bio-based content to produce energy. The Odense city council is planning a public tender to build and operate a similar plant to treat municipal household waste, which private operators say could duplicate and jeopardise the private investment. In this context, the 2016 Utilities for the Future strategy proposes an in-depth reorganisation of the waste management sector by increasing competition for incineration and giving the private sector a greater role in waste collection and recycling. Discussions over practical implementation have stalled, however, and uncertainty may deter private and public investment for the circular economy. Another aspect under discussion as part of the circular economy strategy is the need to better harmonise collection of recyclable fractions of household waste to promote economies of scale. 4.5.3. Green public procurement Denmark has developed a wide range of policy instruments to promote green public procurement. They range from regulatory instruments (mandatory purchasing rules) to voluntary initiatives and information campaigns (Box 4.7). A national smart public procurement strategy (Government of Denmark, 2013[28]) was launched in 2013, adapting and incorporating the EU indicative target of making 50% of all public tendering procedures green. In 2012, it was estimated that between 60% and 80% of public tenders included green criteria in Denmark, while their value was between 20% and 40% of the public procurement budget. II.4. WASTE, MATERIALS MANAGEMENT AND THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY  191 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Box 4.7. Denmark has a well-developed strategy on green public procurement  Regulatory instruments: Mandatory green public procurement rules are in place for timber, energy-using products and road transport vehicles.  Voluntary instruments: The Partnership for Green Public Procurement is a free voluntary initiative that gathers 15 partners, including municipalities, regions and central authorities. Partners commit to adopt a green procurement strategy and common green procurement goals for product categories including building and construction, food, timber, information technology, paper and printing, and cleaning supplies. Purchasing criteria, including recyclability, recycled content and toxic content, have been defined for these categories. Together the partners account for 20% of Danish public procurement.  Information and knowledge sharing instruments: The Responsible Purchaser website, for both public and private purchasers, gathers guidance and tools including the European Commission’s green public procurement criteria and an EPA tool on total cost of ownership. An open platform called Forum on Sustainable Procurement disseminates knowledge and news on sustainable procurement and organises thematic working groups to discuss challenges and barriers to sustainable procurement. The strategy has helped the country develop innovative tools to promote alternative business models for the circular economy and green purchasing, such as the EPA guidance on total cost of ownership. This tool allows public and private procurement agents to take into account the price of both initial purchase and operation. The EPA is expanding the tool to include the cost of waste disposal. 4.5.4. Promoting circular business models and innovation While regulatory instruments on product design are an EU responsibility (related to product requirements and bans on substances of concern), Denmark has set up a wide range of other policy instruments to promote circular business models. Information and dissemination of good practices include EPA publication of case studies on resource efficiency in businesses, for instance in the book Stronger without Waste. A web portal for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the Circular Company, was launched in September 2017. A one-stop shop on the sharing economy provides advice and guidance to companies and citizens on regulatory aspects. The circular economy strategy also envisages a single point of entry on the circular economy in general. Subsidies and co-financing programmes are available to assist companies with development of products or circular business models and to provide education and training to SMEs. Circular economy projects can benefit from the main eco-innovation finance programmes, the Eco-Innovation Programme and the Green Investment fund. In addition, some grant and co-financing programmes are dedicated to the circular economy, such as Circular Business Model and Circular Business (Box 4.8). In addition to information instruments and financing programmes, Denmark is attempting to use economic instruments to favour business models based on product reuse/recycling and discourage single-use products. For example, disposable tableware is subject to taxation based on volume (DKK 19.20 per kg). 192  II.4. WASTE, MATERIALS MANAGEMENT AND THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Despite the wide range of initiatives, circular business practices are far from common among SMEs. A September 2017 survey of European SMEs on resource efficiency and green markets in the EU between 2015 and 2017 (European Commission, 2018[29]), Denmark reports the largest decline in SMEs declaring waste minimisation and companies recycling or reusing waste internally. In 2017, 49% of Danish SMEs declared that they minimised waste (the EU average is 65%) and 29% claimed to recycle waste internally (compared with the EU average of 42%). Box 4.8. Support for circular economy innovation Denmark has several financing programmes to support the transition to a circular economy in businesses, particularly SMEs.  The Danish Eco-Innovation Program is a public subsidy programme supporting development and application of new environmental and resource-efficient solutions in selected priority areas, along with co-operation between companies and knowledge-based institutions. The 2018 budget was about DKK 86 million (EUR 12 million).  The Danish Green Investment Fund (Danmarks Grønne Investeringsfond) is an independent state loan fund which co-finances economically viable projects to bridge the gap between traditional bank financing and equity capital (Chapter 3). It is open to private companies, non-profit housing associations and public sector companies and institutions (with budgets separate from municipalities, regions and the state).  Circular Business Models (Cirkulære Forretningsmodeller) is a co-financing programme for SMEs to implement circular business models. It is co-ordinated with a partnership of business organisations. The budget for 2018-22 is EUR 15 million.  Circular Business (Cirkular Forretning) is a grant programme for business organisations to help them train their SME members on circular economy. II.4. WASTE, MATERIALS MANAGEMENT AND THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY  193 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Recommendations on waste, material management and the circular economy Reinforce waste prevention as a key priority  For household waste, expand pricing based on volume or weight – as in pay-as-you-throw programmes – while facilitating recycling and composting.  Accelerate R&D on sorting and recycling technology and innovative reusable and recyclable materials (e.g. biopolymers).  Develop policies to minimise output of single-use products, such as plastics. Foster competition in incineration and better manage excess capacity  Improve the cost-effectiveness of incineration by reforming municipal waste management, giving companies flexibility to choose where to incinerate their combustible waste and making public tenders mandatory for municipal waste incineration. Continue efforts to steer the transition to a circular economy  Harmonise criteria for sorting and collecting municipal waste fractions and consider unifying household and business recyclable waste markets to create economies of scale and encourage investment in innovation and large-scale recycling facilities.  Foster circular product design by introducing eco-modulation of fees in extended producer responsibility systems, based on recyclability, reparability and reusability.  Continue encouraging circular design by SMEs (e.g. through training and access to finance) and supporting companies in establishing take-back programmes and circular business models, e.g. with closed loops for products and materials.  Promote voluntary agreements between business and government on circular economy, ensuring that the objectives go beyond what is required by law.  Encourage voluntary initiatives and pilot projects to reduce “downcycling” (recycling that produces material of lesser quality and functionality than the original material) in the construction, textile and plastic sectors.  Secure financing to develop data for circular economy (e.g. green accounts and material flow information for industry sectors). Notes 1 Upcycling can be defined as the process of recycling waste into new materials or products of better quality and environmental value. 194  II.4.

CHEMICALS MANAGEMENT  197 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Chapter 5. Chemicals management This chapter reviews Denmark’s chemicals management framework, with a particular focus on industrial chemicals. It analyses pressures from chemicals on health and the environment in Denmark and the country’s involvement in chemicals management at the regional and global levels. The Danish framework is part of the broader EU context, and a significant part of chemicals management is regulated at that level. This chapter does not focus on EU-level polices, but highlights Danish contributions to implementation and complementary activities at the national level. The statistical data for Israel are supplied by and under the responsibility of the relevant Israeli authorities. The use of such data by the OECD is without prejudice to the status of the Golan Heights, East Jerusalem and Israeli settlements in the West Bank under the terms of international law. 198  II.5. CHEMICALS MANAGEMENT OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 5.1. Introduction The main drivers of Danish activity in the area of chemicals management include protection of the public (with a focus on consumers and vulnerable groups) and substitution of dangerous chemicals. They respond to major pressures for health and the environment from the use of chemicals in the country (e.g. reliance on imported goods, in particular products, along with low fertility and vulnerability of children and the elderly to chemical exposure). Synergy exists in the activities of the authorities, industry and society, and Denmark has a robust chemicals management framework. Some areas could benefit from further enhancement or improvement, as this chapter will show. 5.2. Pressures on health and the environment from chemicals Denmark has a relatively small and export-oriented chemical industry. The number of hazardous installations has been relatively stable and the country faced few major accidents in the last decade. Denmark achieved significant emission reductions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), acidifying gases, air pollutants and heavy metals from industrial processes and product use. The country’s system of chemical monitoring in the environment supports identifying its priorities in relation to chemicals management and efforts to address pressures from chemicals on health and the environment. Despite this, pressures persist (e.g. from endocrine disrupters and pesticides). 5.2.1. Chemical production and use In 2016, the Danish chemical industry accounted for about 1% of the EU market. It consisted of 245 chemical companies with 11 400 employees and total turnover of EUR 5.5 billion. Danish companies’ share of research and development within the EU chemical industry is higher at EUR 670 million or 3% (CEFIC, 2018[1]). Investment in the broad chemical sector (including pharmaceuticals, oil refining, rubber and plastic products and non-metallic mineral products) almost doubled in 2010 prices between 2007 and 2015. The chemical industry is largely export oriented: some 65% of production is exported and the broad chemical sector is the country’s second largest export sector, after machinery and transport equipment. The Danish share in beyond-EU exports placed it at ninth place in 2017. The value of sales of chemicals and pharmaceuticals increased between 2007 and 2018 by over 90%, with the pharmaceutical sector as the main driver (Figure 5.1). The import and export of chemicals have shown fairly stable growth (except in 2009). Denmark is a net exporter of some chemicals (e.g. organic chemicals, chemical materials and products) and a net importer of others (e.g. inorganic chemicals, primary plastics) (Denmark, 2018[2]; Eurostat, 2018[3]). Data from the national product registry, which covers not only manufacturers but also users of chemicals, show that the number of companies issuing chemical product notifications, the number of substances and products and total tonnage in 2015 did not differ substantially from 2005 (Denmark, 2018[2]). Sales of pesticides and biocides (in tonnes/year) generally decreased by about 12% between 2007 and 2016 due to actions by the authorities to limit their use. A tax on pesticides introduced in 2013 resulted in stockpiling of certain pesticides and lower-than-usual sales in the following years. The lower sales may not be indicative of lower use over the short term (Ørum and Holtze, 2017[4]; Denmark, 2018[2]). II.5. CHEMICALS MANAGEMENT  199 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Figure 5.1. A pharmaceuticals boom stimulated growth in the chemical sector StatLink 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888934002433 Chemical facilities are spread relatively evenly around the country, but concentrated near the biggest cities: Aalborg, Aarhus, Copenhagen, Esbjerg and Odense. However, relatively bigger facilities are overwhelmingly located in the greater Copenhagen area (EEA, 2018[5]; Denmark, 2018[2]). 5.2.2. A stable number of hazardous facilities and visible efforts in reducing emissions of chemicals The number of Danish installations classified as hazardous under the applicable EU legislation has been relatively stable. There are about 120, of which some 45% are upper tier installations (more hazardous) and some 35% fuel storage facilities (above the EU average of 11%, but in line with national policy to secure fuel supplies). Denmark expands the scope of application of the EU rules to also cover smaller installations (i.e. chlorine and ammonia installations), so the total number of hazardous installations is almost 140. Information on hazardous establishments is publicly available via a dedicated website (Denmark, 2018[2]; EMA, 2017[6]). Since 2005, Denmark has reported only two industrial accidents to the e-MARS chemical accident reporting database; they resulted in one casualty and damage to a marine habitat (Denmark, 2018[2]). The biggest accident in recent times, an explosion in a fireworks storage facility, took place in 2004. Post-accident action led to enhanced enforcement and amendment of national legislation. Moreover, Denmark proposed enhanced standardisation at the European level (French Ministry for Sustainable Development, 2009[7]; EMA, 2017[6]). The relatively stable number of major hazardous installations and low number of accidents suggest that measures to prevent major chemical accidents work relatively well in Denmark.

Reducing emissions of chemicals is a strategic goal included in relevant legal and policy frameworks in Denmark. The Environmental Protection Act and Act on Chemicals set the overall goal of reducing pollution caused by chemical production and use, while national action plans include implementation measures (MEF, 2017[8]; Government of Denmark et al., 2017[9]). Denmark reduced emissions of GHGs1 from industrial processes and product use by over 20% between 2005 and 2016. Significant reductions also occurred for acidifying gases, air pollutants and heavy metals2 in industrial processes and product use and in manufacturing industries and construction (Figure 5.2). Figure 5.2. Emissions from industrial processes and product use are generally on the decline StatLink 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888934002452 5.2.3. Despite monitoring of chemicals, pressures on health and the environment are significant Denmark has a system of monitoring chemicals in the environment that supports identification of the country’s priorities in relation to chemicals management. It includes a pollutant release and transfer register. Denmark has undertaken biomonitoring activities and co-operates with other countries in this field.

Examples of chemical monitoring/biomonitoring results that have helped shape Danish chemicals management priorities  Studies showed that 40% of the male population had reduced semen quality; it is suspected that exposure to phthalates contributed to this result (EPA, 2013[10]).  A cohort study of non-persistent environmental chemicals suspected of endocrine-disrupting properties concluded that nearly everyone in the population might be exposed to the monitored chemicals and that EU-wide restrictions had had a positive effect in Denmark. For instance, decreasing excretion of the phthalates DnBP and DEHP was observed following the introduction of restrictions on food contact materials and toys (Choi et al., 2015[11]; Denmark, 2018[2]; Frederiksen et al., 2014[12]). Increased public awareness contributed to decreased use.  DEMOCOPHES revealed that Danes were widely exposed to PCBs (mostly from food) and PFAS (used, for example, in food packaging, non-stick coatings and textile coatings) (Choi et al., 2015[11]; Mørck et al., 2015[13]; Denmark, 2018[2])  In the work of CEHOS, the effects of perinatal bisphenol A exposure on both male and female rat sexual development were identified at doses that could warrant a decrease in the tolerable daily intake of this substance (Bourguignon, Hutchinson and Slama, 2017[14]).  Danish biomonitoring results were included in the restriction proposal for four phthalates jointly issued in 2016 by Denmark and the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) (Denmark, 2018[2]).  A 2012-15 initiative on better control of nanomaterials found, among other conclusions, that inhalation of nanomaterials might constitute a risk (Christensen et al., 2015[15]).  In 2015, the Danish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requested an evaluation of health hazards from exposure to PFAS. This led to establishment of limit values for 12 PFAS in soil, drinking water and groundwater, and to further monitoring and screening activities (OECD[16])  In 2016, pesticides and their metabolites were found in 34.3% of groundwater samples and in concentrations exceeding the quality standard of 0.1 ug/l in 8.6% of samples (reduced from 37.3% and 13.6%, respectively, in 2007). The data for 2017 showed a slight increase, but the data set differed significantly from previous years (GEUS, 2019[17]). This outcome led to actions at national level to expand the scope of monitoring.  Concentration of zinc in agricultural soils increased by 19% between 1998 and 2014 and some 25% of streams had zinc concentrations above the environmental quality standard. The situation is expected to worsen due to the elevated concentration of zinc in manure from pig farming (Jensen and Bak, 2018[18]).  National Allergy Research Centre research supported regulatory action on chromium in leather and methylisothiazolinone in cosmetics (Denmark, 2018[2]). 202  II.5. CHEMICALS MANAGEMENT OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 A key tool to monitor chemicals in the Danish environment is the National Monitoring and Assessment Programme for the Aquatic and Terrestrial Environment (NOVANA), established in 2004. It analyses pollution sources, trends, policy actions and environmental pressures in various categories (surface water, sediment, biota, groundwater, air and point sources, wastewater and rainwater installations), in particular to support compliance with Danish and EU legislation and international conventions. Since its inception, the programme has been adapted to evolving EU policies (e.g. Natura 2000, river basin management plans, emission ceilings). In the current monitoring period, 2017-21, it covers more than 250 substances in one or more categories and with varying monitoring frequency, e.g. 25 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), 13 per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), 20 metals, 17 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 8 plasticisers, 20 pharmaceuticals, and 66 pesticides and their metabolites. Denmark also monitors persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and heavy metal levels in the Arctic (EPA, AU and GEUS, 2017[19]; Denmark, 2018[2]). As pesticide exposure remains a cause of concern, there are dedicated monitoring subprogrammes, including the National Groundwater Monitoring Programme and the Pesticide Leaching Assessment Programme. Denmark has also undertaken and supported efforts to address emerging issues of concern, such as the presence in the environment of antibiotics (antibiotic resistance was identified in 2017 as one of the country’s four key risk challenges) and micro plastic (EUSBSR, 2017[20]; Løkkegaard et al., 2017[21]; Denmark, 2018[2]; EMA, 2017[6]). As the country relies for its drinking water on groundwater that is not chemically treated (it is subject only to aeration and sand filtration), particular focus on enhanced monitoring is needed in this area. A key concern is so-called legacy pesticides (and their metabolites), no longer authorised for use in Denmark but found in groundwater sources. Denmark would benefit from further enhancement of pesticide and legacy pesticide monitoring in groundwater and under the Pesticide Leaching Assessment Programme. It should also consider supplementing its actions with surface water monitoring (relevant for biocides), in line with the recommendations of its national expert-based water panel. In January 2019, Denmark announced that pesticide monitoring in groundwater would be expanded (MEF, 2019[22]), which should be applauded. Denmark should also consider enhanced monitoring of emerging pollutants (e.g. pharmaceuticals in surface and groundwater) and heavy metals (e.g. zinc in soil and water). Biomonitoring Denmark does not have a long-term biomonitoring programme for environmental chemicals like those in, for instance, Germany and the USA.3 However, it is a one of the relatively few countries that have undertaken biomonitoring for non-occupationally exposed populations and it co-operates with other countries in this field within the EU framework. Both public and private sources, but mainly the latter, finance this work. Denmark collaborated with 16 other European countries in the DEMOCOPHES project (DEMOnstration of a study to COordinate and Perform Human biomonitoring on a European Scale) on exposure to bisphenol A, other phenols, parabens, cadmium, cotinine and phthalate metabolites in urine, POPs in blood and mercury in hair. It also funded supplementary actions to increase knowledge of exposure of its population to potential endocrine disrupting chemicals (Mørck et al., 2015[23]; Denmark, 2018[2]). And it currently participates in the EU flagship human biomonitoring project, HBM4EU. Launched in 2017, the project aims to harmonise exposure assessment methods based on biomonitoring II.5. CHEMICALS MANAGEMENT  203 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 data. In 2017, Denmark hosted a Nordic workshop to discuss priorities for the project (HBM4EU[24]; Knudsen and Hansen, 2017[25]). The Danish action plan on industrial chemicals (Section 5.3.1) includes biomonitoring in the context of endocrine disruptors. An external evaluation of the Danish Centre for Endocrine Disrupting Substances (CEHOS) recommended in 2017 that the country should increase public investment in biomonitoring (Bourguignon, Hutchinson and Slama, 2017[14]). Denmark would benefit from enhanced biomonitoring, taking into account the trade-offs needed to balance it with predictive risk assessment to proactively identify chemicals that require regulatory action before a negative impact can be detected in humans or the environment. These actions should take into account a science/policy nexus, for instance supporting identification of the source of exposure or aligning the efforts with Denmark’s regulatory priorities (e.g. under the EU REACH Regulation). Consumers and workers To ensure a high level of protection of the public (particularly consumers and workers) from risk related to chemicals, Danish research centres, supported by public resources, are undertaking activities to monitor and prevent risk in relation to:  endocrine disruptors (CEHOS and the International Centre for Research and Research Training in Endocrine Disruption of Male Reproduction and Child Health)  allergies to chemicals (the National Allergy Research Centre)  the impact of chemicals on occupational health (Working Environment Research Fund) (Denmark, 2018[2]). Pollutant release and transfer register Danish companies have reported environmental information via so-called green accounts since 1995. In 2008, Denmark ratified the Kiev Protocol on Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers to the Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters. It was implemented through the 2006 EU Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR) Regulation and national legislation. The EU/Danish PRTR covers 91 substances and some 65 economic activities. It includes 90 out of 126 chemicals from the OECD harmonised list of pollutants (OECD, 2014[26]). Danish reporting to the E-PRTR started in 2007 and to the Kiev Protocol in 2010. PRTR data are complemented by estimating emissions for substances with diffuse sources. Since 2012, geographical mapping of emissions from Danish diffuse sources in the PRTR has been publicly available (AU, 2018[27]). Companies report measured, calculated or estimated data annually to the PRTR, usually via a one-stop portal.4 The EPA provides technical support. Companies, local authorities and the EPA contribute to data quality assurance. No overall assessment of the submitted data has yet done; such an assessment could help authorities understand the completeness and relevance of the data (MEF, 2016[28]). PRTR data are available to the public via the national PRTR register or the E-PRTR portal; national reports are subject to public consultation. Both registers offer a wide choice of search options (MEF, 2016[28]). The scope of PRTR reporting was visibly reduced in the review period. Regulatory changes (modifying green account reporting in 2010 and abolishing it in 2015 in favour of a separate national regulatory framework for the PRTR) (EPA[29]) led to a reduction of the economic activities covered as well as strict application of E-PRTR scope and thresholds. The number of companies reporting environmental information in the green accounts and the PRTR fell 204  II.5. CHEMICALS MANAGEMENT OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 by 52% between 2007 and 2014; the number of Danish companies in the E-PRTR dropped by 48% between 2007 and 2016 (Figure 5.3) (EEA, 2018[5]; EPA[30]). The number of chemical industry facilities reporting dropped almost by half (from 49 to 25), mostly following the 2015 abolition of green accounts (EEA, 2018[5]; EPA[30]). Fewer reporting companies means less information available for the authorities and stakeholders (e.g. companies and general public). This can contribute to the reduced ability of Denmark’s PRTR system to provide comprehensive data on emissions that could support broader decision making. Figure 5.3. The number of Danish companies reporting to the E-PRTR and national PRTR/green account programmes has fallen StatLink 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888934002471 5.3. Policy, regulatory and institutional frameworks Denmark has a comprehensive policy and regulatory framework consisting of EU and national legal instruments, with national rules sometimes exceeding the EU rules’ scope. Denmark manages all enforcement activities on chemicals at the national level and co-operates at the regional level in this field. Stakeholders are actively involved in chemicals management, and the use of economic analysis in decision making is on the rise. EU membership had direct, comprehensive implications for the Danish legal system in the review period, for instance through introduction of the new EU horizontal legislation (applying to all chemicals not regulated by specific regimes) for industrial chemicals: the REACH Regulation and Classification, Labelling and Packaging (CLP) Regulation. However, the influence does not go just one way. Denmark has actively and rather successfully pursued its national objectives on chemicals both at the EU level and in a broader international context. 5.3.1.

CHEMICALS MANAGEMENT  205 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 objectives and pressures. They take into account policy documents adopted at the EU level, notably the Environmental Action Programmes (EAPs). General chemicals management At the national level, since 2005 Denmark has prepared and implemented strategic policy documents related to general chemicals management. They take the form of four-year action plans, currently called the Chemical Initiatives. Negotiations between the government and main political parties outside government precede adoption of these policy documents. This approach secures a broad commitment from the political level, along with medium-term resources, to prioritise chemicals management. The current action plan covers 2018-21 (Box 5.2). Box 5.2. Danish Chemical Initiatives 2018-21 The 2018-21 Chemical Initiatives, agreed by all parties in the Danish Parliament, build on previous plans and set the following priorities for national actions regarding chemicals:  credible information to consumers on chemicals (with particular attention to chemicals in products, vulnerable groups, and food and food packaging)  a level playing field for enterprises, particularly effective regulation of chemicals and good enforcement, with a particular focus on promotion of standard setting for Danish companies, better data quality, imported products, and support to SMEs  initiatives on five groups of chemicals of concern – substances that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction; chemicals affecting brain development; endocrine-disrupting chemicals; allergenic chemicals; and chemicals of high concern for the environment  research and knowledge building (in particular on endocrine disruptors). The plan supports Denmark in meeting its obligations under the EU acquis on chemicals and the international agreements in this field. Source: (Government of Denmark et al., 2017[9]). Danish action plans on chemicals can serve as a best practice example. They have secured continuity and coherence of Danish priorities: focus on consumers, enforcement, implementation of EU legislation and support of international work. The priorities have been modified where activities did not yield the expected results. The action plans have reflected ongoing policy discussions (e.g. on endocrine disruptors or circular economy) and Danish reliance on imported products (e.g. focus on users of chemicals and imported products). They have also highlighted consumers’ right to know and encouraged stakeholder involvement. The level of detail of the action plans has been enhanced over the review period. The Chemical Initiatives have served as a guide for Danish efforts in the European and global arenas and as vectors to promote Danish knowledge and expertise. They have been aligned with and supported policy developments at the EU level, e.g. the EU EAPs and the Conclusions of the Council of the European Union (Government of Denmark, 2005[31]; Government of Denmark, 2010[32]; Government of Denmark, 2013[33]; Government of Denmark et al., 2017[9]). The Chemical Initiatives respond to the interests of various 206  II.5. CHEMICALS MANAGEMENT OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 stakeholders. For instance, in line with industry expectations, the current plan prioritises respecting growth and innovation when substituting hazardous chemicals (Danish industry, 2017[34]). An area that might benefit from further improvement is chemicals’ role in Danish policy documents on occupational health and safety (OHS). The 2011-20 OHS strategy only marginally addresses chemicals. This is surprising, given the important interface of EU industrial chemicals and OHS legislation, as well as the significant involvement of Danish OHS authorities in chemicals management in Denmark (Government of Denmark et al., 2011[35]). The 2019 political negotiations in Denmark on the strategy beyond 2020 offer an opportunity to improve this situation. The first external evaluation of the Chemical Initiatives, in 2017, produced data that were not systematically gathered to evaluate the previous plans’ effectiveness. As EPA staff were directly involved in preparation of the evaluation methodology, it should be beneficial for future assessments. The results also gave a clear signal for policy makers that evaluation should be a standard procedure. Indicators to better track progress of the action plans should be further developed and their use improved. Pesticides The first pesticide action plan was introduced in 1986. All strategic documents of the last ten years in this area share the same overall objective: limiting the use of pesticides and (from 2013) minimising the pesticide load on the environment and health (Government of Denmark and the Danish Peoples’ Party, 2009[36]; ME, 2013[37]; MEF, 2017[38]). The pesticide strategy for 2013-155 initiated a significant change in pesticide management, introducing a pesticide load indicator (PLI) based on the impact of individual pesticides on human health, nature and groundwater. This replaced a treatment frequency index, whose reduction targets had not been achieved. In addition, a differentiated tax based on the environmental and health burden, with the rate higher for pesticides with higher load, replaced a pesticide levy based on percentage of retail price (Box 5.3). Box 5.3. Results of the 2013 pesticide load indicator reform are not yet fully known but appear promising Pesticide load calculated on sales data (but not consumption) allowed Denmark to meet its goal of a 40% PLI reduction in 2016. Since the reform, pesticides with a greater load have largely been replaced with ones with a lower load (e.g. in cases of certain insecticides or growth regulators), which made it possible to meet the target on the most problematic substances in 2016. Moreover, the reform coincided with reclassification of chemical substances and mixtures in line with the EU CLP Regulation. In many cases, this led to stricter classification in relation to health hazards and heavier health loads. The complete effects of the PLI reform on consumption were still not known in 2018, as farmers stockpiled pesticides ahead of the reform. The authorities need to monitor whether the reform negatively affects resistance to certain pesticides (e.g. antifungal resistance) due to, for instance, increased use of the least taxed pesticides. An action plan to address this, and to strengthen efforts to develop integrated pest management, will be implemented over 2019-22.

CHEMICALS MANAGEMENT  207 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 behaviour are expected in 2019. Further discussion on the tariff changes is expected to follow in 2020. Measures to compensate farmers and gain their support accompanied implementation of the reform. These included reducing the land value tax and using tax revenue to support organic farming and administrative services. Source: (Pedersen, 2016[39]; MEF, 2017[38]; Holtze, Kühl and Hyldebrandt-Larsen, 2018[40]; Denmark, 2018[2]; MEF, 2019[22]; Böcker and Finger, 2016[41]). The new tax has four components: basic tax, health tax (with rates differing by health hazard), environmental toxicity tax (with rates differing by species) and a tax covering persistence, bioaccumulation and leaching. The major goal of the strategy was reducing pesticide sales, based on PLI, by 40% to a level equivalent to a pesticide load of 1.96 (Figure 5.4). It also included a 40% reduction target for the health burden of the use of carcinogens and hormone disrupting substances (ME, 2013[37]). The pesticide strategy for 2017-21 has four main areas: pesticide authorisation; targeted and reinforced inspection efforts (focused on distributors); a pesticide research programme; and information, advice and guidance. The strategy serves as the National Action Plan for Sustainable Pesticide Use (MEF, 2017[38]). In January 2019, a supplement to the strategy was agreed. It contained additional measures regarding reduction of the risk of pesticidal contamination of groundwater in well vicinity protection zones, addressed pesticide resistance and banned (as of 2020) the sale of concentrated pesticides to non-authorised individuals. Additional measures and funding to strengthen monitoring of pesticides in groundwater were also agreed (MEF, 2019[22]). Figure 5.4.

CHEMICALS MANAGEMENT OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 In the last 13 years, the EU has substantially revised its legislation on industrial chemicals, in particular by adopting horizontal legislation, i.e. the REACH and CLP regulations. These rules have heavily influenced chemicals management in Denmark: on the one hand they imposed certain constraints (it was no longer possible to regulate some aspects of chemicals management at the national level), but on the other they provided new opportunities (e.g. making it possible to influence the EU-wide legal framework). There are also several EU regulations addressing more specific areas of chemicals management or groups of chemicals, such as those on cosmetics, detergents, and export and import of hazardous chemicals, POPs and mercury. In addition, EU directives addressing important areas of chemicals management include the Seveso Directive on major industrial accidents and the Industrial Emissions Directive. At the national level, key Danish legal instruments related to chemicals management are the Act on Chemicals, the Environmental Protection Act and the Act on the Working Environment. They are the basis for executive orders issued to, among other things, transpose the relevant EU directives into the Danish legal framework or address areas of chemicals management that are beyond or outside of the scope of EU regulations and directives. For instance, the Danish regulatory framework requires companies to provide information on substances not covered by the REACH Regulation, e.g. produced or imported in amounts between 100 kg and 1 tonne (Denmark, 2018[2]). Pesticides and biocides are covered by both EU legislation (the Biocidal Products and Plant Protection Products regulations) and national rules (EC[42]; ECHA[43]). In relation to prevention, preparedness and response to chemical accidents, Denmark expanded the scope of the applicable EU legislation to address smaller ammonia and chlorine installations as well. Denmark provides information on hazardous installations to other countries and exchanges information on accidents and near misses via the e-MARS database. Provision of information on hazardous installations to the public is also regulated, as is public participation in decision making (Denmark, 2018[2]). An ongoing process of removing administrative burdens in Denmark, exemplified by a focus on avoiding over-implementation of EU regulations, has had some impact on the regulatory framework. It led to a significant reduction of the scope of reporting under the Danish PRTR and green account programmes and the removal of certain taxes on chemicals (e.g. phthalates) (Denmark, 2018[2]). This process has not affected the ambitious and well-resourced multi-year national action plans on chemicals or the areas of chemicals management where the country is a standard setter. Institutional arrangements At the national level, the Ministry of Environment and Food (MEF) is responsible for environmental protection in general and oversees and co-ordinates chemicals management, covering industrial chemicals, pesticides and biocides. MEF has a unit on chemicals and a unit on industrial regulation (MEF[44]). The EPA is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the vast majority of chemical legislation. Participation in EU work on chemicals undertaken by the EU authorities has been enshrined in Danish policy documents since the enactment of the REACH, CLP and biocides regulations. It occurs at both the policy level (Council of the European Union) and the technical level, through ECHA and the European Commission (EC). MEF and EPA are the main participating authorities. For instance, EPA staff have worked on all of ECHA’s main bodies: the Member State Committee, the Committee for Risk Assessment, the Committee for Socio-economic Analysis, the Biocidal Products Committee and the II.5. CHEMICALS MANAGEMENT  209 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Enforcement Forum and Management Board (of which Denmark has been a deputy chair since 2017), as well as several ECHA working groups (Denmark, 2018[2]). Some chemicals management tasks are attributed to the Veterinary and Food Administration (VFA, monitoring food and feed for harmful chemical substances) and Agricultural Agency (AA, for fertilisers). Both are part of MEF. Important institutions not under MEF are the Working Environment Authority (WEA), which is part of the Ministry of Employment and is responsible for OHS; the Maritime Authority (MA); and customs. The Ministry of Health is involved on poisons and its research centres support the MEF/EPA work on chemicals. Finally, local authorities are responsible for certain tasks (Denmark, 2018[2]; EPA, 2015[45]). Those regarding chemical accidents are shared between the national Emergency Management Agency (EMA, under the Ministry of Defence), central and local environment authorities, and other authorities such as the police (Denmark, 2018[2]; EMA, 2017[46]). The national institutional framework was modified in 2015 by merging the ministries responsible for environment and food (actions related to food were included for the first time in the 2018-21 Chemical Initiatives). In addition, the EPA is being relocated from Copenhagen to Odense, with some former EPA staff integrated into MEF. As a majority of authorities responsible for chemicals are in the same ministry, co-ordination mainly takes the form of ad hoc intra-institutional consultations (or inter-institutional, for legislative procedures). Authorised access to registers and databases containing information on chemicals or installations (e.g. the Digital Environment Administration portal) supports information sharing among authorities. In some cases, the regulatory framework directly imposes co-operation among authorities (e.g. on major accidents or the REACH Regulation) (Denmark, 2018[2]; MEF, 2016[47]). Financing chemicals management, performance measurement and cost saving Denmark has multi-year action plans on chemicals (including biocides) and pesticides that guarantee stability of midterm funding. The Chemical Initiatives budget, for example, increased from some EUR 8.5 million for 2006-09 to some EUR 28 million for 2018-21. Between 2006 and 2017, this financing was highest in 2012-13 when activities under REACH peaked in relation to consumer products and information on chemicals. (Denmark, 2018[2]; Government of Denmark, 2005[31]; Government of Denmark et al., 2017[9]). Many chemicals management actions are undertaken and financed at the EU level, where Denmark contributes by transferring a percentage of its gross national income to the EU budget. For 2018, the EPA had a total budget of some EUR 24 million for chemicals management. The main sources of funding were, in descending order, the action plans on chemicals and pesticides (29% and 37%, respectively, or 66% in all), fees for biocides and pesticides (21%) and the general budget (Table 5.1). The budget for pesticides is slightly higher than for general chemicals management. The pesticide action plan also contributes resources to the AA and VFA, and the budgets of other Danish institutions help fund actions on chemicals management (Denmark, 2018[2]). 210  II.5.

Note: The budget does not reflect the fact that in the organisational change some resources were moved to MEF but still allocated to chemicals. Source: Country submission. In 2018, the EPA had over 120 employees in chemicals management. Slightly more staff were involved in pesticide work (38%) than in general chemicals management (32%); some 17% worked in biocides and the rest in enforcement. Employees of other national authorities working on chemicals, management, particular in OHS (over ten persons), increase the number. Some work is outsourced: for instance, the EPA and VFA have a co-operation agreement with Technical University of Denmark to provide scientific advice on toxicological assessments and scientific research on safety of chemicals for human health (Denmark, 2018[2]; EPA, 2015[45]). The human and financial resources secured by Denmark for chemicals management are encouraging. They support actions at the national level as well as in the international context, particularly within the EU. They also show that this area is a priority for the country. However, the EPA relocation process has triggered a visible turnover in staff, which entails risk in relation to institutional memory and current or planned activities when, for instance, new staff need to be hired and trained. For industrial chemicals, a cost-recovery mechanism is essentially enshrined at the EU level, under the REACH and CLP regulations, rather than at the national level. Companies’ fees, for registration of chemicals and application for authorisation, support covering the cost of services delivered by ECHA and national authorities. Part of the fee revenue is transferred to national authorities for work on substance evaluation, restriction proposals and authorisation applications (ECHA, 2017[48]). This cost-recovery mechanism may create challenges for the future, as it is likely to diminish after the last batch of REACH registrations in 2018. The EC stated in 2018 that implementing REACH required long-term financial and resource stability and greater national contributions in view of the diminishing fee income (EC, 2018[49]). As this could entail additional pressure on future Danish financial and human resources for chemicals management, it might be worth it to commence analyses on what form of enhanced contribution to ECHA’s work would be in line with Danish priorities. In relation to pesticides and biocides, it is the national authorities that charge the fees. Denmark charges annual fees on each authorised product (pesticides and biocides) and each place of sale (pesticides), as well as fees every three years for inspection of spraying equipment. These fees constitute a significant part of the Danish authorities’ budget (Denmark, 2018[2]). II.5. CHEMICALS MANAGEMENT  211 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 5.3.2. Compliance and enforcement need enhancement to meet Danish priorities on chemicals Unlike many areas of chemicals management, where efforts are shared between the EU and its members, Denmark regulates and performs all enforcement activities in relation to chemicals management at the national level, including implementation of EU legislation. However, common EU efforts on REACH and CLP compliance are increasing. While the approach to inspections concerning industrial chemicals is generally risk-based, it is more systematic in regard to pesticides and chemical accidents. The main Danish enforcement bodies are the Chemical Inspection Service (CIS, within the EPA), WEA and MA. CIS, with a staff of 17-18 persons, is responsible for industrial chemicals (including in electronics and toys), pesticides, biocides and cosmetics. The WEA is responsible for information obligations in the supply chain and for downstream users and OHS in general (including at offshore installations). The MA is responsible for chemicals related to obligations on ships. Some enforcement tasks related to chemicals management (e.g. on food) are attributed to other MEF agencies or other public authorities, particularly municipalities and customs (Box 5.4) (Denmark, 2018[2]; Dupont, Pelsy and Oulès, 2016[50]). Box 5.4. A project to protect children from harmful chemicals shows potential for further work sharing and co-operation As part of a broad initiative in 2013-16 to protect children from harmful chemicals, the EPA and customs conducted joint targeted border control actions. They built on an analysis of import volumes at various custom offices and used the relevant customs codes. The results suggested that, while certain chemicals (e.g. heavy metals) can be effectively controlled at borders, compliance checks for most products in the retail chain can be just as effective if not more so. The main reason is that border controls do not prevent products from entering the market, as they are released following sampling, yet further actions (e.g. chemical analysis) may be needed to determine product compliance. As the EPA plans to continue prioritising chemical import control and e-commerce, successful co-operation with customs (to be expanded to other stakeholders through the Danish Chemicals Forum) is expected. However, the above-mentioned results indicate more resources for enforcement in the supply chain may be needed to meet Danish objectives. Source: (Denmark, 2018[2]). Both informal and formal co-operation by enforcement authorities as well as joint inspections take place in Denmark. The enforcement authorities set their own inspection strategy. During the review period, some had a strategy that was not in line with the EU-wide strategy adopted by ECHA’s Enforcement Forum (EPA, 2015[45]), but that situation was recently resolved (Denmark, 2018[2]). The approach to inspections concerning industrial chemicals is risk based. In practice, this means complying companies can benefit from less frequent inspections, and enforcement focuses on certain geographical areas, particularly the capital region. Denmark makes its enforcement strategies publicly available. CIS focuses its activities on 15 to 18 targeted campaigns per year, plus response to complaints (some 400 per year). The WEA performs 212  II.5. CHEMICALS MANAGEMENT OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 general inspections in which all aspects of OHS are checked (Denmark, 2018[2]; EPA, 2015[45]). For pesticides, enforcement takes the form of systematic supervision of companies introducing products to the market. As there are fewer of them than of companies dealing with industrial chemicals, the effects of enforcement are more tangible. For instance, increased inspections in relation to sale of illegal pesticides led to a sharp decrease in infringements, from 30% in 2016 to 10% in 2017 (EPA, 2018[51]). Denmark participates in EU-wide enforcement activities, particularly regarding downstream users or consumers, in line with its approach to chemicals management. It also co-operates with other Nordic countries on inspections, with a focus on the EU legislation (EPA[52]; Kristiansen et al., 2018[53]). The country carries out systematic appraisal of measures applied by operators of Seveso installations.6 Almost all Danish upper tier installations have an external emergency plan prepared by the authorities (police and municipalities), which is above the EU average. However, testing of these plans has been an issue since 2003: it only took place for some 50% of installations due to an unclear division of responsibility. In 2018 the EPA published updated guidance material to aid authorities in addressing this issue (EC, 2017[54]; Amec Foster Wheeler, 2017[55]; EPA, 2018[56]). Denmark has a dual system of penalties for non-compliance with chemical legislation. Heavy fines (proportional to income and applicable to legal persons) or a criminal sanction can be applied, but in practice, the authorities focus on preventive and educational actions. The most common enforcement tool is a warning; legal proceedings are rarely initiated (Denmark, 2018[2]; Rass-Masson, Blainey and Pelsy, 2010[57]; Dupont, Pelsy and Oulès, 2016[50]). There are fewer inspections concerning industrial chemicals than in comparable EU countries (Dupont, Pelsy and Oulès, 2016[50]), which may be linked to potential differences in the scope of inspections and could become an issue in the long term. The results of recent enforcement campaigns related to chemical products (e.g. 80% of inspected hazardous mixtures sold online did not meet hazard information and labelling requirements) show that there is room for compliance improvement. Additional efforts may be required in the future, in particular to cope with a priority area for Denmark: chemicals in products. Moreover, coherent and mutually supportive activities of all countries implementing the REACH and CLP regulations may be necessary, so Denmark could benefit from increased involvement in EU-wide activities. Beyond the EU context, product supply chains are becoming increasingly global, so global action will be needed. Danish stakeholders support enhanced enforcement (Danish industry, 2017[34]). 5.3.3. Exemplary public participation and involvement in chemicals management Denmark actively involves stakeholders in chemicals management. Hence it is no surprise that Danes have the EU’s highest level of trust in national authorities (Eurostat, 2018[58]). They also top the EU rankings for understanding and use of safety information on chemicals (e.g. safety instructions, warning symbols, labels). They consider themselves well informed about the risk posed by chemicals and feel that chemical safety has improved in last 10 to 15 years (EC, 2011[59]; EC, 2013[60]; EC, 2014[61]; EC, 2017[62]). II.5. CHEMICALS MANAGEMENT  213 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 At the national level, Danish stakeholders can take part in the public consultation mechanism employed during legislative discussions. A Special Government Committee for the Environment, open to all organisations with an interest in environmental matters, is consulted on the Danish position in the EU and other international forums, and non government organisations (NGOs) are occasionally included in Danish delegations to international negotiation meetings (Denmark, 2018[2]). Improved, formalised dialogue with the industry has been an inherent part of the Chemical Initiatives. The creation of the Danish Chemicals Forum in 2014 strengthened stakeholder engagement in the chemicals area. The forum groups representatives from public authorities, industry, labour, NGOs and academia and focuses on dialogue, co-operation, knowledge and dissemination of information on chemicals management (Sørensen et al., 2017[63]). Stakeholder bodies are also in place for biocides (the Biocide Panel) and pesticides (the Pesticide Dialogue Forum). All meet a few times a year. MEF also meets regularly with stakeholders from the Danish cosmetic and toy sectors. Dedicated chemical events for stakeholders include Chemistry Day, organised annually since 2005; the 2018 edition focused on sustainable chemistry in the future (Denmark, 2018[2]). The public has access to non-confidential information on chemicals and has been the target of a vast number of initiatives, heavily supported by communication activities. The current Chemical Initiatives highlight the strategic importance of ensuring that consumers receive honest information about risks related to chemicals (whether in substances, products or food) so they can make informed choices. To increase awareness about hazardous chemicals and chemical exposure in the general population, and contribute to EU and OECD work, the EPA has undertaken information campaigns on chemicals in consumer products. Particular attention has been paid to vulnerable groups such as children. Another example is correct pesticide use. The EPA has published an exemplary amount of information on chemicals for consumers, including, since 2001, over 160 studies on everyday products such as toys, furniture, clothing and sport equipment. It has prepared educational material for school-age children. Since 2013, it has run a Facebook account called Hverdagskemi (Everyday Chemicals) to advise on safe use of chemicals (Denmark, 2018[2]). In September 2018, a website on chemicals in consumer products and food, bridging information from the EPA and VFA, was launched (EPA, 2018[64]). Stakeholders are often involved in these activities. Many other awareness-raising activities are directed towards supporting industry compliance with regulatory measures (EPA, 2015[45]). Thematic national and international workshops have been organised to promote knowledge sharing on chemicals of particular interest for Denmark, such as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) (OECD, 2010[65]; EPA[66]). Danish authorities support NGO work related to chemicals management and co-ordinate activities with them to build synergy (Government of Denmark et al., 2017[9]). For instance, the EPA and Danish Consumer Council launched a smartphone application to give consumers information on hazardous substances in products (Box 5.5) The same NGO launched THINK Chemicals, an initiative to test consumer products (e.g. earphones, diapers, cosmetics, chewing gum, cleansing tissues), in co-ordination with the EPA (Danish Consumer Council[67]). 214  II.5. CHEMICALS MANAGEMENT OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Box 5.5. Denmark is at the forefront of best practices stimulating public involvement in chemicals management In 2014, the EPA and Danish Consumer Council launched a mobile app called Tjek Kemien (Check Chemicals) enabling consumers to scan products for information on whether they contain substances of very high concern (SVHCs) under the REACH Regulation. It increased consumers’ awareness of their right to information on hazardous chemicals in everyday products. This experience and that of Germany, which launched a similar app, led to discussions on developing such an app at the EU level. It is being developed under the AskREACH project funded by the EU’s LIFE Programme, with Danish stakeholder participation). It is expected to be launched in 2019. Sources: (Sørensen et al., 2017[63]; ECHA, 2015[68]; Chemical Watch, 2017[69]; Chemical Watch, 2018[70]; LIFE AskREACH, 2018[71]). 5.3.3. Increasing the use of economic analysis in decision making Economic analysis in relation to decision making (including chemicals management) is built into the legislative framework at both the EU and national levels. At the national level, due to the growing importance of the horizontal EU legislation on chemicals, economic analysis has been increasingly used, particularly to influence EU-wide decisions and policies (e.g. in the work of ECHA technical committees). It was also influenced by studies showing the pressures from chemicals on Danish society. For instance, a high prevalence of male reproductive disorders, in comparison with neighbouring Finland, and a decline in the onset of puberty in girls have been observed in Denmark, with EDCs being identified as a potential factor (Krysiak-Baltyn et al., 2010[72]; Mouritsen et al., 2010[73]). It has been estimated that exposure to EDCs in Denmark leads to total yearly health and economic costs of more than EUR 2 billion (some 1.3% of GDP, which is above the EU average) (Trasande et al., 2016[74]). There are also statistically significant healthcare costs and productivity losses for adults with contact dermatitis. The socio-economic costs of contact allergies have been estimated at EUR 2.4 billion per year (Saetterstrøm, Olsen and Johansen, 2014[75]; Sørensen et al., 2017[63]) Denmark has begun evaluating the effects of its action plans on industrial chemicals. The 2017 ex post evaluation of the 2014-17 Chemical Initiatives, for example, assessed their qualitative and quantitative impact by identifying the overall goals and later establishing effect chains7 for each of the 14 actions. In effect chains, inputs, activities, outputs and effects are combined to explain how and why a given planned activity should lead to the desired effect. The analysis by external consultants and the EPA suggested, among other things, that the environmental and health benefits of the actions over the long term (50 years) would outweigh the costs in all scenarios, with benefits ranging from EUR 27 million to EUR 1.2 billion. An ex ante analysis of the 2018-21 Chemical Initiatives, mainly establishing the framework for a future ex post evaluation, followed in 2018. It recognised the use of the effect chains developed in principle for the ex ante evaluations (Denmark, 2018[2]; Sørensen et al., 2017[63]). Other public authorities in Denmark that have employed economic analysis in their work include the VFA, which in 2013 produced economic impact assessment tools for its staff to support cost-benefit analysis of its policy measures, and the EPA, which used economic II.5.

International forums and regional settings Denmark has long been at the forefront of global and regional discussions on chemicals management and has prioritised international co-operation in national strategic documents. 5.4.1. Multilateral environmental agreements and international organisations Denmark actively participates in the multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) and non-binding initiatives on chemicals, and contributes to international organisations’ work. It is a party to all relevant chemical MEAs (e.g. the Minamata Convention on mercury, the Rotterdam Convention on prior informed consent, the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants) and to regional agreements in the UNECE framework, including the Helsinki Convention on transboundary effects of industrial accidents and the Kiev PRTR protocol. Danish implementation is usually through laws transposing the applicable EU legislation (Denmark, 2018[2]). Among non-binding global initiatives on chemicals, Denmark has implemented the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling via the CLP and REACH regulation ( the latter in relation to safety data sheets). It is active in the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM), including involvement in and support for the SAICM Beyond 2020 process (EPA, 2018[76]). Denmark has provided both in-kind and financial support to the work of international organisations involved in chemicals management, particularly in areas aligned with its national priorities, such as EDCs. Over the review period, Denmark continued to be one of the top 15 contributors to the Environment Fund of UN Environment (Denmark, 2018[2]; UN Environment, 2018[77]; Urho et al., 2019[78]). Finally, Denmark contributes to the OECD work on chemicals: it chaired the Joint Meeting of the Chemicals Committee and Working Party on Chemicals, Pesticides and Biotechnology in 2015-17, and continues its participation in that body and its working parties and groups. 5.4.2. Regional and bilateral co-operation Although co-operation within the EU (see Sections 5.5 and 5.6 for Denmark’s contribution to chemicals management at the EU level) has become more important for Denmark, in line with the evolution of regional legislation on chemicals, it has not completely replaced other modes of regional involvement. They continue to exist, as do bilateral initiatives. Nordic co-operation Important regional co-operation on chemicals takes place within the Nordic Council of Ministers, an inter-governmental co-operation forum comprising Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, the Faroe Islands, Greenland and the Ǻland Islands (Norden[79]). The main vector for co-operation on chemicals is the Nordic Chemical Group, whose overarching goal is “sustainable development based on high-level health and environmental protection for both the present and future generations” (Norden[80]). For over 30 years, the group has co-ordinated members’ activities to support national efforts on chemicals management. Its 2019-24 priorities include supporting substitution of hazardous chemicals; strengthening EU regulations on grouping of hazardous substances; 216  II.5. CHEMICALS MANAGEMENT OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 co-operating on supervision of chemicals in articles, in recycling and in e-commerce; and paying special attention to the presence and impact of chemicals in northern regions and the Arctic (NCM, 2018[81]). Arctic region The Arctic Council is a co-operation forum comprising Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, the Russian Federation, Sweden and the United States, along with Arctic indigenous communities and other inhabitants. Of particular importance for chemicals management are its:  Arctic Contaminants Action Program  Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP)  Emergency Prevention, Preparedness and Response Working Group (AC[82]; Denmark, 2018[2]). Denmark is very active in the work concerning the region (for instance, in AMAP), particularly due to its ties with the Faroe Islands and Greenland (Box 5.6). Box 5.6. Continuing co-operation in the Arctic is important The Kingdom of Denmark consists of Denmark and the territories of the Faroe Islands and Greenland. The territories face serious environmental challenges. For instance, Denmark’s 2017 National Risk Profile identifies increased activity in the Arctic region as one of four challenges for the kingdom and calls for greater commitment to maintain effective civilian preparedness throughout the realm. A common policy document of Denmark and the territories, Strategy for the Arctic 2011-20, underlines the importance of monitoring the Arctic environment and protecting it from such hazardous substances as POPs and mercury. It also highlights focusing on national implementation of international environmental agreements and on prevention of accidents involving chemicals. Denmark and its territories co-operate on chemicals management, for instance through long-term monitoring of POPs and heavy metals in Greenland and related human health effects in Greenland and the Faroes. About half of Danish funding for research and monitoring in the Arctic is devoted to chemicals. The results support Danish activity at the EU level (e.g. under the REACH Regulation) and internationally (e.g. under the MEAs). Sources: (Prime Minister's Office[83]; Denmark, 2018[2]; Governments of Denmark, Greenland and the Faroe Islands, 2011[84]; EMA, 2017[6]). North-east Atlantic Ocean Denmark co-operates with 14 European countries and the EU within the OSPAR Commission under the OSPAR Convention.8 The goal of co-operation on chemicals is to prevent pollution by reducing discharges, emissions and losses of hazardous substances. The Hazardous Substances & Eutrophication Committee implements OSPAR’s Hazardous Substances Strategy, for instance via assessments of substances of concern for the maritime environment, regional data collection and co-ordinated monitoring. This work complements and supports the work of the EU and international organisations (OSPAR Hazardous Substances & Eutrophication Committee, 2018[85]). II.5. CHEMICALS MANAGEMENT  217 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Baltic Sea Denmark co-operates on chemicals in the Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission, HELCOM,9 whose aim is to protect the Baltic Sea marine environment from all pollution sources. On chemicals, the main goal is for the Baltic to be undisturbed by hazardous substances (HELCOM[86]). The work includes co-operation on environmental monitoring and reduction of inputs of hazardous substances to the Baltic Sea. Denmark led the project on risk of oil and hazardous substance spills in the Baltic Sea and is a lead country for developing the core indicators for “PAH and their metabolites” and “TBT and imposex” (HELCOM, 2015[87]; Denmark, 2018[2]). In 2018, Denmark signed a regional declaration whose commitments included jointly re-examining the effectiveness of measures and recommendations for legacy pollutants, identifying the scale of problems of contaminants of emerging concern, identifying and assessing further hazardous substances and contaminants from offshore sources, and developing appropriate mitigation measures (HELCOM, 2018[88]). Bilateral co-operation In 2014, EPA signed a bilateral agreement with the Swedish Chemicals Agency on co-operation in the EU context, e.g. on chemicals in consumer products and on EDCs. It aims to support information exchange and experience sharing (Denmark, 2018[2]). 5.5. Systematic investigation of chemicals Since 2007, the REACH Regulation has set the framework for systematic investigation of industrial chemicals at the national and European levels. Denmark actively contributes to priority setting and assessment processes at the EU level and to identification of chemicals of concern. 5.5.1. Gathering, exchanging and protecting information on chemicals Several chemical inventories at the EU level contain information provided by Danish companies. Examples include the database of substances registered under the REACH Regulation, the ECHA classification and labelling database (C&L Inventory), and databases on biocides and pesticides. Non-confidential information from these is publicly available, while the confidential part is accessible to authorised EU and national authorities (ECHA[89]). Denmark complements the EU inventories with its own databases. The Danish Product Registry, run jointly by the WEA and EPA, covers low-volume hazardous substances (of which between 100 kg and 1 000 kg is manufactured or imported per year) and mixtures (more than 100 kg produced or imported per year) placed on the market for professional use; biocides not yet covered by the authorisation system; and offshore chemicals. The registry contains information on about 38 000 registered products (WEA[90]). The Danish Nanoproduct Register (whose data are accessible only to the Danish authorities) gathers information on mixtures and articles containing nanomaterials (EPA[91]). Denmark also has a database of chemicals in consumer products (EPA[92]); a database of pesticides and biocides, including information on cancelled, rejected or expired authorisations (EPA[93]); and a database of advisory self-classifications (EPA[94]). Exchange and protection of chemical data Several mechanisms enable the exchange of various types of information on chemicals between Denmark, other countries and regional and international bodies. They serve 218  II.5. CHEMICALS MANAGEMENT OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 mainly to facilitate work at the EU level (e.g. confidential information is exchanged between ECHA, national authorities and industry) (Denmark, 2018[2]). In addition to EU data-sharing mechanisms, Denmark exchanges non-confidential information on chemical products with other Nordic countries and provides information to international bodies, for instance through reporting under MEAs, SAICM and AMAP (Denmark, 2018[2]). Confidentiality provisions are part of the national and EU legal framework. For instance, information in the Danish Product Registry is protected to ensure that companies can only gain access to their own confidential information (Denmark, 2018[2]). 5.5.2. Involvement in assessment of chemicals Priority setting and assessment Priority setting for industrial chemicals is in principle done at the EU level but in practice is a joint effort of the EU and national authorities. The Community rolling action plan (CoRAP) lists prioritised substances for evaluation. ECHA and the national authorities identify substances that could be included in CoRAP and subsequently evaluated by the national authorities (ECHA, 2018[95]; ECHA, 2018[96]). The EU legislation directly applicable to Denmark lays out a process for hazard, exposure and risk assessment of industrial chemicals, as well its timeline. Box 5.7 provides an example of the approach to chemical assessment in a non-EU OECD country: Australia. Box 5.7. Assessment of industrial chemicals: The Australian perspective Australia introduced the Inventory Multi-tiered Assessment and Prioritisation (IMAP) framework in 2012 to accelerate assessment of industrial chemicals and complement the work done in the Priority Existing Chemicals (PECs) process. This science- and risk-based framework is used to identify and rapidly assess existing chemicals of concern. It is also used to enhance risk management of industrial chemicals by increasing the flow of chemical safety information to industry, risk management bodies and the public. IMAP has extensively used assessments performed abroad, particularly in Canada, the United States and the EU. The number of industrial chemicals on the national inventory considered in the IMAP framework is significantly greater than the number considered in the PEC process: more than 12 000 chemicals were assessed between 2012 and 2018. The framework reduced the gap of unassessed chemicals from 92% to 61%. It has been used to identify environmental contaminants of emerging concern and has raised awareness of the need for risk reduction strategies for high concern chemicals. The accelerated rate of assessment of industrial chemicals achieved using the IMAP framework relies on a tiered approach in which chemicals are assessed at a level corresponding to their potential risk to human health or the environment. In 2016, the assessment focus shifted from identification of concerns (IMAP stage 1) to de-prioritisation (IMAP stage 2) (see Chapter 5 of the 2019 OECD Environmental Performance Review of Australia for further information). The human health and environmental assessments are often conducted separately, which allows resources to be efficiently allocated to addressing areas of concern. Under IMAP, chemicals are frequently assessed in groups, using OECD principles for building chemical categories, and a weight-of-evidence approach is used to consider relevant, reliable data from domestic and international sources. A comprehensive II.5. CHEMICALS MANAGEMENT  219 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship strategy, including custom-built tools, was established to support decision making. A significant investment was made in developing chemical informatics software that enables rapid assessment and maximises the use and reuse of the large amounts of quality-assured regulatory information generated in assessments. Once the Australian National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme reform enters into force, it is expected to replace both the PECs process and the IMAP framework with a new legislative tool. Source: (Australia, 2019[97]; OECD, 2019[98]). Denmark has actively contributed to priority setting and assessment processes at the EU level (Figure 5.5). Danish priorities for selecting chemicals are set in a multi-year action plan on chemicals and have been relatively stable over the last decade. The current Chemical Initiatives prioritise actions in relation to carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction (CMR) substances; chemicals affecting brain development; EDCs; allergenic chemicals; and chemicals of high concern to the environment (Government of Denmark et al., 2017[9]). Denmark has been especially active in estimating properties of chemicals from their molecular structure using results of SAR or QSAR modelling, known collectively as (Q)SARs. The National Food Institute at the Technical University of Denmark, supported by the EPA, NCM and ECHA, launched a publicly available (Q)SAR database with estimates from more than 200 (Q)SARs and (Q)SAR predictions for more than 600 000 chemical substances. It is part of the OECD QSAR Toolbox (NFI[99]). The country has been involved in investigating chemicals outside the EU framework, for instance under the Helsinki and OSPAR conventions. It has actively participated in development of the OECD test methods for EDCs (e.g. it led the development and adoption of a test for endocrine-disrupting effects in fish and updates on test methods for screening of reproductive effects and for developmental toxicity), and worked within the OECD to prepare guidance for authorities and industry on the use of the test methods for EDC assessment (EPA[66]). 220  II.5.

In principle, national authorities must authorise a product before it is placed on the market. There were about 650 authorised pesticides in Denmark in 2016 and some 350 authorised biocidal products in 2018 (Denmark, 2018[2]; ECHA[89]). Over 2008-17, Denmark evaluated 26 biocide active substances/product type combinations and 13 pesticide active substances (with co-responsibility for evaluation of further 14), with the final decision taken at the EU level. The validity of authorisation for an active substance in pesticides and biocides, and for a biocidal product, is typically no more than ten years. The validity of a pesticide product authorisation is linked to the active substance authorisation (ECHA, 2018[100]; Denmark, 2018[2]). 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 DEU FRA ITA BEL DNK SWE NLD ESP AUT POL Substance evaluation under the Community rolling action plan, CoRAP, 2012-21a a) The list includes substances that have been evaluated or will be evaluated by 2021 (March 2019).

CHEMICALS MANAGEMENT  221 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 For pesticides, Denmark is responsible for hazard, exposure and risk assessment of products, based on information provided by the applicant. The EPA accepts the use of assessments performed in other countries, with limitations (e.g. adoption of Danish requirements on leaching to groundwater). Denmark collaborates on assessments with other countries in a so-called northern zone,10 but the final decision is taken by national authorities (Northern zone, 2018[101]). For biocides, Danish authorities evaluate products under application for EU-wide authorisation and co-operate with other countries for product evaluation if an applicant seeks mutual recognition in multiple jurisdictions (ECHA, 2018[102]). Testing requirements For industrial chemicals, pesticides and biocides, the applicable EU legislation sets out testing requirements. The OECD Test Guidelines also apply. The EU legislation requires application of the OECD Principles of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP). Good Experimental Practice (GEP) applies for field trials on plant protection products. The Danish Accreditation Fund is responsible for GLP compliance and the EPA (with support from Aarhus University) for GEP compliance. For chemicals used offshore, the testing requirements follow the OSPAR Convention (Denmark, 2018[2]). 5.5.3. Contribution to identification of chemicals of concern Denmark has long worked actively on identification of chemicals of concern. In recent years, the tendency has been to focus actions on supporting EU-wide activities. As early as 1998, Denmark established a List of Undesirable Substances (LOUS). It was not legally binding, but guided the industry on what should be substituted. The latest version (2009) included 40 substances or groups of substances selected in line with EPA criteria (based on hazardous properties identified, for instance, by computer models). Over 2012-15, Denmark reviewed all the substances and groups of substances, in co-operation with stakeholders, with a budget of some EUR 6.4 million. The LOUS has not been updated, as its criteria largely overlap with those of the REACH SVHC. Selection of substances for the LOUS allowed Danish authorities to create a 2009 list of effects, including 19 500 substances that fulfilled the LOUS criteria but whose use had not been assessed in Denmark (EPA, 2010[103]). The selection of chemicals for both lists was supported by the Danish work on (Q)SARs, prioritised in all Danish action plans on chemicals. In line with national priorities, Denmark made significant efforts to identify potential EDCs and address combined effects of chemicals and nanomaterials (Box 5.8). Over 2013-15, the EPA carried out initiatives targeted at children, using the results as the basis for evaluation of total exposure of children (including those unborn) to more than 60 selected substances that were hormone disruptive, suspected of being hormone disruptive or posed neurotoxic and related risks (Larsen et al., 2017[104]). 222  II.5. CHEMICALS MANAGEMENT OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Box 5.8. Top priorities for Denmark: Endocrine disruptors and nanomaterials Denmark has assessed several potential EDCs and undertaken studies on the exposure of children to EDCs. It included potential EDCs on LOUS and ranked EDCs high on its environmental agenda during its 2010 presidency of the Nordic Council of Ministers and 2012 presidency of the Council of the European Union. In 2011, Denmark proposed EDC criteria for the REACH and plant protection product regulations and later pushed for their adoption. It also participated in the development of relevant OECD test methods and guidance documents. Denmark supported preparation of the 2018 UN Environment report on global EDC-related initiatives. Also in 2018, the government asked CEHOS to perform annual screenings of hazardous chemicals to support addressing EDCs at the EU level. In the context of EDCs, Denmark pushed for action to address phthalates at the national level (a holistic strategy adopted for 2013-15, a new set of compliance initiatives agreed in 2017) and the EU level. On nanomaterials, Denmark has undertaken projects aiming at investigating, and generating new knowledge on, the presence of nanomaterials in products on the Danish market and assessing possible associated risk to consumers and the environment. About 30 reports are available. Source: (Danish Chemicals Forum, 2015[105]; UN Environment/IPCP, 2017[106]; Denmark, 2018[2]; CEHOS, 2018[107]; Christensen et al., 2015[15]). Regarding industrial chemicals, Denmark has actively supported identification of potential SVHCs at the EU level. It has been among the most active countries in this area, submitting ten dossiers between 2010 and 2018 (ECHA[89]). On pesticides and biocides, the EPA Pesticide Research Programme, in place since 1987, generates information that supports the regulatory measures for these chemicals. The National Allergy Research Centre, established in 2001, played an important role in providing documentation on human exposure to allergens, relevant for the EU-wide restrictions on the use of chromium in leather goods (2015) and the prohibition of methylisothiazolinone in leave-on cosmetics (2017). The Working Environment Research Fund, established in 2003, aims to strengthen research and development in occupational safety and health (Denmark, 2018[2]). Pollution caused by pharmaceuticals is an emerging environmental problem. At the regional level, Denmark co-operates in the HELCOM collaboration platform on pharmaceuticals (EUSBSR, 2017[20]). Efforts at the national level have focused on pharmaceuticals in wastewater treatments plants, especially from hospital discharges (Denmark, 2018[2]). Identification and evaluation of chemicals of concern were high on the agenda in Denmark during the review period. Multi-year action plans provided stability of funding. However, additional effort may be needed to sustain Denmark’s standard-setting role in this area. The amount of work is rising (e.g. on analysing submitted data quality) and the transfer of fees from the EU level to support national activities started to diminish in 2016. The increasing amount of data (e.g. from research and implementation of legislation), combined with the increasing digitalisation of regulations and tools, will also require additional resources and capacity to better manage and use the information. II.5. CHEMICALS MANAGEMENT  223 OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 5.6. Risk management Denmark applies a broad mix of instruments to risk management of chemicals. Regulatory, voluntary and other tools are adopted at the EU or national level. Denmark supports substitution of hazardous substances. Danish environmental legislation incorporates the polluter-pays principle. The main legal instrument on chemicals, the Act on Chemicals, supplements this principle by making it possible for authorities to carry out chemical tests at industry’s expense if the latter does not do it upon request. The Environmental Protection Act requires industry to take precautions to avoid or minimise pollution and, failing that, to address its consequences. Certain fees collected by national and EU authorities help finance relevant measures by Denmark (EPA, 2017[108]; MEF, 2017[109]). 5.6.1. Use of risk management approaches Regarding industrial chemicals, risk reduction provisions correspond to the authorisation and restriction stages of the REACH Regulation and harmonised classification and labelling under the CLP Regulation. Denmark has actively contributed to the relevant EU processes where possible (Figure 5.6), although initiative is reserved for the Commission in some areas. The timeline for application of risk management measures is usually enshrined in the applicable EU legislation. However, if a risk is of a national character, national measures can be applied, with no set timelines (Denmark, 2018[2]). National regulations apply in areas not fully covered by EU or international legal frameworks. For instance, Denmark is one of the few countries with restrictions on the use of lead in gun ammunition (it applies a total ban, including outside wetlands) and fishing sinkers (ECHA, 2018[110]). The national restriction on importing or selling products containing lead is stricter than that of the EU (Fråne et al., 2018[111]). For plant protection products and biocides, risk mitigation measures are identified during the authorisation process. Denmark applies additional measures in certain areas (e.g. voluntary agreements on pesticide use in public areas, thresholds for use on golf courses, training for professional users and distributors). For biocides, specific authorisation is required to use rodenticides with anticoagulants or to fumigate for pests. Danish rules on evaluation and approval of biocidal insecticides include provisions to protect bees and other non-target insects (Denmark, 2018[2]; MEF, 2017[8]). Denmark has used taxes to reduce exposure to certain hazardous chemicals, but the PVC tax was recently abolished after a political agreement on easing the administrative burden on companies, and the phthalate tax was rescinded due to an agreement on an EU-wide restriction (Denmark, 2018[2]). 224  II.5.

Denmark actively contributes to risk management of chemicals at the EU level StatLink 2 http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888934002528 The area of occupational work and safety features national legislation and guidelines, combined with monitoring, research and stakeholder collaboration on safe work. It includes considerable flexibility in adopting national risk management measures related to CMR substances. In the last ten years, Denmark has adopted occupational guidelines for 17 substances, most of which had to be implemented within three to five years (Denmark, 2018[2]). The unintentional poisoning mortality rate dropped between 2006 and 2016 from 5.4 to 3.8 per 100 000 people (SD, 2018[112]). Poison centres support safe use of chemicals, as well as preventive and curative measures, by providing medical advice to the public and doctors on emergencies related to exposure to chemicals.

All support risk reduction by limiting the use of hazardous chemicals and promoting substitution by less hazardous alternatives. 5.6.2. Promoting substitution of hazardous chemicals Substitution of hazardous chemicals is enshrined in EU and Danish legislation and policy documents and in international agreements such as the OSPAR Convention (Denmark, 2018[2]). Danish OHS rules require replacing hazardous substances with less hazardous ones, even if the effects of the former are insignificant (Camboni, 2017[114]). The LOUS has long supported substitution by informing industry about substances whose use should be reduced or terminated. The 2014-17 Chemical Initiatives included a partnership between industry and academia to support substitution of certain chemicals of concern (Danish Chemicals Forum, 2015[105]; Denmark, 2018[2]; Kemi i Kredsløb, 2018[115]). A new innovation centre on substitution of hazardous chemicals follows up on that initiative under the 2018-21 Chemical Initiatives. An eco-innovation subsidy programme, under the 2015-18 MEF Environmental Technology Development and Demonstration Programme, supported research on substitution (MEF[116]). The Pesticide Research Program supports reduction of pesticide use (including biocides) and research on their negative effects on human health and the environment. Since 2016, the Chemical Initiatives have supported substitution with less harmful biocides (e.g. by subsidising their authorisation under a simplified procedure) (Denmark, 2018[2]). The Centre for Catalysis and Sustainable Chemistry at Technical University of Denmark is working on chemistry innovation and on improvement to known processes in areas such as renewable chemicals and sustainable production of chemicals (Centre for Catalysis and Sustainable Chemistry, 2017[117]). 226  II.5. CHEMICALS MANAGEMENT OECD ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS: DENMARK 2019 © OECD 2019 Recommendations on chemicals management Develop innovative tools to help decision making  Further expand risk-based monitoring of chemicals. For instance, enhance monitoring of legacy pesticides and their metabolites in groundwater and approved pesticides under the Pesticide Leaching Assessment Programme, and consider supplementing it with surface-water monitoring (relevant for biocides). Consider enhanced monitoring of emerging pollutants (e.g. pharmaceuticals in surface water and groundwater) and heavy metals (e.g. zinc in soil and water).  Strengthen biomonitoring to provide better evidence of people’s actual exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals and possible effects on human health to support policy making in this area; address trade-offs between monitoring and proactive identification of chemicals requiring regulatory action, taking into account the science-policy nexus (e.g. identification of exposure source).  Make assessment of the Chemical Initiatives’ effects a standard procedure and consider further development such as increasing the use of indicators to track implementation progress.  Make better use of PRTR data (e.g. for tracking trends in releases or benchmarking among companies). Implement and influence EU legislation  Continue identifying national priority areas for strengthened chemicals management and performing an active role at the EU level in identifying chemicals of concern (including the need for substitutes) and assessment of chemicals, including predictive risk assessment (e.g. in relation to endocrine-disrupting chemicals and quantitative structure-activity relationships) and risk management.  Assess implications of the coming reduction in REACH registration fees on activities that the fees are intended to support in Denmark.  Strengthen efforts at the national and international levels on compliance assurance for high-risk chemicals in products (including imports and e-commerce), for instance through enhanced co-operation with customs.  Assess the effectiveness of new measures to strengthen emergency response for the most hazardous facilities (covered by the EU Seveso III Directive).

The resulting knowledge led to qualitative and, where possible, quantitative analyses of effects (Sørensen et al., 2017[63]). 8 The Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic. The parties are Belgium, Denmark, the European Union, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom (OSPAR Commission[118]). 9 The Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea Area. The parties are Denmark, Estonia, the European Union, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russia and Sweden (HELCOM[119]). 10 The zone covers Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and Sweden (European Parliament and Council of the EU, 2012[120]).

While a longer data series is required for confirmation, the latest data points suggest a potential decoupling between waste generation and economic growth. • Denmark is considered to be on track to meet the 2035 landfill target, the 2025 municipal waste recycling target and the 2025 targets for packaging waste recycling for all materials, except for plastic packaging. • In the period 2011-2019, the recycling rate of municipal waste has slightly increased. In 2020, the change to the new reporting rules, which included the deduction of sorting residues, led to a reduction in the preparing for reuse and recycling rate. According to national waste statistics, 50% of municipal waste was recycled or prepared for reuse in 2022, and 46% according to data currently published by Eurostat. • The recycling rate for total packaging waste has fluctuated over the past decade, not least due to several methodological changes. In 2022, the recycling rate was 64.9%, thus very close to the 2025 target. The recycling of plastic and steel packaging needs improvement. • In order to further enhance recycling and reduce waste generation, Denmark could benefit from strengthening and/or introducing policy instruments for promoting waste prevention and making preparing for reuse and recycling more economically attractive, and diverting more waste away from incineration. Trends in waste generation and treatment Total waste generation The total amount of waste generated in Denmark increased until 2018 and has decreased since (Figure 1). This trend is primarily driven by the largest waste categories, namely soils and mineral waste from construction and demolition. When excluding mineral waste, recyclable wastes and mixed ordinary wastes dominate as the largest waste fractions. Denmark’s GDP increased throughout the considered period, with the exception of a reduction in 2020, most likely due to the Covid-19 outbreak. While a longer data series is required for confirmation, the latest data points suggest a potential decoupling between waste generation and economic growth. Country profile waste management – Denmark Page | 3 Figure 1 Generation of waste (total and excluding major mineral wastes), population and economic development, 2010-2022 Source: Eurostat (2024a, 2024b, 2024f) Note: Waste generation data for odd years are interpolated. Municipal waste Denmark’s municipal waste generation has decreased slightly over the past decade (Figure 2, left). According to data published by Eurostat, Denmark generated 802 kg/cap of municipal waste, which is significantly above the (estimated) EU-27 average of 513 kg/cap. However, according to the latest revised Danish waste statistics, this was 746 kg/cap in 2022 (Ministry of Environment of Denmark, 2024; Danish EPA, 2024). Figure 2 Municipal waste management (left) and rates of recycling (incl. preparing for reuse) and landfill (right), 2010-2022 Source: Eurostat (2024d) Note: No data are available for 2010. As of the reference year 2020, new reporting rules apply for calculating recycled municipal waste pursuant to the targets laid down in Article 11.2(c-e) of Directive 2008/98/EC. These new reporting rules have been implemented in Denmark from the reference year 2020 onwards. The data for 2020-2022 will be revised (Ministry of Environment of Denmark, 2024; Danish EPA, 2024). According to data published by Eurostat (Figure 2), the preparing for reuse and recycling rate was 46% in 2022. According to a recent revision of Danish waste statistics which still have to be submitted to Eurostat, the preparing for reuse and recycling rates were 44% in 2020, 48% in Country profile waste management – Denmark Page | 4 2021 and 50% in 2022 (Ministry of Environment of Denmark, 2024). Nearly half of the municipal waste is incinerated with energy recovery while only about 1-2% is landfilled. The data shown in Figure 2 differ from the provisional data reported by the Danish authorities to show compliance with the preparing for reuse and recycling target of 55% for 2025, as laid down in the Waste Framework Directive. Denmark reported a preparing for reuse and recycling rate in response to the target that was 5-10 percentage points below the data shown in Figure 2 for the reference year 2021, while the data reported for 2022 are very close to the data shown in Figure 2. The 2022 data according to this reporting obligation are provisional and are still awaiting validation by Eurostat (Eurostat, 2024c). In 2019, Denmark had 24 ordinary waste incineration plants, of which 17 are owned by municipalities. In 2020, the government decided to reduce the waste incineration capacity by approximately 30% by 2030, to correspond to the amount of residual waste in 2030 (EC, 2022). To adjust the capacity, the Danish legislation was changed in 2023 so that from 2025 onwards, municipalities have to tender the incineration of the collected waste foreseen for incineration, and the waste incineration plants will have to compete for receiving the waste (Ministry of Environment of Denmark, 2023). Environmental requirements for the incineration plants will be tightened so that plants that lag environmentally either invest in technological improvements or close. Packaging waste Denmark’s packaging waste generation has been increasing, from 125 kg/cap in 2010 to 187 kg/cap in 2022, very close to the (estimated) EU-27 average of 186 kg/cap in the same year (1) (Figure 3, left). Figure 3 Packaging waste generation (left) and recycling rates (right), 2010-2022 Source: Eurostat (2024e) Note: There is a break in time series flagged for 2020 for the recycling rates. As of the reference year 2020, the rules for calculating recycled packaging waste have changed, pursuant to Article 6a of Directive 94/62/EC. These new reporting rules have been (1) The EU-27 average might be influenced by the situation that not all Member States already fully apply the reporting rules for packaging waste as defined in the Commission Implementing Decision 2019/665. Country profile waste management – Denmark Page | 5 implemented in Denmark from the reference year 2020 onwards. (Ministry of Environment of Denmark, 2024) The recycling rate of total packaging waste has decreased slightly since 2010, reaching 65% in 2022, the same as the (estimated) EU-27 average in the same year, and nearly hitting the 2025 recycling target. The recycling rate is mainly driven by paper and cardboard packaging recycling, as it is the largest packaging waste fraction. The recycling rates for paper and cardboard and for plastic decreased significantly since 2019 (Figure 3, right). These decreases can be attributed to the change in methodology: before 2020, reporting of recycled amounts was based on collected quantities, but since the reference year 2020, collected but not recycled materials are deducted. The fluctuations in the recycling rate of wooden packaging are influenced by the supply and replacement of reused wooden pallets and recycling activities which may not take place in the same year as waste generation (ETC/CE, 2022). For the reference year 2020 and onwards, it is mandatory to report steel and aluminium packaging separately. In 2022, the recycling rates of both fractions exceeded the 2025 target. Policies in place to encourage waste prevention measures and to increase recycling Legislative framework and waste management plans Overall, the Danish waste legislation follows the EU waste legislation. The main acts and regulations regarding municipal waste and packaging waste include the Environmental Protection Act and the Statutory Order on Waste. Denmark’s National Plan for Prevention and Management of Waste (Ministry of Environment of Denmark, 2021) was adopted in 2021. This plan covers the entire territory and is supplemented by municipal waste management plans (WMP). (Ministry of Environment of Denmark, 2024) Waste prevention policies Denmark’s National Waste Prevention Programme (NWPP) is integrated into the National Plan for Prevention and Management of Waste 2020-2032 (EEA, 2023b), called the Circular Economy Action Plan, published in 2021 (Ministry of Environment of Denmark, 2021). Waste prevention measures and initiatives are incorporated and fully integrated into the programme, supplemented by a dedicated section (chapter 3) on waste prevention (EEA, 2023b). The budget foreseen for the implementation of the project is not specified. The Action Plan for Circular Economy includes qualitative objectives, indicators and initiatives spanning the entire value chain, from design and consumption to waste management. Examples of objectives related to waste prevention include (Ministry of Environment of Denmark, 2021): • less waste and less marine litter, • strengthening circular economy measures and better implementation of EU eco-design regulations, • making ecolabels mandatory in state procurement, • reducing limescale in drinking water to enhance the durability of electric appliances and to decrease the use of cleaning agents, • requiring the inclusion of total cost of ownership in state procurement, and • reducing the amount of food waste in all parts of the value chain. Country profile waste management – Denmark Page | 6 The priority waste/material streams covered by the Circular Economy Action Plan are biomass, construction waste, and plastics (EEA, 2023b). For biomass, the prevention focus is on food waste. With respect to construction, it aims for an efficient use of materials, with objectives such as promoting climate-friendly building materials and minimising material waste on construction sites. For plastics, the focus is on limiting unnecessary consumption. Examples of objectives are banning the marketing of specific single-use plastic products, a 50% reduction in selected plastic takeaway packaging, and research initiatives on circular plastic and textiles (Ministry of Environment of Denmark, 2021). The programme's effectiveness will be monitored annually and evaluated after six years. No information about the evaluation of the previous NWPP (‘Denmark Without Waste: Recycle More - Incinerate Less’, published in 2013 (EEA, 2023b)) is available in the Circular Economy Action Plan 2020-2032 (Ministry of Environment of Denmark, 2021). The Circular Economy Action Plan includes several indicators to address waste prevention. Examples of indicators are the material footprint (tonnes per capita), resource productivity (DKK per kg), climate footprint of public procurement (million tonnes of CO2-eq), and qualitative targets, including significantly reducing the amount of marine waste and reducing the amount of food waste in all parts of the food value chain. As an indicator for reducing the environmental impact of construction and demolition, Denmark monitors the proportion of constructions certified with the Nordic Swan Ecolabel, DGNB, LEED or BREEAM. (Ministry of Environment of Denmark, 2021) Based on the 2021 data submitted to the EEA in compliance with Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/19 (EEA, 2024), Denmark reused: • 5000 tonnes of textiles, • 27000 tonnes of electrical and electronic devices, and • 46000 tonnes of furniture. It should be noted that these data have been reported for the first time. As the reporting process matures, it is expected that these data will strengthen but for now, caution is advised in drawing insights from the dataset. More information about the interpretation and limitations of the dataset is available (EEA, 2024). Policies to encourage separate collection and recycling Denmark has a mandatory separate collection system for recyclables at household properties and companies. The collection is material-based and the collection systems do not distinguish between packaging and non-packaging waste. To improve the citizen’s understanding of the waste collection system, a harmonised pictogram and colour scheme has been streamlined nationally since July 2021 and is rolled out together with the national harmonisation of the separate collection system. Public entities and private companies are obliged to use the same pictograms and sorting criteria. This is used or underway to be used by nearly all Danish municipalities. (ETC/CE, 2022) The Statutory Order of Waste (Miljøministeriet, 2020) introduced this pictogram system together with mandatory sorting criteria for ten waste fractions (food, paper, cardboard, glass, metal, plastics, food- and drink cartons, textiles, hazardous waste and residual waste). Door-to-door collection has become mandatory for these ten waste fractions. Co-mingling is allowed Country profile waste management – Denmark Page | 7 for a set of specified combinations of waste materials. If door-to-door collection is not possible, collection points must be placed within ‘a short walking distance’. Co-mingled collection is allowed for certain combinations of waste streams (Ministry of Environment of Denmark, 2024). At the end of 2023, 80 out of 98 Danish municipalities had introduced the separate collection of all 10 waste fractions, and by 2025 full implementation is expected. The implementation status is regularly monitored and made publicly available (Miljøministeriet, 2024). Denmark has implemented a pay-as-you-throw scheme in some regions and municipalities (covering 50-80% of the population). (ETC/CE, 2022) Denmark has no Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme for packaging, however, it will be introduced in 2025 for all types of packaging materials (ETC/CE, 2022). The system will include advanced fee modulation, depending on the difficulty in recycling the packaging, and will use a fixed percentage malus and a variable percentage bonus based on the surplus from the malus. (Ministry of Environment of Denmark, 2024) Denmark applies packaging taxes with an escalator (taxes on packaging, bags and disposable tableware are indexed with 5.5% in 2024), covering beverage packaging (excl. for dairy), PVC films for food, bags and disposable tableware. Packaging that is included in the deposit-return scheme is exempted from the packaging taxes. Denmark implements mandatory deposit-return systems for aluminium drink cans, glass and plastic drink bottles, and a voluntary system for plastic crates. (ETC/CE, 2022) Policies and instruments to discourage landfilling or incineration Denmark has a ban on landfilling recyclable and combustible waste and applies a landfill tax of 475 DKK/tonne before VAT (64 EUR/tonne), which is considerably higher than the EU-27 average of EUR 39-46/tonne (EEA, 2023a). It has been constant since 1987. Since 1999, Denmark has applied a tax on the incineration of residual municipal waste of 52.5 DKK/GJ (7 EUR/GJ), consisting of a tax on heat generated from waste incineration of 20.7 DKK/GJ (3 EU/GJ), and an incineration tax of 31.8 DKK/GJ (4 EUR/GJ). Since 2010, a CO2-tax of 179.2 DKK/tonne of CO2 emitted (24 EUR/tonne) is levied on incinerated non-biodegradable waste. The tax on heat and the CO2-tax increase annually with the national net price index. (ETC/CE, 2022) Prospects for meeting the targets on recycling and landfilling After waste management stagnating for many years, Denmark managed to divert waste from incineration to recycling. In the EEA’s early warning assessment (ETC/CE, 2022), Denmark was considered to be on track to meet the 2025 targets for the preparing for reuse and recycling municipal waste of 55% and for packaging recycling of 65%, and the 2035 target to reduce landfilling to 10% of the generated municipal waste. Denmark has applied the new reporting rules for showing compliance with these targets since the reference year 2020. The recycling rate of municipal waste increased until 2019. When the new reporting rules were applied as of 2020, the recycling rate decreased due to the distraction of sorting residues, and progress might be masked by this change in methodology. Moreover, based on the data, the packaging recycling rate dropped to 64% in 2020 when the new reporting rules were implemented. The recycling rates of glass, aluminium, and wooden Country profile waste management – Denmark Page | 8 packaging surpassed the 2025 recycling targets in 2022, while they need to be increased for plastic and steel packaging. The Environmental Implementation Review (EIR) 2022 priority actions recommended introducing policy instruments for promoting waste prevention and making preparing for reuse and recycling more economically attractive, as well as shifting reusable and recyclable waste away from incineration with energy recovery (EC, 2022).

The More from Less report was followed by the 2019 EEA Report ‘ Resource \nefficiency and the circular economy in Europe 2019 – even more from less: An overview of the policies, \napproaches and targets of 32 European countries’ 2.\nIt presented an updated and extended assessment of approaches and identified trends, similarities and \nnew directions taken by countries in the connecte d policy areas of resource efficiency and the circular \neconomy. \nThese reports, comprising a compilation of extensive survey responses from countries, were accompanied \nby 32 country profiles. \nIn the second quarter of 2022 a new survey with questions and g uidelines was launched. Based on \ninformation reported by the Eionet network, in particular, the Eionet Group on Circular Economy and \nResource Use, and after review and editing by the European Topic Centre on Circular economy and \nresource use (ETC CE), the 30 2022 CE country profiles 3 were published alongside the EEA report ‘Circular \nEconomy policy innovation and good practice in Member States’ 4 (2022). \nThese 2024 CE country profiles are an update of the 2022 ones and based on the responses of 29 countrie s\nto the survey questions and guidelines that were launched in March 2024. The information in the \ncountries’ responses was again reviewed and edited by the European Topic Centre on Circular economy \nand resource use. A selection of Eurostat data was made to further complement these country profiles. \nThe main objectives of these assessments and its updates are to: • stimulate exchange of information and \nshare good practice examples among country experts; • support policymakers in Eionet countries, the \nEurope an institutions and international organisations by providing an updated catalogue of circular \neconomy actions being undertaken in European countries. \nThis circular economy country profile is based on information reported by the Eionet network and, in \npart icular, the Eionet Group members on Resource Efficiency and Circular Economy in the second quarter \nof 2024. Proposals for the further development or amendment of policies represent the view of the \nreporting country . For Denmark , all input was provided by the Danish Ministry of Environment. The \ninformation was reviewed and edited by the European Topic Centre on Circular economy and resource \nuse. A selection of Eurostat data was made to further complement this country profile.              \n\n1More from less —material resource efficiency in Europe —European Environment Agency (europa.eu)\n2Resource efficiency and the circular economy in Europe 2019 —European Environment Agency (europa.eu)\n3Country pr ofiles on Circular Economy in Europe —Eionet Portal (europa.eu)\n4draft -report -for -dg -env_final.pdf (europa.eu)\n\nETC -CE Report 2024/Denmark 3\nTh e information is current as of September 2024, when members of Eionet verified the content of this \nprofile.

The Action Plan describes the \nDanish targets, indicators, policies and initiatives along the entire circular value chain, from design through \nconsumption to waste from which natural resources are recycled i nto new products and materials. In \naddition to several initiatives along the value chain in general, the Action Plan focusses on three areas with \nsignificant environmental and climate impact: biomass, construction and plastics . The Action plan for \nCircular Economy contains 129 national initiatives – many of which are still under implementation. At the \ntime of data collection , 79 initiatives had been completed, 20 were on schedule, 29 were delayed, and 1 \nhad been cancelled. \nA n ew initiative that ha s been implemented is the m andatory door -to -door collection of household textile \nwaste in all Danish municipalities from 1July 2023. Denmark has chosen to introduce this ahead of the EU -\nrequirement for 2025, and with a door -to -door collection or similar col lection systems close to the \nhouseholds in order to maximize the impact on recycling .\nIn Denmark, many of the initiatives regarding circular economy and waste prevention are housed in other \nministries than the Ministry of Environment.  The Danish Governmen t's Action Plan for Circular Economy \nhas initiatives run by 7 different ministries.  This contributes to a broad collaboration of actors and sectors .\nThere is still room for improvement in terms of adapting the institutional set -up to mainstream circularity \nfurther across sectors and actors. \nA noteworthy successful approach includes the new environmental and climate -economic -CGE -model \n“Green Reform” th at has been developed by the Danish Government 5. The model will be used to assess \nthe environmental impact of economic activity as well as the economic effects of environmental , energy \nand climate policies. Underpinning the impact assessments in GreenRefo rm is an LCA -based model, which \nwill enable the projections on the circular economy under different policy and technology scenarios. The \nmodel is dependent on Green National Accounts (following the UN standard) and is anchored in the \nMinistry of Finance – in cooperation with the relevant ministries (such as Environment, Food, Climate and \nTransport). \nCircular Cities \nThe Region of Central Denmark has participated in the Circular Cities And Regions Initiative (CCRI) . In \naddition , many Danish municipalities are ambitious when it comes to circular economy. For example, the \nmunicipality of Copenhagen has set circular economy targets in their “Resource and Waste Plan” for \n2024 (6).   \n\n5https://fm.dk/nyheder/nyhedsarkiv/2020/oktober/danmark -i-spidsen -for -internationalt -samarbejde -om -\ngroenne -regnemodeller/ (in Danish )\n6https://www.kk.dk/politik/politikker -og -indsatser/klima -og -miljoe/cirkulaer -koebenhavn -ressource -og -affaldsplan\n(in Danish)\nThe draft -version of the 2030 -plan for Copenhagen is available at\nhttps://www.kk.dk/sites/default/files/agenda/4c2ace22 -b3ad -4eae -8a00 -7fea405ffd51/c9f94d92 -06ad -4320 -8c91 -\ne6022 246f487 -bilag -2_0.pdf (in Danish)\n\nETC -CE Report 2024/Denmark 9\nCircular economy policy elements included in other policies \nCircular economy policy element  Included in policy \nStreamlined pictogrammes , sorting criteria and \ncollection schemes for household waste , including: \n\n\nMandatory waste pictograms for collection bins. \n\n\nMandatory sorting criteria for ten fractions of \n\n\nhousehold waste. \n\nPublic and private companies are also obliged to use \n\nthe same pictograms and sorting criteria for their \nmunicipal waste. \n\nDoor -to -door collections have become mandatory for \n\nten waste fractions – food, paper, cardboard, glass, \nmetal, plastics, food and drink cartons, textiles, \nhazardous waste and residual waste. \nClimate Plan for a Green Waste Sector and C ircular \nEconomy  (in Danish) \n\n\n15 initiatives to support the reduction of food waste \n\n\nThe initiatives are divided in the following 4 tracks: \n\n\ninvolvement of actors and simplification of rules across \nthe food value chain; more knowledge on effective \nmeans of action; communication and access to tools; \ninternational engagement \nDenmark’s national food waste st rategy 2024 -2027  (in \nDanish) \nSummary of strat egy and launch  (in Danish) \nNew requirements (01/07/24 + 1 year transition period) \non selective demolition when demolishing buildings \nwith a size of 250 m2 or more.

Underpinning the impact \nassessments in GreenReform is an LCA based model, \nwhich will enable the projections on the circular \neconomy under different policy and technology \nscenarios. \nGreen national accounts  (modelling of environment -\neconomy linkages) ETC -CE Report 2024/Denmark 10 \nMonitoring and targets\nAssessment of circular economy performance \nThe European Commission has set up a  monitoring framework  to keep track of progress towards a circular \neconomy. This framework provides a holistic view as it:  \n\n•\n\nmeasures direct and indirect benefits of 'becoming circular' and  \n\n•\n\nvalues the contribution of a circular economy in living well within the limits of the planet  \n\n•\n\naddresses energy and material supply risks. \nIt consists of 5 thematic sections with a total of 11 statistical indicators , some of which have additional \nsub -indicators. In some cases policy targets exist which should be achieved in the future, and the indicators \nmonitor progress towards these targets. The current mon itoring framework is a revision of the original \nframework which was set up in 2018. \nThis section elaborates on the assessment of Denmark its progress in terms of observed trends over the \nlast 5 years and what country characteristics or policy actions ma y explain differences between the country \nits performance and the average EU performance .\nProduction and consumption :\n• Material footprint has increased at a higher rate in 2021 compared to a more steady increase in \nthe previous years. It continues to be ab ove the EU average. \n• Waste generation has remained relatively steady and decreased from 2018 -202 27.\nWaste management :\n• The recycling rate of municipal waste has been increasing steadily, however between 2019 -2022 \nthere have been some fluctuations.

As such, there are no \nnational quantitative targets. \nDenmark is still awaiting data that can showcase the effects of the newly harmonised waste management \nsystem on recycling, which has been gradually impleme nted from 2021 to 2023. \nFurthermore, Denmark’s status on reaching the EU -defined circular economy targets is currently being \ncalculated using the new EU recycling rate methodology where technical adjustments are still being made. \nInnovative approaches and good practices\nExamples of public policy initiatives (national, regional or local) \n➔ Good practice example: Green/Circular/Sustainable public procurement \nMandatory use of ecolabels and total cost of ownership in public procurement (9)\nIn 2022 it became mandatory to choose an eco -labelled product or a product that meets similar \nrequirements when procuring for the state for product groups where the government assesses that there \nis adequate competition and no significant price difference. Initially, it will be mandatory for the following \nproducts t o be eco -labelled or meet similar requirements: paper and printed matter, cleaning and cleaning \nagents, soap and some hygiene products, standard batteries and indoor painting. The list of product \ngroups with requirements for eco -labelled procurement will be updated once a year and expanded on an \nongoing basis. \nFurthermore, the government is making it mandatory to use total cost of ownership (TCO) as an economic \nprice parameter in connection with state procurement where possible and appropriate. In this wa y, the \nfocus will shift from the acquisition price to costs throughout a product's life cycle. The requirement will \ninitially apply to the 25 product groups where official tools are available to assess the total cost of \nownership. In addition, the governme nt is strengthening its efforts to develop TCO tools for even more \nprocurement areas and to make existing tools even more user -friendly. \nThe two initiatives are implemented through a Statutory Order on environmental and energy \nconsiderations in public pro curement, which is currently expected to enter into force ultimo 202 4.

This meant that private wa ste collectors and waste treatment operators should adapt to different \nlocal solutions, which created a fragmented market. This resulted in lack of economies of scale when waste \nwas treated, limited competition, sub -optimal solutions in waste collection an d in the communication with \ncitizens. \nSince July 2021 , pictograms, sorting criteria and collection schemes for household waste have been \nstreamlined nationally . The Statutory Order of Waste includes mandatory waste pictograms (for collection \nbins) and mandatory sorting criteria for ten fractions of household waste. Similar waste from public and \nprivate companies are obliged to use the same pictograms and sorting criteria. Door – to door collections \nhas become mandatory for 10 waste fractions (food, paper, cardboard, glass, metal, plastics, food - and \ndrinking cartons, textile, hazardous waste and residual waste). If door – to - door collection is not possible, \ncol lection points must be placed within ‘a short walking distance’. \nCo -mingling is only allowed in the following combinations: \n\n\npaper/cardboard \n\n\nmetal/glass \n\n\nmetal/plastics \n\n\nmetal/plastics/food - and drinking cartons \n\n\nplastics/food - and drinking cartons \n\n\nGreen national accounts (modelling of environmental and economic linkages (11 )\nThe Danish government has developed GreenReform, a new e nvironmental and climate -economic CGE -\nmodel (computable general equilibrium model) for the Danish economy. The modelling framew ork will \nsupplement existing macro -economic models with the aim of an integrated and consistent assessment of \nthe environmental and climate effects of economic policies, as well as the socioeconomic effects of \nenvironmental, energy and climate policies. Th e development of GreenREFORM is focused on developing \nsub -models, which among other things describe the energy, transportation, agriculture and waste \nmanagement sectors. \nOn top of these sub -models, a main model is being developed in the form of a CGE -model, which describes \nthe total economic activity in Denmark , and combines the results of the sub -models. GreenREFORM is \nbeing designed as a fully integrated model system , where all of the sub -models and the main model \ninteract and are solved simultan eously. Thereby, GreenREFORM shows the impact on e.g. waste \ngeneration and recycling, when implementing a specific economic policy or a policy in e.g. the \ntransportation sector. The model is depending on Green national accounts (following the UN standard) \nand is anchored in the Ministry of Finance – in cooperation with the relevant ministries (such as \nenvironment, food, climate and transport).    \n\n10 https://mst.dk/affald -jord/affald/affaldsfraktioner/de -ti -affaldsfraktioner/ (in Danish)\n11 https://dreamgroup.dk/economic -models/greenreform\nReport in English:\nhttps://dreamgroup.dk/Media/638493769228252341/Development_of_the_GreenREFORM_model.pdf\n\nETC -CE Report 2024/Denmark 14 \nThere is an ongoing EU -financed project with the Ministry of Finance in Austria, Finland and Italy, as well \nas nat ional agencies in Belgium and Poland, in order to develop environmental -economic CGE -models \ninspired by GreenReform 12 .\nThis innovative approach to modelling is being followed closely internationally (13 ).\nDecreasing threshold limit values for climate footprint from buildings (14 )\nWith the National Strategy for Sustainable Construction 15 , the Government introduces in the Building Code \na decreasing mandatory threshold limit value for climate footprint for new buildings .

One way to do so is to \nrecycle or reuse building materials, thereby maximising their lifespan and reusability. \nA prime example of this is The Circle House, which is expected to be completed north of the Danish city of \nAarhus in 2023. The Circ le house project, led by 3XN Architects, is devised to be a blueprint for circular \nconstruction in Denmark , with 90% of its building material able to be demounted and reused or resold \nwithout loss of value. \nAdditionally, besides using concrete and cement a s the main building material, the building project is set \nto minimize its CO2 footprint by using alternative materials, such as: \n• Cork and old newspapers, that are used for the façade of the buildings \n• Eelgrass and granules, which will provide insulation in the buildings \n• Used car tyres for the flooring’s underlay \nOnce completed, the Circular House will be the world’s first social housing project constructed according \nto circular principles. The hope is that the Circle House will create valuable learnings on h ow circular \nbuildings function in daily life, as well as provide a way of reducing carbon footprint within the construction \nsector. It is estimated that a circular approach to buildings will reduce CO2 emissions from materials used \nin the built environment by 38% by 2050. Furthermore, it is estimated that Denmark has the economic \npotential in implementing a circular economy in its building industry amounting to approximately € 7.75 \nbillion per annum up to 2035. \nRecycling of Wind Turbines (21 )\nThe turbines of the wind industry’s early days are reaching their end of life. Some are life extended while \nothers will be decommissioned during the next years. To combat this problem, the DecomBlades \ninnovation project has commit ted to try to find a sustainab le way to dispose the wind turbines with \nrespect to the environment, health and safety of workers. Today, significant progress has been made as \nthe project has succeeded in extracting and processing high -quality glass fibres , the principal wind blade \ncompo nent, from retired 37 -meter tall wind turbines. \nThe DecomBlades project is funded by Innovation Fund Denmark with MAKEEN Energy having developed \nthe large -scale pyrolysis test plant. Following the successful quality approval of glass fibres obtained from \ndecommissioned wind turbine blades, the material was subjected to remelting at 3B’s facility in Norway   \n\n20 https://stateofgreen.com/en/solutions/denmarks -first -circular -social -housing -project/\n21 https://stateofgreen.com/en/news/new -project -achieves -breakthrough -in -recycling -wind -turbine -blades/\n\nETC -CE Report 2024/Denmark 16 \nthis past September. In a collaborative effort alongside DTU Wind and Energy Systems, both 3B and DTU \nwill now examine and verify the properties of the generated glass fibres with remelted content. \nTh e way forward\nIdentifying and a ddressing barriers and challenges \nAccording to European Commission /JRC Denmark’s consumption footprint is not within planetary \nboundaries (22 ), a nd Denmark’s material footprint is much higher than the European average. This is mainly \nexplained by consumption of food, cars and buildings. \nThese challenges in high consumption of e.g. food, cars and buildings are best overcome by ambitious \npolicies a t a European level such as: \nImplementing the following: \n• Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR) ( proposed in March 2022 , e ntry into force \nJuly 2024 )\n• Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive ( proposed in November 2022 )\n• the Construction Product s Regulation ( proposed in March 2022) \nCompleting negotiations on: \n• The End -of -life Vehicles Directive ( Proposed in July 2023 )\n• Binding food waste reduction targets in the revised Waste Framework Directive ( proposed in July \n2023) \n• Green Claims Directive (Proposed in March 2023) \nNew EU legislation \n• Binding targets for consumption and material footprint (follow up on EAP8, article 3(s)) \n• Expanding waste hierarchy with focus on high quality recycling and differentiated waste \nprevention. \n• Binding rec ycling targets for construction and demolition waste in the revised Waste Framework \nDirective \nFuture policy plans \nDenmark’s national reform programme ( 23 ) from 2023 dedicates one of its chapters to “ Climate, \nEnvironment and Circular Economy ”.
