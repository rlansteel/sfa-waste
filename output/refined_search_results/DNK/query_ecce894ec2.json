Reference is also made to FORSK2025, which constitutes the basis and guideline for IFD’s implementation.\n\nThe Danish society and industries generally have a strong green profile and are leaders in many environmental technologies in the export market as well as the Danish market.\n\nPlastics handling and recycling is recognised as a global challenge. Denmark, however, is not yet at the forefront in this area.\n\nThe challenge and opportunities for green growth have been highlighted by a number of studies, including IFD’s analyses, in the government's action plan and by new EU regulations for recycling plastics, which come into force in 2030.\n\nObjective\n\nIFD wants to invest in prospective research and innovation projects that can help achieve the vision of a circular plastics economy benefitting Denmark and the environment.\n\nWith this call, \"Circular Plastics Economy\", IFD wants to strengthen Denmark's position as a future leading environmental technology nation in the field of plastics recycling and handling by, for example, creating solutions that provide sustainable value for companies and society and at the same time benefitting the environment, wildlife and nature, in addition to reducing the carbon footprint.\n\nInvestment Strategy\n\nIFD invests in projects at all stages of the research and innovation value chain and in interdisciplinary solutions, taking into consideration the entire product lifecycle and not only optimising single process steps or operations.\n\nAlso, IFD invests in both the good project that lacks the final steps to make it ready for successful introduction to the market or for implementation and in the early strategic research project where targeted efforts and cooperation with the most competent international and/or Danish partners from relevant professional disciplines are crucial.\n\nIFD's investments often do not take a project all the way through the value chain. Therefore, it is crucial that the project partners themselves have the ability to lift the result onto the market or ensure implementation - or have investors who can invest in or take over the project after IFD’s investment period.\n\nInvestment Areas\n\nInvestments are made in all the elements, whole as well as isolated, of the circular plastics economy,  with the clear perspective that ultimately, total solutions can be achieved that can function in practice and which can be self-supporting in the long term.\n\nExamples of relevant elements can be chemical technology, unit operations, sorting, transportation and handling, design, production, incentive and business models, consumer behaviour and legislation.\n\nBased on IFD’s report, \"The New Plastics Economy\" (see below), IFD has chosen to prioritise plastic from households as well as construction and industry.\n\nAssessment Criteria\n\nThe overall assessment criteria are:\n\nIn connection with applications for the Grand Solutions 2019 ”Circular Plastics Economy”, value creation is to be understood in broad terms as targeted activities that lead to increased growth and employment through e.g. development of new products and services, creation of more and more intelligent jobs, increased productivity, fewer societal costs, reduced resource consumption or environmental impact as well as to solutions to major societal problems.\n\nThe partners must account for the specific and preferably quantitative value creation of the project. Value creation should not be understood as just monetary value, but may also be e.g. increased quality of life, cleaner environment, etc. It is the applicant's responsibility to account for the different types of value creation.\n\nFrom IFD's side, great emphasis will be the potential of the project to create measurable value for Denmark and the Danish society. The project potential must be significant and result in new solutions or products, e.g. by development and use of new unconventional business models, methods, smart regulations, etc.\n\nSpecifically, the applications will be assessed based on the qualities of the project in terms of research and innovation in a global perspective in relation to an articulated or latent need, state-of-the-art, directly competing or closely related scientific or technological solutions, the scalability of the solution, technical, regulatory and market risks, the risk management of the project plan as well as feasibility. In addition, the development rate, the effective use of invested resources, managerial and professional skills and the subsequent effective implementation of the project results nationally and/or globally will be carefully assessed. The value creation of the project will be assessed in relation to the size of the investment.\n\nLikewise, it will be emphasised that the project's beneficiaries/end-users and core stakeholders contribute to the formation of the project, participate in the project or are otherwise directly involved in the project, e.g. through investments.\n\nIn addition to the above assessment criteria, reference is made to “Guidelines for Grand Solutions”. Allocation of funds will be made on the basis of the 2019 Finance Act.\n\nSelected projects are invited to interviews taking place in October 2019. Applications not invited for interviews and thereby rejected will be notified at the end of September. Final decision on the application is notified at the end of November 2019 with project start in Q1 2020.\n\nDownload the theme \"Circular Plastics Economy\" (PDF)\n\nScientific Officer Anitha K.

On this basis, applicants will either receive an invitation for phase 2 or a rejection.\n\nIn phase 2, the invited applicants submit a final application, describing their project in detail. When Innovation Fund Denmark has assessed all applications, the fund makes a decision as to which projects will be invited to enter negotiations for an investment agreement.\n\nThe application material for both phases must be created and submitted via the electronic application system: www.e-grant.dk. You must register as a user of the system with either a username and password or with NemID/MitID before you can create an application.\n\nYou create a new application by finding the correct call under \"Search Options\" and pressing \"Start your application\". Note that the list of search options is sorted alphabetically and that the names of all calls from Innovation Fund Denmark start with \"IF\".\n\nYou must write your application material for both phases in English.\n\nYou can find a guide to e-grant on the website of the Danish Ministry of Education and Research.\n\n\n\nIn both phases, the application consists of an electronic application form designed in the electronic application system e-grant (www.e-grant.dk), which you must fill out in English.\n\nYour application must have an official title (maximum 180 characters including spaces), which briefly describes the project for which you seek investment. You must also enter an acronym.\n\nApplication for phase 1\n\nIn phase 1, the application is a letter of interest and must contain:\n\nThe following optional appendices can be attached to the electronic form: Appendix A: Figure (max. 1 A4 page with max. 1 figure)\n\n\n\nApplication for phase 2\n\nIn phase 2, the application is a full application. The content of the electronic application form for phase 2 and the corresponding appendices will be announced in the invitation to applicants who make it to the next round. You can find more information on which adjustments are allowed from phase 1 to phase 2 in the programme guidelines\n\nYou can also see a preliminary outline of the application form for phase 2 below – please note that this is only a preview of the expected application form and that the final form may be subject to change.\n\nThe programme text for Grand Solutions has been updated in February 2024. To learn more about the changes to Grand Solutions, visit our Q&A here.\n\n\n\nThe applications are assessed by four committees with members who convene and qualify evaluations on committee meetings. The committees have the competence to assess as well as make decisions and are thus the bodies in which applications are evaluated and decisions on investments are made.\n\nThe committees consist of 10-18 members, divided between established international researchers and impact specialist with extensive knowledge of Danish affairs.\n\nIn phase 2, the applications are also assessed by external evaluators, and evaluations that are subject to consultation are sent to the applicants as part of a consultation process.\n\nApplicants who are not invited for phase 2 or to enter an investment agreement after phase 2 will receive a rejection stating why.\n\nSpecial conditions in 2024:\n\nIn 2024, letters of interest for phase 1 of the application process will be assessed internally and by external evaluators (including a consultation process for applicants) and decided by Innovation Fund Denmark’s board of directors. The reason is that the new committees are introduced for the first time in 2024 and will not be functional until later this year. Applications for phase 2 will be evaluated by the new committees in the second half of 2024.\n\nApplications for the Grand Solutions programme are evaluated based on three overall decision criteria:\n\nYou can find further information on the three overall criteria and their sub-criteria in the guidelines for phase 1 and phase 2 of Grand Solutions. Please note that the sub-criteria for the two phases are not identical.\n\nIn phase 1, applicants will receive either a rejection as response to their letter of interest or an invitation for phase 2, in which applicants must submit a full application. The decision will be notified to you via e-grant.\n\nIn phase 2, invited applicants will receive either a rejection or an offer of investment and thus an invitation to negotiate an investment agreement. The decision will be notified to you via e-grant.\n\nApplicants for phase 1 of Grand Solutions will receive a response in 7-8 weeks (11 weeks in 2024 however).\n\nApplicants who make it to phase 2 can expect 9 weeks of processing time in this phase and a total timeline of 9 months from submitting their letter of interest in phase 1 and until they receive a final decision in phase 2 (however, please expect up to 10 months in 2024).\n\nThe programme text for Grand Solutions has been updated in February 2024. To learn more about the changes to Grand Solutions, visit our Q&A here.\n\nAn investment from Innovation Fund Denmark is conditioned by the project parties entering into an investment agreement with the fund on the organisation of the project no later than 60 days after receiving the written invitation to investment negotiations.\n\nThe project must be started no later than 90 days after this investment agreement has been signed by all parties.\n\nInnovation Fund Denmark may demand repayment of parts of the investment if the agreed conditions are not met. You can find more information in the investment agreement and the document containing the general terms and conditions for the programme.\n\nBelow, you will find the standard documents needed for the investment agreement negotiations.\n\nYou are free to choose whether you want to prepare the agreement in Danish or English.\n\nThe project can start as soon as there is an approved investment agreement and it must start no later than 90 days after the agreement has been signed by all parties.\n\nThe payment is generally made two times a year and is handled in collaboration with Innovation Fund Denmark and the financial administrator appointed by the project.\n\nInnovation Fund Denmark is an active partner in all Grand Solutions projects and engages proactively with the project for its entire duration. Specifically, Innovation Fund Denmark appoints one or more investment officers to carry out this task.\n\nThe project follow-up and the requirements for accounts and reporting will be evident from the investment agreement that Innovation Fund Denmark enters into with each project.\n\nInnovation Fund Denmark may terminate the investment ahead of time if the Fund considers that there is insufficient progress, the project proves aimless, or if the project is unable to achieve the objectives which the  Funds' investment to the project is based upon.\n\nThere will be an ongoing dialogue between the appointed Investment Officer from the Innovation Fund as well as with the steering group of the project about the progression of the plan.\n\nAt the project's last steering group meeting, the completed accounts are reviewed and the project's progress and results are evaluated.\n\nSince publication in February 2024, the following clarifications have been made to the guidelines:\n\nHere you can find and download call texts\n\nSign up for the Fund's newsletter and get the lastest news about the Fund's investments.\n\nEuropaplads 2, 4. sal\n\n8000 Aarhus C\n\nkontakt@innofond.dk\n\nTlf. +45 61 90 50 00\n\nCVR: 29035695\n\nEAN: 5798000432864\n\n"

It builds to a large extent on the answers provided by the \nDanish Environmental Protection Agency in April 2021 to a questionnai re developed by the EEA and \nETC/WMGE . The EEA and ETC/ CE would like to thank the Danish authorities for the provided \ninformation and for the kind review of draft s of this assessment report in 2021 and April 2022 .1 Introduction \n1.1 Background and purpose\nThe Waste Framework Directive 2008/98/EC (as amended by Directive (EU) 2018/851) includes a \ntarget to recycle and prepare for reuse, by 2025, 55 % of municipal waste generated. The Packaging \nand Packaging Waste Directive (94/62/EC as amended by Directive (EU) 2018/852) includes targets \nfor the recycling of packaging waste, both in total and by material, to be achieved by 2025. The Landfill \nDirective (1999/31/EC as amended by Directive (EU) 2018/850) requires to limit the landfilling of \nmunicipal waste to 10 % o f the generated municipal waste by 2035. The Directives also foresee that \nthe European Commission, in cooperation with the European Environment Agency, publishes early \nwarning reports on the Member States’ progress towards the attainment of the targets, in cluding a \nlist of Member States at risk of not attaining the targets within the respective deadlines, three years \nahead of the target dates. This assessment is a contribution from the EEA to the early warning reports \naccording to Article 11b Waste Framewor k Directive and Art. 6b Packaging and Packaging Waste \ndirective. \nThis document is an early warning assessment for Denmark . The document is based on the analysis of \na number of factors affecting recycling performance (success and risk factors). The assessm ent aims \nat concluding whether Denmark is at risk of missing the targets for municipal waste and packaging \nwaste set in EU legislation for 2025. In addition, it provides a preliminary assessment of the prospects \nfor meeting the 2035 target for landfilling of municipal waste. \nThe assessment takes into account information that was available before 10 May 2022. \n1.2 Approach\nThe assessment follows a methodology developed by the EEA and ETC/WMGE and consulted with the \nEionet in 2020 (ETC/WMGE, 2021) , which was adjusted in 2021 taking into account experiences with \napplying the methodology in 2021 (ETC/CE & ETC/WMGE, 2022) . This methodo logy uses a set of \nquantitative and qualitative success and risk factors that have been identified to affect the recycling \nperformance . The assessment is to a large extent based on the information provided by the Member \nState in the reply to an EEA -ETC/WMG E questionnaire as well as on available data and information \nfrom Eurostat and other relevant sources. In addition, a consortium under contract with the European \nCommission (led by Ramb øll Group) has conducted a critical review of the draft assessment in \nQ4/2021 and provided further information. \nMore specifically, chapter 2.1 assesses the likelihood for Denmark to achieve the target to prepare for \nreuse and recycle at least 55 % of municipal solid waste (MSW) for 2025. Chapter 2.2 assesses the \nlikelihood for Denmark to achieve the overall packaging waste and specific packaging materials’ \nrecycling targets for 2025. Chapter 2.3 examines the prospects for Denmark to landfill less than 10 % \nof the generated municipal solid waste by 2035. The official early wa rning assessment for the \nlandfilling target is only due in 2032 and accordingly, the assessment contained in Chapter 2.3 is only \npreliminary. 1.3 Member State profile – context parameters \nMunicipal waste generation and treatment \nThe annual municipal waste generation and treatment has remain ed rather stable in Denmark \nbetween 2016 and 2020 . The municipal waste generation was around 5 million tonnes in 2020 . Waste \ngeneration per capita is very high, with 845 kg/cap in 2020, which is significan tly higher than the \n(estimated) EU average of 50 5 kg/cap in 20 20 . The country has a quite even division between waste \ncollected for recycling and waste incineration , being 53.9 % and 45.2 % respectively in 2020 . L ess than \n1 % is being landfilled. Waste col lected for m aterial recycling increased between 2016 and 2020 from \n29.9 % to 35.5 %, while composting and digestion stagnated around 18. 4 % . The recycling rate \n(collected for material recycling and composting and digestion ) has increased from 4 8.3 % in 201 6 to \n53.9 % in 20 20 (Eurostat, 2022a) .\nDenmark has a very high incineration capacity, roughly double the amount of residual municipal waste \nsent to incineration in 2019. On 16 June 2020, the Danish Government and Parties representing a \nbroad majority in the Danish Parliament agreed on a Climate plan for a green waste sector and a \ncircular economy . The climate plan i ncludes initiatives – amongst others – towards reducing waste and \nreducing the capacity for waste incineration. In order to adjust the capacity , a tender -based model is \nforeseen and the waste incineration plants will have to compete for the waste. Environmental \nrequirements for the incineration plants will be tightened so that plants that lag behind \nenvironmentally either invest in technological improvements or close. \nFigure 1.1 Municipal waste generation and treatment in Denmark between 2016 and 2020, in \nthousand tonnes \nNotes: Provisional data for 2020 \nSource : Eurostat (2022a) Legal Framework \nThe main national regulations in the area of waste are the Environmental Protection Act (Miljø - og \nFødevareministeriet, 2022) and the Statutory Order on Waste (Miljøministeriet, 2020b) , defining \nprinciples, responsibilities and requirements on waste prevention and management in Denmark . The \nStatutory Order on waste regulations, fees and actors (Klima -, Energi - og Forsyningsministeriet, 2020) \ncovers the treatment of waste that is not regulated by other legislation, the municipalities ’ regulations \non waste, schemes for waste, fees for waste, assignment of waste benchmarking of w aste incineration \nplants . In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency has issued guidelines for the sorting and \ncollection of municipal waste from households (Miljøministeriet, 2020c, 2020d) .\nWaste management plan(s) \nDenmark’s National Waste Management Plan (NWMP) Action plan for circular economy - National \nplan for prevention and management of waste 2020 -2032 (Handlingsplan for cirkulær økonomi -\nNational plan for forebyggelse og håndtering af affal d 2020 -2032) was adopted by the Danish Ministry \nof Environment (Miljøministeriet) in 202 1 (Miljøministeriet, 2021a) .\nThe plan was drawn up largely based on previous strategies, agreements, plans and revised ordinances \nand can thus be seen as a consolidation of these. It will be reviewed at the latest after six years from \nits adoption. The NWMP covers all types of waste g enerated in Denmark also including commercial \nwaste, sewage sludge, soil waste. The o nly exception is nuclear/radioactive waste. The NWMP covers \nthe entire territory and is supplemented by municipal WMPs. \nAccording to the NWMP sorting and collection of hou sehold waste must be streamlined for ten types \nof household waste (food, paper, cardboard, metal, glass, plastic, textile and hazardous waste as well \nas food and beverage cartons and residual waste). These waste streams must be collected from \nhouseholds a nd common national sorting criteria for household waste must be used to create a basis \nfor increased recycling with higher quality. \nThe N WMP states that the Danish government expects to mee t the 2025 and 2030 packaging waste \nrecycling targets by implementi ng all measures included in the plan , with the exception of plastic . To \nincrease plastic s recycling, Denmark is launching a number of initiatives such as the ban of the \nmarketing of certain disposable plastic products; a requirement to use 25 % recycled plastic in plastic \nbottles in 2025 and 30 % in 2030; a requirement of a minimum of 60 % real recycling of collected \nplastic waste from households by 2022 (Miljøministeriet, 2020b) .\nPackaging waste generation and tr eatment \nIn Denmark , 983 000 tonnes ( 169 kg/cap) of packaging waste were generated in 2019 , which is slightly \nbelow the EU average of 178 kg/cap. Packaging waste generation has been increasing , espe cially \nplastics packaging (Figure 1.2). Paper and cardboard packaging waste generation fluctuates at the \nlevel of approximately 67 kg/cap since 2010 (Eurostat, 2022b) .Figure 1.2 Packaging waste generation in Denmark between 20 10 and 201 9, in kg per capita \nNote : Data for 2010 are estimated values for all packaging waste, and in 2011 there is a break in \ntime series for metallic and glass packaging . Values for 2011 and 2012 are flagged as estimate s\nfor metallic and glass packaging. \nSource : Eurostat (2022b) \nCapture rate s for recyclables \nThe capture rate is a good performance indicator of the effectiveness of the separate collection \nsystem . The capture rate has been calculated for this report by dividing the separately collected \nweight of a certain municipal waste material by the estimated weight of the total amount of material \nin the municipal waste. The Danish EPA has provided calculations for the residual waste composition \nfor m unicipal waste . Due to an expected difference in composition for recycling stations and \nhouseholds/non -households residual waste, amounts of materials present in the residual waste from \nthese two sources were calculated separately. For Denmark the separat e collection capture rates are \npresented in Table 1.1 .Table 1.1 Capture rates for different waste fractions in Denmark                                                                                            \n\nResidual\nwaste\ncompo -\nsition\n(%) (a)\nResidual\nwaste\ncomposition\n(tonnes) (b)\nResidual\nwaste\ncomposition\nfor recycling\nstations\n(%) (c)\nResidual\nwaste\ncomposition\nfor recycling\nstations\n(tonnes) (d)\nSeparately\ncollected\namounts\n(tonnes)\n(e)\nMaterials in\ntotal MSW\n(tonnes)\nCapture\nrate s(%)\nMixed\nmunicipal\nwaste, total\n1858 138 136 709\nPaper and\ncardboard 18 343 220 18 25 252 555 614 924 086 60\nMetals 236 341 22674 166 562 205 577 81\nGlass 228 265 22080 148 420 178 765 83\nPlastic 10 193 298 10 14 222 75 331 282 851 27\nGarden waste 113 612 11367 948 750 963 730 98\nFood waste 44 820 921 11367 115 188 937 476 12\nTextiles 240 379 56835 1203 48 418 2\nWood n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a\n\nSource: Miljø ministeriet (2022) \nNote s: (a) Analysis of household residual waste and source -separated organic waste, 2018, the Danish \nEPA (Miljø - og Fødevareminis teriet, 2017) . The composition is calculated based on data from \nthe report. \n(b) The composition of household and non -household municipal residual waste is assumed to \nbe the same. The amount of mixed municipal waste is from Affaldsstatistik 2019 (Miljø - og \nFødevareministeriet, 2020), excl. the amount from recycling stations. \n(c) For residual waste from recycling stations, the same composition from household residual \nwaste was applied except for the share of food and textile waste. The composition is an \nestimate. \n(d) Provided by the Danish EPA \n(e) As reported in Affaldsstatistik 2019 , Miljø - og Fødevareministeriet (2020) \nThis indicates that there is some room for improvem ent to capture higher amounts of the generated \nfood waste, plastics and textiles and to some extent also of paper and cardboard .\nSince 2017 more municipalities ha ve increased the number of separately collected material which is \nexpected to affect the comp osition of municipal residual waste, especially for food waste \n(Miljøministeriet, 2022) . While a capture rate for WEEE can be calculated with the same method, it \ndelivers unreliable outcomes as there are considerable invisible flows (Miljøministeriet, 2021b) that \nare not captured in the data .2 Success and risk factors likely to influence \nfuture performance\n2.1 Target for preparing for reuse and recycling of m unicipal waste\nThis chapter aims at assessing the prospects of Denmark to achieve the 55 % preparing for reuse and \nrecycling target for municipal waste in 2025. For a detailed description of the methodology followed, \nthe development of success/risk factors and their impact on recycling, please consult the methodology \nreport (ETC/CE & ETC/WMGE, 2022) .\n2.1.1 Current situation and past trends \nSRF MSWR -1.1 : Distance to target \nThe overall recycling rate of Denmark shows a steady increase mainly driven by increasing material \nrecycling ( Figure 2.1). In this analysis the recycling rate is calculated by dividing the summed amounts \nof recycling of materials and of composting and digesti on by the total generated amounts. The data \nsource used is the Eurostat data set Municipal waste by waste management operations [env_wasmun] \n(following the OECD/Eurostat Joint Questionnaire); Data reported by Member States according to \nArticle 10.2(a) of t he Waste Framework Directive are not used for this assessment as the reporting \nmethods differ by Member State, resulting in a lack of comparability between Member States. The \ndata source used here is assumed to be the best available proxy , given that data in accordance with \nthe rules on the calculation of the attainment of the targets as defined in Article 11a are not yet \navailable. \nFigure 2.1 Recycling rate in Denmark between 201 6 and 20 20 , in percentage \nSource : Eurostat (2022a) The actual distance to the target for the most recent data point is a key factor determining the \nlikelihood of meeting/not meeting the target. The closer the M ember State is to the target already, \nthe more likely it becomes that the target will be met . For Denmark , the rate of municipal waste \ncollected for recycling is 53.9 % in 20 20 , which is close to the 55 % target for 2025 (Miljø - og \nFødevareministeriet, 2020) .\nHowever, the data used for this analysis is based on a different methodology than the calculation rules \nfor the target. The Danish government has provisionally estimat ed the impact of the application of \nthe new calculation rules on the recycling rates by accounting for average loss rates p er waste type. \nThe expected impact on the recycling rate for municipal waste is that the recycling rate would drop \nfrom 52 % to 44 % for 2019 (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 202 0). The same 8 percentage \npoint decrease is applied t o the latest available data (2020) in this assessment to calculate the actual \ndistance to the target. The Danish government is working on a more precise way of calculating the \nrecycling rate according to the new rules (Miljøministeriet, 2022) .\nSummary result                                     \n\nDistance to target 5-15\npercentage points\nBased on the currently available data, Denmark’s recycling rate was\n53.9 % in 2020, 1.1 percentage points below the 2025 target .Considering\nhowever, the application of the new calculation rules , an estimated\ndecrease of the recycling rate by 8percentage points is assumed , leading\nto an approx imate recycling rate of 4 5.9 %or 9.1 percentage points below\nthe target .\nRobustness of the underlying\ninformation\nThe new calculation rules are likely to lead to lower calculated recycling\nlevels. Based on calculations done by the Danish authorities , the recycling\nrate would drop by 8 percentage points .\n\nSRF MSWR -1.2: Past trend in municipal solid waste recycling rate \nThe recycling rate over the last five years shows a steady increase of 5.6 percentage point s from 2016 \nto 2020 , mainly driven by increasing material recycling (Figure 2.1). This indicates that efforts have to \nbe i ntensified compared to progress of the past few years. \nSummary res ult                           \n\nRR > 45%, and increase in\nlast 5 years < 10 percentage\npoints\nThe recycling rate has increased with 5.6 percentage points. For Denmark\nthe application of the new calculation rules would result in an estimated\nrecycling rate of 45.9 %, based on estimates done by the Danish\nEnvironmental Protection Agency that the recyclin g rate would decrease\nby 8 percentage points .The pace of improvemen t needs to be speeded up\nto obtain the target.\nRobustness of the underlying\ninformation\nThere are no break sin the time series data. For 2019 t he Danish\nEnvironmental Protection Agency estimated that the recycling rate would\ndrop by 8 percentage points i fthe new calculation rules w ould be applied ,\nthis same rate is used for 202 0in this assessment.\n\n2.1.2 Legal instruments \nSRF MSWR -2.1: Timely transposition of the revised Waste Framework Directive into national law \nTimely transposition of the Waste Framework Directive as amended by Directive 201 8/851, into \nnational law within the foreseen period is key for a waste management system in line with E U\nrequirements. Denmark has transposed the amended Waste Framework Directive in its Act No 807 of 9 June 2020 \nand Act No 645 of 19 May 2020 amending the Environmental Protection Act. Furthermore, the \nrequirements for separate collection and waste management are transposed in Order No 2159 of 9 \nDecember 202 0, which has since been repealed and replaced by Order No 2512 of 10 December 2021 .\nSummary result         \n\nTransposition without delay Denmark has transposed the amended WFD into national law by the\ntransposition deadline .\nRobustness of the underlying\ninformation\nCredible information received from the European Commission (status as\nof 12 November 2021 ).\n\nSRF MSWR -2.2 : Responsibilities for meeting the targets, and support and enforcement mechanisms, e.g. \ntools, fines etc. \nClearly defined responsibilities, enforcement and support mechanisms for meeting the targets across \ndifferent entities and governance levels are important for achieving high recycling rates. The clearer \nthe responsibilities for meeting the target s and the accountability for failing the targets are, the higher \nthe chance that the targets will be met. \nThe Ministry of Environment is responsible for preparing the n ational legislation related to waste \nmanagement, including set ting targets for preparation f or re -use, recycling, or material recovery of \nmunicipal waste , as well as stating minimum requirements for the management of waste. \nThe Danish Climate action plan for a green waste sector and a circular economy was adopted in June \n202 0, which agreed to streamline the collection of municipal waste, as well as changing the framework \nfor the waste sector so that it support s less waste incineration and more recycling. Further, it was \nagreed in the same Plan to reduce the incineration capacity . Capacity must be reduced and adapted \nto the Danish waste volumes so that the available capacity is not filled up with imported waste. In \norder to address plastic waste, t he Plan foresees setting up a system for collecting plastic wa ste in the \npublic space by January 2025 at the latest , as part of the extended producer responsibility for \npackaging to be introduced in Denmark .\nThe municipalities are responsible for collecting household waste and packaging waste as a part of \nhousehold waste and have to ensure proper municipal waste management. It is defined in the Danish \nlegislation , which types of waste the municipalities are obliged to collect separately and how the \nmunicipalities are to ensure p roper waste management. The municipalities have to define minimum \nrequirements for the collection of different waste fractions (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, \n2021; Miljø - og Fødevareministeriet, 2019; Miljøministeriet, 2020b) . The municipalities are required \nto separately collect ten different types of waste using high convenience collection systems (door -to -\ndoor or , for apartment blocks, in short walking distance ): food, paper, cardboard, metal, glass, plastic, \ntextile waste as well as beverage and food cartons, residual waste and hazardous waste. Th is \nrequirement is im plemented in national legislation and applies from 1 July 2021 . However, a majority \nof municipalities have been granted a n extension of the deadline until end of 2022 (Miljøministeriet, \n2021a) ; for textile waste the deadline still has to be decided but will lie between 1 July 2023 and 1 \nJanuary 2025. If the municipalities offer bulky waste schemes they are also required to sort the waste \nafter collection in order to achieve a high recycling and reuse rate .\nCommercial p roducer s of waste, including of municipal waste simi lar to household waste , are obliged \nto sort their waste at source into recyclable fractions, and to make sure that the recyclable fractions \nare used for material recovery (Miljøministeriet, 2020b) . Municipalities can decide to organise collection of residual waste from commercial waste producers or oblige them to deliver the waste to \ncertain waste facilities (Energi styrelsen, 2021) . Municipalities are obliged to control the correct \nmanagement of commercial waste via inspections (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021) .\nMeasures to achieve the targets are defined in the Circular Economy Action P lan – National plan for \nprevention and management of waste (Handlingsplan for cirkulær økonomi – National plan for \nforebyggelse og håndtering af affald 2020 -2032) . In addition, the municipalities are required by 1\nJanuary 2022 to set requirements for minimum 60 % recycling of the collected household plastic waste \nin their contracts with the waste coll ectors . The municipalities must furthermore ensure a high \nrecycling rate of all separately collected recyclable types of waste , however, national legislation does \nnot set quantitative targets for recycling for the municipalities to meet .\nThe Danish deposi t and return system (DRS) for beverage packaging is responsible for collection and \nrecycling of disposa ble beverage packaging , not for the handling of refillable bottles . The DRS is \nregulated in the Order  on Deposits  (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; Miljøministeriet, \n202 0a) .\nThe Danish EPA supports the implementation of proper waste management in Denmark via \ncommunication and cooperation with municipalities. The EPA has published guidelines for waste \nmanagement, aiming to streamline and improve waste collection and en sure increasing capture rates \nof recyclables in Denmark for both municipal waste and packaging waste (Danish Environme ntal \nProtection Agency, 2021) .\nRelated to enforcement mechanisms, the National Board of Appeal is the supervising authority for the \nmunicipalities, supervising the compliance with national law. In the case of non -compliance, the Board \ncan assign daily fines to the members of the municipal council as enforcement mechanism. (Danish \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, 2021) \nSummary result             \n\nClearly defined\nresponsibilities, enforcement\nand good set of support\nmechanisms for meeting the\nrecycling targets\nDenmark reports clearly defined responsibilities, as well as clearly defined\nenforcement mechanisms for meeting the targets on recycling of\nmunicipal waste , in addition Denmark also present ssupport mechanisms\nto improve the implementation of the responsible entities .\nRobustness of the underlying\ninformation\nCredible information received from the Danis hauthorities through the\nEEA -ETC/WMGE questionnaire\n\n2.1.3 Economic instruments \nSRF MSW -3.1 : Taxes and/or ban for landfilling residual - or biodegradable waste \nBans and t axes on landfilling of residual municipal waste can help to discourage strong reliance on \nresidual waste treatment and thus support recycling. \nDenmark has a l andfill tax in place since 1987 of 475 DKK/t ( about 63.3 EUR/t ) before VAT ( about 79 \nEUR/t VAT inc l.) . Since 1997 , there is also a landfill ban on recyclable and combustible waste (Danish \nEnvironment al Protection Agency, 2021; Skatteministeriet, 2020) .Summary result             \n\nBan in place for landfilling\nresidual or biodegradable\nwaste\nDenmark has a landfill ban , and a landfill tax of 79 EUR/t (corresponding to\n56 EUR/t rescaled based on purchasing power parities (a))\nRobustness of the underlying\ninformation\nCredible information received from the Danish authorities through the\nEEA -ETC/WMGE questionnaire .\n\n(a) Note : Rescaled based on purchasing power parities Eurostat (2020a) \nSRF MSWR -3.2: Taxes on municipal waste incineration \nTaxes on incineration of residual municipal waste can help to discourage strong reliance on residual \nwaste treatment and thus support recycling. \nDenmark has taxes on waste incineration via three different elements (Danish Environmental \nProtection Agency, 2021; SKAT (Danish Tax Authority), 2022; Miljøministeriet, 2022) :\n• An i ncineration tax since 1999 that totals 52.5 DKK/GJ in 2022, consisting of: \no A tax on heat generated from waste incineration ( 20.7 DKK/GJ) , which is indexed \nannually with the net price index \no An additional incineration tax (31.8 DKK/GJ) , which is not indexed. \n• A CO 2-tax since 2010 which is l evied on incinerated non -biodegradable waste (17 9.2 \nDKK/tonne of CO 2 emitted) , which is indexed annually with the net price index .\nDue to the different tax bases for the three taxation elements, the taxes cannot easily be translated \ninto a tax per tonne of waste. If an energy content of 10 .6 GJ/ tonne is assumed (Danish Ministry of \nthe Environment, 2013) , the incineration tax alone would be around 557 DKK/t onne , corresponding \nto 75 EUR/t .\nSummary result                  \n\nTaxes > 18 EUR/t (a)\nIf an energy content of 10.6 GJ/tonne is assumed, the incineration tax\nalone would be about 75 EUR/t (corresponding to 53 EUR/t rescaled\nbased on purchasing power parities) .Furthermore, a CO 2-tax is levied on\nincinerated non -biodegradable waste .\nRobustness of the underlying\ninformation\nThe underlying information provided by the Danish authorities can be\nconsidered robust. The calculation of the total incineration tax rate is\nbased on assumptions.\n\n(a) Note : Rescaled based on purchasing power parities Eurostat (2020a) \nSRF MSWR -3.3: Pay -as -you -throw (PAYT) system in place \nPAYT systems are designed to incentivize citizens to make a bigger effort in separating their waste at \nsource. However, a PAYT system should be designed with the appropriate level of source separation \nencouragement to ensure that citizens do not misplace waste in recycling bins in order to avoid \nresidual waste charges. Overall, PAYT usually has a positive effect on source separation and thus \nrecycling rates through direct involvement of citiz ens. \nDenmark has a policy of full cost recovery for municipal waste collection which allows for the \npossibility of PAYT -schemes. As a principle , the fees for municipal waste management shall cover all \ncosts related to the service . It is not allowed to cover cost for the service of coll ecting recyclables \nthrough the residual waste fee . The legal framework permits the use of PAYT by municipalities .\nMunicipalities still often charge a flat rate for collection of both recyclables and residual waste , wit hsome municipalities granting citizens a choice of the size of container, the larger container having a\nhigher fee (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; Klima -, Energi - og Forsyningsministeriet, \n2020) . Recent information about the shares of the different systems is not available. A survey of \nDanish municipalities performed in 2015 indicated that container volume based fees and fees based \non a combination of factors were dominant while there was very little use of weight based systems \n(Deloitte and Incentive, 2015) .\nSummary result               \n\nPAYT scheme implemented in\nsome regions/ municipalities\n(50 -80% of population\ncovered)\nDenmark has a policy for municipal waste collection which allows for the\npossibility of PAYT -schemes but m unicipalities often do not implement\nPAYT.\nRobustness of the underlying\ninformation\nIt is unclear how strong the economic incentive is for citizens to plac e\nwaste in the bins for recyclables instead of in the bin for residual waste.\nRecent i nformation about the shares of the different systems (volume\nbased, frequency of collection, weight based) is not available.\n\n2.1.4 Separate collection system \nSRF MSWR -4.1: Convenience and coverage of separate collection systems for the different household \nwaste fractions \nSeparate collection systems are a key enabler for high recycling rates and for collecting recyclables at \nadequate quality. Generally, the more convenient a nd accessible these systems are for their users, \nthe better results they deliver. The assessment methodology categorises different types of collection \nsystems (door -to -door, bring points with a density of > 5 per km 2, bring points with a density of < 5\nper km 2, civic amenity site) for assessing the degree of convenience, and differentiates between cities \n(densely populated), towns and suburbs (intermediate densely populated) and rural (thinly populated \nareas). It then calculates which share of the populatio n is served by which type of system. The \nassessment is done on a material basis and takes into account the different materials according to \ntheir average share in municipal waste. This is described in more detail in the methodology (ETC/CE & \nETC/WMGE, 2022) \nFor Denmark , according to the most recent data, the percentage of households living in cities is 32 %, \nin towns and suburbs 35 % and in rural areas 33 % (Eurostat, 2021a) .\nIn Denmark , there have been a large number of different waste sorting and collection schemes across \nthe municipalities , resultin g in a high variance in the collection schemes between municipalities. This \nchanged in July 2021 with the implementation of the Climate action plan for a green waste sector and \na circular econom y (see next section) , however, the majority of Danish municipalities have been \ngranted an extension of the deadline to fully implement the new requirements until end of 2022 . The \nuse of co -mingled collection has been increasing (Eurostat, 2020b) . The separate collection of food \nwaste is today not covered by all municipalities (56 %) (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, \n2021) .\nThe m unicipalities are required to separately collect ten different types of waste through high \nconvenience collection systems : food, paper, cardboard, metal, glass, plastic, textile waste as well as \nbeverage and food cartons, residual waste and hazardous waste . The collection should be door -to -\ndoor if possible, with respect to the types of buildings/housing area. Depending on the type of areas \na bring point can be used, that is located so it can be reached by foot. Thus, the type of schemes used will change ove r the next two years – since the deadline has been postpone d for a number of \nmunicipalities. \nBoth households and companies are obliged to sort their waste for separate collection. Municipalities \ncan decide if companies can use the collection system organi sed by the municipality or if they should \norganise collection themselves or through contractors. However, m unicipalities are responsible for \nthe inspection of commercial waste management (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; \nMiljøministeriet, 2020c) .\nTable 2.1 gives an overview of the collection system in Denmark . The collection in Demark is material \nbased and the collection systems do not distinguish between packaging and non -packaging waste . The \nDanish EPA publishes data about munic ipaliti es’ implementation of the requirements to collect ten \ndifferent fractions separately  (Miljøministeriet, 2021c) .\nTable 2.1 Characterisation of the collection system in Denmark                                                                                                                     \n\nCities\n(densely populated areas)\nTowns and suburbs\n(intermediate density areas)\nRural areas\n(thinly populated areas)\nDoor -to -door  -\nseparate\nDoor -to -door  -\nco -mingled\nBring point\n(>5 per km²)\nBring point\n(<5 per km²)\nCivic amenity\nsite\nDoor -to -door  -\nseparate\nDoor -to -door  -\nco -mingled\nBring point\n(>5 per km²)\nBring point\n(<5 per km²)\nCivic amenity\nsite\nDoor -to -door  -\nseparate\nDoor -to -door  -\nco -mingled\nBring point\nCivic amenity\nsite\nResidual waste xx xxx xxx x\nPaper and\nCardboard xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nFerrous metals xxxxxxxxxxx\nAluminium xxxxxxxxxxx\nGlass xxxxxxxXxxxxxx\nPlastic xxxxxxxxxxx\nBio -waste\nfood xxxxxx\ngarden xxxxxxxx\nTextiles x\n(few) xxxx\n(few) xxxx\n(few) xx\nWood xxxxxxxxx\nWEEE xxxxxxxx\nComposite\npackaging\nx( a)\n(few)\nx( a)\n(few)\nX( a)\n(few)\nOther:\nHazardous\nwaste\nx\nx\n(with\nWEEE)\nxxxx\nx\n(with\nWEEE)\nxxxx\nx\n(with\nWEEE)\nxx\n\nNote : xx: dominant system; x: other significant systems.

Many municipalities have introduced \ncollection schemes for bat tery waste and small \nelectronic waste, e .g. so that it is collected \ntogether with hazardous waste .\nRobustness of the underlying information \nCredible information received from the Danish \nauthorities through the EEA -ETC/WMGE \nquestionnaire. Danish municipalities apply \ndifferent types of separate collection systems for \nthe different materials. However, no \nquantitative information is available for the \ncoverage of each system. This means that the \npopulation coverages in this table are rough \nestimates. SRF MSWR -4.2: Firm plans to improve the convenience and coverage of separate collection for the \ndifferent household waste fractions \nIn the waste Law it is stated , that as of July 2021, with the option to apply for a derogation until 31 \nDecember 2022 , all municipalities are obliged to arrange high convenience separate collection \nschemes for the following waste fractions (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; \nMiljøministeriet, 2020b) : residual waste , paper , cardboard , metal , glass , plastic , food waste , textiles \n(between mid -2023 and 1 January 2025 ), composite packaging (food - and drink cartons) and \nhazardous waste .\nThe municipalities can choose between door -to -door -separate collection or door -to -door -co -mingled \ncollecti on (for certain combination s of materials ). For glass as well as for all fractions in densely \npopulated areas and from holiday cottages a bring point system in walking distance from the house is \naccepted. For t he following fractions co -mingled collection will be allowed (Danish Environmental \nProtection Agency, 2021; Miljøministeriet, 2020 d) : paper/cardboard , metal/plastic , plastic/ \ncomposite packaging , m etal/plastic/composite packaging and m etal/glass .\nToday, reusable textiles are collected via charity organisations. The separate collection scheme for \ntextile waste will be limited to t extiles waste not suitable for reuse (Danish Environmental Protection \nAgency, 2021) .\nTogether with the national harmonisation of the separate collection system, a harmonised pictogram \nand colo ur scheme is rolled out in order to improve the citizen’s understanding of the waste collection \nsystem across the country . It has been developed by t he Danish Environmental Protection Agency, the \nAssociation of municipalities and the Danish Waste Association and is used or underway to be used \nby nearly all Danish municipalities (Danish Waste Association, 2021) .\nAs of 2023 , non -household waste generators are oblig ed to sort their waste for separate collect ion \nsimilar to household waste for the same fractions as households with the same options regarding co -\nmingled fractions (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021; Miljøministeriet, 2020c) . It is \nimportant to note that non -household waste generators already are obliged to sort their waste and \nensure proper waste management . But from 2023 they are obliged to sort municipal waste in the \nsame way and use the same pictograms on the collection containers as municipalities shall for \ncollection containers for household waste.

The obligations for \nmunicipalities are set in the Danish legislation \nand explained in recommendations issued by \nthe Danish EPA. \n2.1.5 Extended producer responsibility (EPR) and similar schemes \nSRF MSWR -5.1: Fee modulation in EPR schemes for packaging \nWithin EPR schemes, fee modulation (or eco -modulation) is a system with different fees for different \ntypes of packaging material and designs. While basic fee modulation, i.e. different fees for the main \nmaterial groups, are common, advanced fee modulation can cre ate stronger incentives for packaging \nproducers to design for recycling and thus create favourable conditions for higher recycling rates. The \nlevel of advancement of the fee modulation is assessed against four criteria that have been selected \nas benchmarks for a well -designed eco -modulated fee system: \n• recyclability, for example differentiating between PET and PS, between different colours of \nPET, or between 100 % cardboard boxes and laminated beverage cartons; \n• sortability and disruptors, for example a malus for labels/caps/sleeves made of other \nmaterials, which are not fitted for the recycling technologies of the main packaging; \n• recycled content; and \n• if there is a transparent compliance check by the Producer Responsibilit y Organisation ( PRO )\nthat producers report correctly. \nDenmark has no general EPR scheme for packaging yet , instead Denmark has a comprehensive deposit \nreturn system for beverage packaging , also aiming at preventing free riding in relation to beverage packaging . The deposit return system is planned to continue and to operate in parallel with a new \ngeneral EPR scheme for all other packaging, which is not covered by the deposit return system. The \nimplementat ion process for setting up a general EPR scheme has started. A law that establish es the \nlegal bas is for a general EPR system for packaging in Denmark was passed by the Danish Government \nin June 2020. In March 2022, t he organisation and administrative setup for the EPR system is still \nunder discussion with political parties (Miljøministeriet, 2022) . The EPR scheme for packaging will be \nintroduced no later than 31 December 2024 and will include all types of packaging in all types of \nmaterials .\nWhile no EPR system and thus no fee modulation within EPR is currently in place for packaging, the \nDanish dep osit return system (Dansk Retursystem) requires producers and importers of bottled and \ncanned beverages to pay a quarterly fee for marketing beverages on which deposits are payable. The \nfees vary for each type of bottle or can , depending on the volume of t he bottle or can and their \nrecyclability . The fees are calculated each year based on the expenditure of Dansk Retursystem versus \nthe income. The fees are required to solely reflect the exact costs of operating and administering an \nefficient deposit and ret urn system (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021) .\nSummary result       \n\nNo EPR scheme and no\nadvanced fee modul ation Denmark has no EPR scheme for packaging yet.\nRobustness of the underlying\ninformation\nCredible information received from the Danish authorities through the\nEEA -ETC/WMGE questionnaire .\n\n2.1.6 Treatment capacity for bio -waste \nSRF MSWR -6.1: Capacity for the treatment of bio -waste \nBio -waste is the largest single waste material fraction in municipal waste, and adequate treatment \ncapacity needs to be made available .\nAs reported by the Danish authorities, the country’s separately collected bio -waste amounted to 1\n336 000 tonnes in 2019 , comprising of 353 000 tonnes of food waste collected from households, \nrestaurants, catering , retail and food industry , and 983 000 ton nes of garden waste . 93 % of garden \nwaste from households was collected for recycling (Miljø - og Fødevareministeriet, 2020) . In 201 9\n882 000 tonnes municipal waste was collecte d for composting and digestion (Eurostat, 2021b) . The \nDanish authorities estimate, based on current knowledge, that 75 % of garden waste collected for \nrecycling undergoes recycling treatment , if accounting for average loss rates per waste type according \nto the new calculation rule s. For food waste the estimate is 85 %. The Danish authorities do not report \na specific availa ble capacity for the treatment of bio -waste. The total generation of bio -waste within \ntotal municipal waste , including separately collected bio -waste and bio -waste present in the residual \nwaste fraction, is estimated at  1 901 206  tonnes in 201 7 (this is the sum of food waste and garden \nwaste ) (Table 1 .1 ).\nAs of July 2021 and by end of 2022 at the latest , all households should have collection of food waste ,\nand from 31 December 2023 the municipalities are required to establish a separate collection scheme \nfor garden waste from households . Bio -waste treatment will be privately organised and m unicipalities \nmust tender the treatment of bio -waste . Municipalities unable to cover the capacity demand from the \nprivate sector may be granted exemption from the legal requirement to tender the treatment of bio -\nwaste and allowed to arrange for treatment capacity themselves (Danish Environmental Protection \nAgency, 2021; Government of Denmark, 2020) .Based on a survey of treatment installations and a calculation on the potential of food waste in \nDenmark, the Waste and Resource Network Denmar k (DAKOFA, 2021) estimates that the current \ncapacity for anaerob ic digestion of food waste covers 72 -87 % of the food waste p otential (related to \nboth food waste from households and the service sector). \nBased on the presented information, it is likely that the currently available capacity for the treatment \nof bio -waste is slightly below 80 % of the generated bio -waste, however, the municipalities have a \nclear mandate to either tender or create the additio nal capacity needed to close any capacity gap. \nSummary result            \n\nBio -waste capacity below 80%\nof generated municipal bio -\nwaste but firm plans to close\nthe gap\nThe Danish authorities report that the required additional capacity\ndemand for the treatment of bio -waste will be covered by the private\nsector or the municipalities .\nRobustness of the underlying\ninformation\nThe information regarding available capacities is limited ,and information\nis lacking on how the future capacity building will be implemented in\npracti ce.\n\nSRF MSWR -6.2: Legally binding national standards and Quality Management System for \ncompost/digestate \nTo create a market for compost and digestate, compost should be of a good quality for use as a soil \nimprover or fertilizer. Legally binding standards provide guarantees regarding the quality of the \ncompost/digestate produced. A quality management system aims at addressing different elements of \na production pr ocess to ensure a stable and high -quality output (product) which helps toward \nreaching a defined quality for the product. \nDenmark has national standards for compost quality (EEA, 2020; Miljø - og Fødevareministeriet, 2018, \n2008) . Before the composting and/or biogas process, the bio -waste needs to comply with the limit \nvalues laid down in statutory order no. 1001 of the 27 June 2018 regarding the use of waste for \nagricultural purposes (Miljøministeriet, 2022) .\nThe Danish Agricultural Agency is in the process of implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1009 of the 5 \nJune 2019 regarding laying down rules on the mak ing available on the market of EU fertilising \nproducts . This regulation includes quality management systems and standards for compost quality \n(Miljøministeriet, 2022) .\nSummary result      \n\nLegally binding n ational\nstandards for\ncompost/digestate quality but\nno quality management\nsystem\nDenmark has legally binding national standards for compost quality . The\nbio -waste needs to comply with certain limit values before being used in\na composting and/or biogas process.\nRobustness of the underlying\ninformation The information is based on legal standards.\n\n2.2 Target for the recycling of p ackaging waste\nThis chapter aims at assessing the prospects of Denmark to achieve the 65 % recycling target for \npackaging waste in 2025  as well as the material specific packaging waste recycling targets (50 % of \nplastic; 25 % of wood; 70 % of ferrous metals; 50 % of aluminium; 70 % of glass; 75 % of paper and \ncardboard) . In order to conclude on this likelihood, the analysis takes stock of the status of several \nfactors that are proven to influence the levels of recycling in a country. For a detailed description of \nthe methodology followed, the development of success/risk factors and their impact on recycling, \nplease consult the methodology report (ETC/CE & ETC/WMGE, 2022) .\n2.2.1 Current situation and past trends \nSRF P -1.1 Distance to target \nThe actual distance to the target for the most recent data point is a key factor determining the \nlikelihood of meeting or not meeting the target. This analysis is based on data reported by Denmark \nto Eurostat in accordance with Commission Decision 2005/270 /EC as last amended by the Commission \nImplementing Decision 2019/665 (EC, 2019) , published in the da taset Recycling rates of packaging \nwaste for monitoring compliance with policy targets, by type of packaging [env_waspacr] . The latest \navailable data refers to 2019 . The performance of Denmark for 2019 is illustrated in Figure 2.2.\nFigure 2.2 Packaging recycling rates for Denmark in 201 9, in percentage \nNote : No data available for ferrous and aluminium packaging, only for metallic packaging .\nSource : Eurostat (2022c) , EU (2018) \nFor Denmark the reported recycling rates exceed the targets for all packaging materials except of \nplastic s packaging . For total packaging, the recycling exceeds the target by 5.4 percentage poin ts, f or \npaper and cardboard packaging by 22. 7 percentage point s, for glass by 1.1 percentage points , and for \nwooden packaging by 32.4 percentage points. For metals, the reported rates do not make a distinction \nbetween ferrous metals and aluminium, but the total recycling rate for metals ( 61.3 %) still exceeds the rec ycling target for aluminium , but not for ferrous metals . For plastic s packaging, the reported \nrecycling rate is 12.6 percentage points below the target (Eurostat, 2022c) .\nHowever, the recycling rates presented are based on the calculation rules of the Commission Decision \n2005/270 before it was amended by the Commission Implementing Decision 2019/665 and will likely \ndiffer from the recycling rates to be reported according to the new calculation rules . The new \ncalculation rules will only be mandatory to be used for the reference year 2020 and onwards. A key \ndifference in the new calculation rules compared to the old rules is that the amount of sorted \npackaging waste that is rejected by the recycling faci lity shall not be included in the reported amount \nof recycled packaging waste. \nDenmark has carried out a preliminary assessment of the impact of the new calculation rules. \nCurrently, the reported data refer to packaging waste collected for recycling and the final recycling \nrate will refer to the output of recycling. The Danish government has estimat ed final recycling rates \nfor the year 2018 by accounting for average loss rates per waste type (Danish Environmental \nProtection Agency, 2021) . If the same reduction in the rates (in percentage points) are used to \ncalculate the impact of the new calculation rules to the repo rted data for the year 2019, the recycling \nrates would decrease as follows :\n• Paper and cardboard packaging waste by 3 per cent points from 99.7 % to 96.7 %\n• Metal packaging waste by 10 per cent points from 61.3 % to 51.3 %\n• Glass packaging waste by 3 per cent points from 71.1 % to 68.1 %\n• Plastic packaging waste by 17 per cent points from 37.4 % to 20.4 %\n• Wood packaging waste by 4 per cent points from 57.4 % to 53.4 %\n• Total packaging: Calculated based on the amounts of each p ackaging material generated and \nrecycled in 201 9, the recycling rate would drop from 70.4 % to 64.1 %. \nThe waste generation data includes also privately imported packaging , and for plastics and \npaper/cardboard also estimates for online sales (Eurostat, 2020b) .\nIt is likely that the currently reported recycling rate of 99.7 % is overestimated for paper and cardboard \npackaging. The latest Danish composition analysis of mixed household waste (Miljøstyrelsen, 2018) \nfound that 3.1 % of this waste was cardboard, corresponding to around 3 1 000 tonnes in 2017 (the \nsame study reports the amount of mixed household waste to be 995 000 tonnes). If it is assumed that \nmost of this cardboard is packaging, around 8 % of the generated paper and cardboard packaging \nwould end up in mixed municipal waste. This  estimate  does not take into account municipal waste \nfrom non -households and paper packaging. \nSummary result                         \n\nTotal\npackaging < 5 percentage points below targe t\nDenmark reports a recycling rate of 70.4 %.If the\nestimated loss rate provided by Denmark is\napplied (taking into account losses in the\nrecycling plants), the estimated recycling rate\nwould drop to 64.1 %, 0.9 percentage points\nbelow the 2025 target.\nPaper and\ncardboard\npackaging\nTarget exceeded\nDenmark reports a recycling rate of 99.7 %.

If the \nestimated loss rate provided by Denmark is \napplied (taking into account losses in the \nrecycling plants), the estimated recycling rate \nwould drop to 53.4 %, 28.4 percentage points \nabove the 2025 target. \nRobustness of the underlying information \nThe recycling rates used for the assessment \nreferring to 2019 data are estimated, by applying \nthe same reduction (in percentage points) as \ncalculated by the Danish authorities for losses \nduring sorting and recycling for the 2018 data in \norder to assess th e impact of the new calculation \nrules on the currently reported recycling rates. \nSeparate data for aluminium and ferrous metals \npackaging are not yet available. \nThe 99.7 % recycling rate for paper and \ncardboard packaging is very high, indicating that \nnot all generated paper and cardboard waste \nmay be included in the waste generation data. \nDanish authorities indicate that the methodology \nfor the data on amounts put on the market \nunderestimates the amounts for paper and \ncardboard and overestimates the amount s for \nplastics packaging. \nSRF P -1.2 : Past trend in Packaging Waste Recycling \nThe development of the historical trend in the recycling rate indicates previous efforts towards \npackaging waste recycling. In this analysis the recycling rate reported in the E urostat dataset Recycling \nrates of packaging waste for monitoring compliance with policy targets, by type of packaging \n[env_waspacr] (latest data year: 2019) is used. The recycling trends for packaging waste by material \nin Denmark are illustrated in Figure 2.3.Figure 2.3 Trend in packaging waste recycling rates in Denmark between 201 5 and 201 9, in \npercentage \nSource : Eurostat (2022c) \nThe overall packaging recycling rate for the past five years started at 73.9 % in 201 5, peak ed at 79 %\nin 2016 and dropped to 70.4 % in 201 9. The recycling rate of paper and cardboard packaging increased \nfrom 95.3 % in 201 5 to 99.7 % in 2019 .

Packaging waste is under the same administration as \nmunicipal waste . However, t he implementation process for setting up a general EPR scheme has \nstarted (see Section 2.1.5) , with the aim to transfer the responsibility for packaging recycl ing to the \nproducers . The EPR scheme for packaging will be introduced no later than 31 December 2024 and will \ninclude all types of packaging in all types of materials. Decisions about the organisation and \nadministrative setup for the EPR system have not yet been made and thus fort hcoming responsibilities \nfor meeting the packaging waste targets in Denmark are not fully defined .Summary result \nUnclear responsibilities, \nweak/no enforcement \nmechanisms and lack of \nsupport tools for meeting the \nrecycling targets \nDenmark has planned to implement an EPR scheme for packaging waste \nby the end of 2024, but the configuration of the scheme , enforcement and \nsupport mechanisms are not yet defined .\nRobustness of the underlying \ninformation \nReliable information provided by the Danish authorities in the EEA -\nETC/WM GE questionnaire.

Such systems generally deliver better results the more convenient \nand accessible they are for their users, also compared to the collection of residual waste. The material \nspecific assessment considers packaging was te from both household and non -household sources. For \nassessing the convenience and coverage of separate collection systems for households, the same \nmethodology is used here as described in s ection 2.1.4 .\nAs described in Section  2.1.4  in more detail, s eparate collection is mandatory in Denmark for both \nhouseholds and companies (non -households) .\nSummary result \nPaper a nd \ncardboard \npackaging \n\nPackaging waste from households \n\nA high share of the population is covered by \nhigh convenience collection services \nDanish municipalities apply different separate \ncollection schemes for the collection of paper \nand cardboard waste , but door -to -door \nseparate collection and high -density bring \npoints dominate. \n\nPackaging waste from non -household \n\nsources \nSeparation at source is mandatory for non -\nhousehold p aper and cardboard packaging \nwaste \nSeparat ion at source is mandatory in Denmark \nfor companies \nFerrous \nmetals \npackaging \n\nPackaging waste from households \n\nA high share of population is covered by high \nconvenience collection services \nDenmark applies all separate collection \nalternatives for the collection of metals, \nexcept low -density bring points in urban areas \nand civic amenity sites in rural areas. \n\nPackaging waste from non -household \n\nsources \nSeparation at source is mandatory for non -\nhousehold ferrous metals packaging waste \nSeparat ion at source is mandatory in Denmark \nfor companies Aluminium \npackaging \nPackaging waste from households \nA high share of population is covered by high \nconvenience collection services \nDenmark applies all separate collection \nalternatives for the collection of metals, \nexcept low -density bring points in urban areas \nand civic amenity sites in rural areas. \nPlastics \npackaging \n\nPackaging waste from households \n\nA high share of population is covered by high \nconvenience collection services \nDenmark applies all separate collection \nalternatives for the collection of plastics, \nexcept low -density bring points in urban areas \nand civic amenity sites in rural areas. \n\nPackaging waste from non -household \n\nsources \nSeparation at source is mandatory for non -\nhousehold plas tic packaging waste \nSeparat ion at source is mandatory in Denmark \nfor companies \nGlass \npackaging \n\nPackaging waste from households \n\nA high share of the population is covered by \nhigh convenience collection services \nDenmark applies all separate collection \nalternatives for the collection of glass waste .\nMore than 70 % of the municipalities either \nhave door -to -door collection services or \ncollect glass in cubes within walking distance \nof the household. \n\nPackaging waste from non -household \n\nsources \nSeparation at source is mandatory for non -\nhousehold g lass packaging waste \nSeparat ion at source is mandatory in Denmark \nfor companies \nWood en \npackaging \nPackaging waste from non -household sources \nSeparation at source is mandatory for non -\nhousehold wooden packaging waste \nSeparat ion at source is mandatory in Denmark \nfor companies \nRobustness of the underlying \ninformation \nCredible information received from the Danish authorities through the \nEEA -ETC/WMGE questionnaire .\nQuantitative information on the shares of the population covered by \nthe different systems is not available. \nNote : The main source for aluminium packaging was te is drink cans from households, therefore the \nassessment does not consider aluminium non -household waste. \nSRF P -4.2: Firm plans to improve the convenience of separate collection for the different packaging \nwaste fractions \nConcrete plans are needed to improve the convenience and coverage of separate collection.

The assessment takes \nthe different situations for different types of materials into account: Plastics packaging is the \npackaging material that is the most difficult to recycle out o f the packaging materials targeted by the \nPackaging and Packaging Waste Directive. Fee modulation therefore plays a larger role for plastic \npackaging than for the other materials and is therefore rated differently from paper/cardboard, \nferrous metals, alum inium and glass . The methodology foresees a green score for plastics packaging \nonly if all four fee modulation assessment criteria mentioned above are met . On the other hand, \nwooden packaging is mainly generated by commercial and industrial sources and fee modulation is \nless relevant, therefore the methodology only relies on EPR schemes for wooden packaging from \ncommercial and industrial sources. \nAs described in Section  2.1.5  in more detail, Denmark has no EPR scheme s for packaging waste yet .\nDenmark has a deposit return system for beverage packaging made of plastic, glass or aluminium \nwhich operates similar to an EPR scheme as described above .Summary result \nSRF P-5.3.1 \nEPR scheme for Paper \nand cardboard \npackaging waste \nNo EPR scheme  Denmark has no EPR schemes yet .\nSRF P-5.3.2 \nEPR scheme for Ferrous \nmetals packaging waste \nNo EPR scheme  Denmark has no EPR schemes yet .\nSRF P-5.3.3 \nEPR scheme for \nAluminium packaging \nwaste \nNo EPR scheme  Denmark has no EPR schemes yet .\nSRF P-5.3.4 \nEPR scheme for Glass \npackaging waste \nNo EPR scheme  Denmark has no EPR schemes yet .\nSRF P-5.3.5 \nEPR scheme for Plastic \npackaging waste \nNo EPR scheme  Denmark has no EPR schemes yet .\nSRF P-5.3.6 \nEPR scheme for \nWooden packaging \nwaste \nNo EPR scheme  Denmark has no EPR schemes yet .\nRobustness of the underlying information \nCredible information received from the Danish \nauthorities through the EEA -ETC/WMGE \nquestionnaire. 34 \n2.3 Target on l andfill of municipal waste\n2.3.1 Current situation and past trends \nSRF L F-1.1 : Distance to target \nThe Landfill Directive ( 1999/31/EC ), as amended by Directive (EU) 2018/850, sets a target to \nreduce , by 2035, the amount of municipal waste landfilled to 10 % or less of the total amount \nof municipal waste generated (by weight). \nData to show the current rate of landfilling in line with the reporting rules will only be reported \nby mid -2022. Therefore, this analysis ca lculates the landfilling rate based on the current Eurostat \ndataset Municipal waste by waste management operations [env_wasmun] ; by dividing the \namount of landfilled waste by the total amount of waste generated. The overall landfilling rate \nof Denmark was 0.9 % in 2020 (Eurostat, 2022a) . Denmark has a very high incineration capacity, \nroughly double the amount of municipal waste sent to incineration , and thus landfill rates are \nexpected to stay at a low level also in the future (Danish Environmental Protection Agency, \n2021) .\nSummary result      \n\nTarget exceeded The landfilling rate of Denmark was slightly below 1 % in 2020.\nRobustness of the\nunderlying information\nThe data is derived from Eurostat and is considered to be rather\nrobust. However, the reported landfill rate might increase once the\nnew calculation rules laid down in the Commission Implementing\nDecision (EU) 2019/1885 will be applied. Based on the available\ninformation, it is currently not possible to quantify the impact of the\nnew calculation rules on the landfill rate.\n\nSRF L F-1.2 : Past trend in municipal solid waste landfill rate \nOver the past five years, the overall landfilling rate of Denmark has remained steady at about \n1 % (Figure 2.4).Figure 2.4 Landfilling in Denmark between 2015 and 20 20, in percentage \nSource : Eurostat (2022a) \nSummary result \nLandfill rate < 10%  The landfill rate of Denmark was about 1 % throughout the period \n2016 to 20 20. \nRobustness of the \nunderlying information \nThe data is derived from Eurostat and is considered to be rather \nrobust. T here is no break in the time series data. \nSRF LF -1.3: Diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from landfill \nAccording to Art. 5(2c) of the EU Landfill Directive, Member States had to ensure that by 2016, \nbiodegradable municipal waste going to landfills is reduced to 35 % of the total amount (by \nweight) of biodegradable municipal waste produced in 1995 or the lat est year before 1995 for \nwhich standardised Eurostat data is available. \nDenmark reported 0 % biodegradable waste landfilled in 2019 as share of the biodegradable \nwaste generated in 1995 , and performs therefore well within the target (EC, 2021) .\nSummary result \nTarget for reducing the \namount of biodegradable \nmunicipal waste (BMW) \nlandfilled to 35% of BMW \ngenerated in 1995 has been \nachieved in 2016 \nDenmark has reported 0 % biodegradable waste landfilled in 2019 as \nshare of the biodegradable waste generated in 1995 and performs \ntherefore well within the target. \nRobustness of the \nunderlying information \nBased on officially reported data which is well in line with otherwise \nreported statistical data on landfilling of municipal was te. 3 Conclusion \nTh is risk assessment indicate s whether Denmark at risk of not meeting the target s. The ‘total \nrisk’ categorization is the result of the sum of the individual scores of each SRF as described in \nthe previous chapter , where the assessment of each SRF results in a score of 2 points (green), 1 \npoint (amber) or 0 points (red) , depending on the assessment of the SRF. As some SRFs are \nconsidered to have a higher impact on meeting the ta rget, the score of the SRF is multiplied by \nthe defined weight of the SRF. As some SRFs might not be applicable to Denmark , only the SRFs \nrelevant to Denmark are taken into account to define the maximum score. Denmark is \nconsidered to be ‘not at risk’ if i ts score is more than 50 % of this maximum score , and ‘at risk’ \nif its score is less than 50 % of this maximum score .\n3.1 Prospects for meeting the recycling target for municipal solid waste\n65 %\nof maximum score \nBased on the provided information and the ana lysis done, \nit is concluded that Denmark is not at risk for not meeting \nthe municipal waste recycling target in 2025 .\nCurrent situation and past \ntrends :\nThe recycling rate was at 53.9 % in 2020 , which is 1.1 \npercentage points below the 2025 target. Considering, \nhowever, the impact of the new calculation rules, Denmark \nhas estimated the impact of the application of the new \ncalculation rules on the recycling rate, with the result that \nthe recycling rate would drop by 8 percentag e points, to \n45.9 %, or 9.1 percentage points below the target .\nDenmark has an increasing trend in recycling; t he recycling \nrate has increased with 5.6 percentage points during the \npast five years. \nLegal instruments :\nThe amended WFD has been transposed into national law \nin Denmark by the transposition deadline .\nDenmark reports clearly defined responsibilities, as well as \nclearly defined enforcement mechanisms for meeting the \ntargets on recycling of municipal waste, in addition \nDenmark also pre sents support mechanisms to improve \nthe implementation of the responsible entities. \nEconomic instruments :\nThere is a landfill ban for biodegradable waste and high \ntax es on both landfilling and incineration .\nDenmark has a policy for municipal waste collection which \nallows for the possibility of PAYT -schemes but \nmunicipalities often do not implement PAYT .Separate collection systems :\nA high share of population is covered by high convenience \ncollection services for paper and cardboard , metals, wood ,\nglass , plastics and WEEE . A medium share of population is \ncovered by high convenience collection services for bio -\nwaste . A low share of pop ulation is covered by high \nconvenience collection services for textiles. \nBy the end of 2022 at the latest , high convenience separate \ncollection of all examined fractions except wood waste and \nWEEE will be mandatory in all municipalities in Denmark, \nwhich w ill improve the service level and can be expected to \nincrease the capture rates of recyclables and recycling \nrates. \nExtended producer \nresponsibility :\nThe implementation process for setting up an EPR scheme \nhas started. The implementation of an EPR scheme, \ncovering all main packaging materials, is expected to have \na positive impact on the separate collection of packaging \nwaste which will, in turn, also i mpact the capture rates and \nrecycling of municipal waste .\nBio -waste treatment capacity \nand quality management :\nIncreasing the bio -waste treatment capacity is required in \norder to meet the increasing volumes of separately \ncollected bio -waste. The Danish au thorities report the \nrequired capacity demand for the treatment of biowaste \nwill be covered by the private sector or the municipalities. \nDenmark has legally binding national standards for \ncompost quality , but no quality management system yet .3.2 Prospects for meeting the recycling target s for packaging waste \n76 %\nof maximum score \nBased on the provided information and the analysis done, it is \nconcluded that Denmark is not at risk for not meeting the 65 \n% recycling target for packaging waste in 2025 \n84 % of maximum score  Paper and cardboard  Not at risk \n45 % of maximum score  Ferrous metals packaging  At risk \n84 % of maximum score  Aluminium packaging  Not at risk \n82 % of maximum score  Glass  packaging  Not at risk \n46 % of maximum score  Plastics packaging  At risk \n78 % of maximum score  Wooden packaging  Not at risk \nCurrent situation and past \ntrends :\nThe total packaging recycling rate (applying the new \ncalculation rules) in 2019 was 64.1 % , 0.9 percentage points \nbelow the 2025 target. \nThere was a small trend of decreasing recycling rates for the \nperiod 2015 -2019 , and the recycling rate in 2019 was lower \nthan in 2015. \nPlastic s and ferrous packaging waste is more than 15 \npercentage points below the target , once losses during sor ting \nand recycling are taken into account . One of t he main reasons \nfor the poor performance on plastics packaging might be that \nplastics sorting at source is still new to Danish citizens. \nLegal instruments :\nThe amended Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive has \nbeen transposed into national law .\nResponsibilities for meeting the packaging waste targets are \nplanned to change with the introduction of EPR for packaging, \nhowever the organisational set -up for the EPR scheme for \npackaging is to be decided , and enforcement and support \nmechanisms are therefore not yet clear .\nEconomic instruments :\nThere is a landfill ban for biodegradable waste and a high tax \non incineration .\nDenmark applies taxes on packaging .\nThere is a policy for municipal waste collection which allows \nfor the possibility of PAYT -schemes but municipalities often do \nnot implement PAYT .\nDenmark has a mandatory DRS is in place for all aluminium \ncans, plastic and glass bottles and a voluntary DRS for some \nspecific plastic crates. There is no DRS for wooden packaging. Separate collection \nsystems :\nAs of July 2021 and by end of 2022 at the latest , door -to -door \nor high convenience bring point separate collection of all \npackaging m aterials except wood waste will be mandatory in \nall municipalities in Denmark, aiming to further improve the \nservice level and increase the collection rates for packaging \nwaste. \nThe need for improvement and introduction of additional \nmandatory separate co llection requirements are a sign of the \ndata on rate of collection for recycling for paper and \ncardboard not being accurate, indicating also that the data for \nother packaging waste recycling may not be robust. \nSeparat ion at source is mandatory in Denmark for both \nhouseholds and also for companies. \nExtended producer \nresponsibility :\nDenmark does not have an EPR scheme for packaging yet. \nDenmark has a deposit return system covering beverage \npackaging, which operates similar to an EPR -scheme . The \nprocess for setting up an EPR scheme for all packaging has \nstarted and it is intended to be introduced no later than 31 \nDecember 2024 .

K eeping the low landfilling rate \nshould be no problem due to the high incineration capacity in \nDenmark. \nDiversion of biodegradable \nmunicipal waste from \nlandfill :\nDenmark reported 0 % biodegradable waste landfilled in 201 9\nin as share of the biodegradable waste generated in 1995 , and \nperforms therefor e well within the targe t.List of abbreviations \nAbbreviation  Name \nDRS  Deposit Return System \nEC  European Commission \nEEA  European Environment Agency \nEEE  Electrical and Electronic Equipment \nEionet  European Environmental Information and Observation Network \nEPR  Extended producer responsibility \nETC/CE  European Topic Centre on Circular Economy and resource use \nETC/WMGE  European Topic Centre on Waste and Materials in a Green Economy \nMBT  Mechanical biological treatment \nMS  Member state \nMSW  Municipal solid waste \nNWMP  National Waste Management Plan \nPAYT  Pay -as -you -throw \nPET  Polyethylene terephthalate \nPOM  Put on the market \nPPWD  Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive \nPRO  Producer Responsibility Organisation \nPVC  Polyvinyl chloride \nRR  Recycling rate \nSRF  Success and risk factor \nSUP  Single Use Plastic \nTOC  Total Organic Carbon \nWEEE  Waste Electric and Electronic Equipment \nWFD  Waste Framework Directive References \nDAKOFA, 2021, ‘Nyhed: Forbehandlingsanlæg til biopulp af madaffald’ \n(https://dakofa.dk/element/forbehandlingsanlaeg -til -biopulp -af -madaffald/) accessed 21 June \n\n\n\nDanish Environ mental Protection Agency, 2021, Questionnaire to Member States for providing \ninformation into the Early Warning analyses – Denmark. \nDanish Ministry of the Environment, 2013, Waste incineration – recovery of energy and material \nresources, \n(https://eng.ecoi nnovation.dk/media/mst/8051413/Affald_Case_Forbr%C3%A6nding_web_15 \n.01.13.pdf) accessed 18 June 2021. \nDanish Waste Association, 2021, ‘Danish symbols for waste sorting’ \n(https://danskaffaldsforening.dk/the -danish -pictograms -waste -sorting) accessed 22 June 2 021. \nDeloitte and Incentive, 2015, Kortlægning af gebyrstrukturer på affaldsområdet og analyse af \ngebyrer, der understøtter ressourcestrategiens mål om mere genanvendelse ,\nMiljøministeriet/Miljøstyrelsen (https://genanvend.mst.dk/media/131206/kortlaegnin g-af -\ngebyrstrukturer -paa -affaldsomraadet -final -2.pdf) accessed 11 February 2022. \nEC, 2019, Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/665 of 17 April 2019 amending Decision \n2005/270/EC establishing the formats relating to the database system pursuant to Eu ropean \nParliament and Council Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste (notified under \ndocument C(2019) 2805) (Text with EEA relevance.)

This transformation has occurred as a result of a dedicated and thorough policy regime that draws in key actors and assigns clear responsibilities. In the 1970s, landfilling and dumping of waste on sites lacking any kind of environmental protection was still the most common waste disposal practice in Denmark. Landfill was still so common in the 1980s that the landfill capacity was exhausted in the Copenhagen region. The generation and disposal of waste in Denmark was first mapped in 1985. This showed that 39 % of all waste and 33 % of household waste ended in landfills. The percentage of household waste landfilled was reduced to 19 % by 1995 and to 4 % by 2008, while recycling and incineration have simultaneously increased; waste is now seen as a resource to be recovered. As a consequence, many landfills receive so little waste that it is no longer economically viable to keep them fully operational (ETC/SCP, 2012, Fischer et al., 2013). The first National Waste Plan was developed in 1992, covering the period 1993–97. It included targets for recycling, incineration and landfilling of all waste (Fischer et al., 2013). Since then three plans covering the periods 1998–2004, 2005–2008 and 2009–2012 have been developed and implemented. The current plan, Denmark without Waste, Resource Plan for Waste Management 2013-2018 was adopted in 2014. The waste regulation per 1 January 2010 (Statutory order on waste 2010) changed the definition of waste regarded as MSW. All enterprises became responsible for the recycling of suitable waste under the new regulation, whereas previously, the municipalities had more authority over and duties for recyclable waste from private enterprises. In addition to household waste, fractions similar to household waste from institutions, commerce and offices had also been collected by through municipal schemes (Marcher, 2005). The change in regulation also resulted in municipalities no longer having responsibility for ensuring that sufficient recycling capacity was available either at publicly or privately owned plants for waste from institutions, commerce and offices. In order to keep 5 the coherence of the data time series, this sorted recyclable waste has been removed from municipal waste data since 1995. A new waste data system, based on the European List of Waste, was introduced in 2011 (Eurostat, 2015). Municipalities have the responsibility for introducing collection schemes to secure meeting the targets on the national level, through whichever collection scheme they choose. Practically all households in Denmark have a door-to-door collection service for residual waste. In general, 70 % of municipalities provide a source-separated collection service for paper and glass (Gibbs et al., 2014a). In addition, separate collection of further waste fractions is offered by some municipalities. In 2014, Denmark generated 4.3 million tonnes of MSW, and all generated waste was reportedly sent to treatment operations (Eurostat, 2016). 2.1 Municipal solid waste indicators The following indicators illustrate the development of Danish MSW generation and management in 2001–2014. All percentage figures have been calculated as proportions of generated waste, rather than managed waste. Figure 2.0 Denmark, municipal solid waste generation per person, 2001 – 2014 Source: Eurostat, 2016. According to Eurostat data, the generation of MSW in Denmark (Figure 2.) increased between 2001– 2008, from 606 kilograms per person to 741 kilograms, and then decreased to 673 kilogram in 2010. The considerable increase to 781 kilograms per person in MSW generation that can be seen between 2010 and 2011 may be due to the introduction of a new waste data system in 2011. In 2012-2014 MSW generation stabilized at 750–760 kilogram per person. Management of MSW in Denmark is characterised by a high degree of incineration, amounting to 54 % in 2014. It is the highest percentage and the highest amount per person in EU-28 (Eurostat, 2016). 6 2.1.1 Municipal solid waste recycling, 2001–2014 Figure 2. shows the development of recycling of MSW in Denmark related to total recycling, material recycling and composting and other biological treatment. Figure 2. illustrates a positive trend between 2001 and 2009. Total recycling increased from 31 % in 2001 to 44 % in 2009. Thereafter, the total recycling rate levelled at close to 44 %. Figure 2.1 Denmark, recycling of municipal solid waste, 2001–2014, per cent and tonnes Source: Eurostat, 2016. The increase in recycling rate is primarily linked to material recycling. The major increase in material recycling waste took place between 2007 and 2008. Most of this increase can be explained by increased generation and recycling of iron and other metals from households. There was, however, a problem with the reporting of metals from households, leading to unrealistically high amounts being recorded (ISAG Database 2012 and Miljøstyrelsen, 2011). According to the new waste data system (Table 2.1), the data for 2011–2013 show that the main waste fractions collected from households include paper, wood, packaging glass and iron and steel. Organic recycling only increased from 14 % to 17 % between 2001 and 2014, an increase from 449 000 tonnes to 743 000 tonnes. The main part of this is garden waste from households (Table 2.1). 7 Table 2.1 Denmark, main waste fractions of household waste collected, 2104, ‘000 tonnes 2011 2012 2013 Domestic and similar wastes 1 440 1 382 1 354 Waste suitable for incineration 491 469 456 Organic waste 56 54 65 Paper incl. newspapers and packaging paper 189 190 178 Packaging cardboard and other cardboard 34 38 45 Packaging glass 98 95 94 Glass 13 12 17 Packaging wood 0.4 0.4 7 Wood 76 98 117 Packaging plastic 17 15 17 Plastic 6 9 10 Packaging metal 6 6 8 Iron and steel 111 98 93 WEEE 39 40 49 Refrigerators containing freon 3 5 14 Batteries 2 1 1 Garden waste 534 551 569 Tires 4 4 4 Impregnated wood 15 13 16 PVC 1 1 1 Plaster 2 2 2 Waste suitable for landfill 72 69 50 Other wastes 63 66 106 Total 3 272.4 3218.4 3 273 Source: Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2015. The EU’s 2008 WFD includes a target for certain fractions of MSW: ‘by 2020, the preparing for re-use and the recycling of waste materials such as at least paper, metal, plastic and glass from households and possibly from other origins as far as these waste streams are similar to waste from households shall be increased to a minimum of overall 50 % by weight’. EU Member States may choose between four different methodologies to calculate compliance with the target1. Denmark has chosen calculation method 1 (Hogg et al., 2015). The recycling rates shown in this paper correspond to method 4, the only method for which time series data exist. In 2015, the European Commission has proposed new targets for municipal waste of 60 % recycling and preparing for reuse by 2025 and 65 % by 2030, based on only one calculation method, and with the option of time derogations for some countries (EC, 2015b). 1 Commission Decision 2011/753/EU allows countries to choose between four different calculation methods to report compliance with this target. Member States have the option of considering four alternative waste streams and fractions: 1. paper, metal, plastic and glass household waste; 2. paper, metal, plastic, glass household waste and other single types of household waste or of similar waste from other origins; 3. household waste; 4. municipal waste (the method used in this document). 8 2.1.2 Landfilling of biodegradable municipal waste According to the EU Landfill Directive (1999/31/EC), Member States have to reduce the amount of biodegradable municipal waste (BMW) landfilled by a specific percentage by 2006, 2009 and 2016. The targets are related to the amount of BMW generated in 1995, 1 813 000 tonnes in Denmark’s case. In 1997, Denmark implemented a landfill ban on biodegradable MSW. According to data reported to the European Commission, Denmark has not landfilled BMW for many years (EC, 2015a). Figure 2.2 Denmark, landfill of biodegradable municipal waste, 2006–2012 Source: EC, 2015a. 2.1.3 Regional differences of municipal solid waste recycling, 2001–2013 No regional data for Denmark has been reported to Eurostat. 2.1.4 Recycling and landfill taxes The Danish Landfill Tax was introduced on 1 January 1987, along with a tax on incineration. The aim was to create an incentive to reduce the amount of waste going to landfill and incineration and to promote recycling (ETC/SCP, 2012). Originally, the landfill tax included only landfills receiving waste from municipal collection schemes, but in 1989 coverage was extended to all landfills, with the exception those for hazardous waste. In 1987, the tax was DKK 40 per ton of waste (~EUR 5.3). The landfill tax was increased several times – to DKK 160 in 1993 (~EUR 21.3), DKK 335 in 1997 (~EUR 44.7), DKK 375 (~EUR 50) in 1999 and DKK 475 (~EUR 63.3) in 2010. The tax is levied on waste delivered to registered plants and a refund is granted for waste that is subsequently removed, for example, for recycling. In that way, the tax is only paid for the net amount received (ETC/SCP, 2012). The incineration tax is lower than the landfill tax. Before 2010, the incineration tax was levied per ton of waste incinerated, since 2010 it depends on the waste’s energy content (59.8 DKK/GJ), and includes also a CO2 tax (Miljøstyrelsen, 2014). 9 From 1985 to 2008, the absolute amount of household waste sent to landfill declined by 0.5 million tonnes, equivalent to a reduction of 77 %. The landfill tax has probably played a role in this reduction, together with other measures such as a ban on the landfilling of combustible waste. Figure 2.3 Denmark, landfill tax and the development of recycling, landfill and incineration of municipal solid waste, 2001–2014 Source: ETC/SCP, 2012, Eurostat, 2016, Miljøstyrelsen, 2014 The landfill tax seems to have had little impact on landfilling of MSW in the last 10 years as it was already at a low level in 2001 (Figure 2.3). Nevertheless, the landfilling rate has decreased from 7.7 % in 2001 to 1.3 % in 2014. The percentage of incineration of MSW has decreased from 61 % in 2001 to 54 % in 2014. It is likely that the incineration tax has contributed to this trend, next to the increasing policy focus on recycling. 2.1.5 Environmental benefits of better municipal solid waste management Figure 2.4 shows a scenario for greenhouse gas emissions from MSW management in Denmark. The scenario assumes a yearly growth of 0.9 % for municipal waste generation for 2011–2015 and 0.6 % for 2015–2022. The scenario also assumes that EU targets for municipal waste are fully met. The calculation of emissions is based on data and assumptions in the European Reference Model on Municipal Waste Generation and Management. The approach taken in the model is rooted in life-cycle thinking, in that it considers not only direct emissions, but also avoided emissions associated with the recycling of materials, and the generation of energy from waste management processes. The more detailed methodology is described in Gibbs et al. (2014b). The level of emissions depends on the amount of waste generated and the treatment it undergoes each year. Figure 2. shows direct emissions, avoided emissions and net emissions resulting from the management of MSW. All the emissions (positive values) represent direct operating emissions for each waste management option. The phases of the waste management chain covered include waste prevention; material recycling; composting and anaerobic digestion; mechanical biological treatment (MBT) and related technologies; collection and sorting; incineration and landfill. 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 DKK per tonne Landfill of MSW (%) Total incineration, including energy recovery (%) Total recycling (%) Material recycling (%) Composting and digestion (%) Landfill tax per tonne (DKK) 10 For avoided emissions (negative values), the calculations integrate the benefits associated with energy recovery and material recycling of paper, glass, metals, plastics, textiles and wood, and bio-treatment of food and garden waste from MSW (Gibbs et al., 2014c). Figure 2.4 Denmark, scenario for greenhouse gas emissions from municipal solid waste management in Denmark, 2011–2020 Source: ETC/WMGE, calculation based on the European Reference Model on Waste Note: Results presented in this figure should not be used for the compilation of greenhouse gas reporting for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) national inventory report, or be compared with IPCC figures, as the methodology employed here relies on life-cycle thinking and, by definition, differs substantially from the IPCC methodology. MBT means mechanical-biological treatment. In countries with a low landfill share and high recycling rate, waste treatment can have an overall positive impact on greenhouse gas emissions, reducing emissions from the economy as a whole; Denmark is one of these. Based on the modelled scenario with full policy implementation, net emissions from the treatment of municipal waste in Denmark are expected to be negative and further decrease over the period 2011–2020. Throughout the modelled period, direct greenhouse gas emissions related to municipal waste management are almost exclusively from incineration. 2.2 Uncertainties in the reporting Some uncertainties or differences in how countries report MSW recycling can result in different recycling levels. This applies, for example, to the following issues:  the extent of packaging waste from households and similar packaging from other sources included or not included in the MSW recycling reported;  the definition of municipal waste used by the country, such as the inclusion or exclusion of home composting; 11  the methodology used to report the inputs and outputs of MBT and sorting plants. Denmark does not have a producer responsibility scheme for packaging, and figures for the recycling of packaging waste are included in the municipal waste data. Until 2009, a more detailed reporting system had been used, as the general waste statistic did not deliver sufficiently good data on packaging recycling. One of the aims of the new data system for waste, introduced in 2010, was to improve the data quality for the recycling of packaging. Mechanical biological treatment plants are not used in Denmark. 2.3 Important initiatives taken to improve municipal solid waste management The major initiatives to improve MSW management in Denmark were taken before 2001. The landfill tax and incineration tax, introduced in 1987, and the total ban on the landfilling of combustible waste, agreed in 1994 and effective from 1 January 1997, have been the main drivers of the treatment of municipal waste (Fischer et al., 2013). In addition, the establishment of separate collection schemes for paper, glass packaging and garden waste has contributed significantly to the increased level of recycling. Minor initiatives were taken to improve MSW management between 2001 and 2010. The second Danish Waste Plan 1998–2004 (Waste 21) set a target of 60 % recycling for paper and cardboard waste from households and municipalities with low rates of separate collection of paper were obliged to introduce separate containers in each household for paper waste (Regeringen, 1999). The potential in tonnes was huge. The data, however, shows little change in the volume of paper collected from households between 2000 and 2009 (Miljøstyrelsen, 2011). During the last decade the recycling centres for household waste run by the municipalities have been expanded and more waste types can be delivered to the recycling centres. The third Danish Waste Plan 2005–2008 implemented the targets in the EU Directive for packaging and packaging waste that had to be fulfilled in 2008. Some initiatives focused on municipal waste. The municipalities had to implement collection schemes for metal packaging and certain types of plastic packaging (Regeringen, 2003). The introduction of a deposit system for single-use beverage packaging in 2002 increased the amount of separately collected plastic and metal packaging waste and the amount of recycling. However, the potential in tonnes for these schemes were quite small and it did not influence the total recycling of municipal waste. The fourth Danish Waste Plan 2009–2012 did not focus on new initiatives for the recycling of municipal waste other than setting a target for the collection of batteries (Regeringen, 2009). The most recent initiatives were introduced in the National Waste Management Plan (NWMP) for 201–2018, released in 2014 (Miljøstyrelsen, 2014). The initiatives presented in it are focused on meeting the recycling targets for household waste. The Danish national target is that 50 % of organic, including wood, paper, cardboard, glass, plastic, and metal waste from households is collected for recycling or material recovery by 2022, and the strategy for achieving this is based on ensuring the development of new separate collection schemes in municipalities. This will allow citizens better access to sorting and secure an increase in the recycling of waste, including organic, plastic and metal fractions. In addition, establishing partnerships between different actors, including municipalities, companies, designers and anthropologists, could help the development of simple and easily accessible waste systems (BiPRO and CRI, 2015). In 2013, Denmark also adopted the Denmark without Waste (Danmark uden affald) strategy and a number of follow-up projects have been started or finalised (Miljøstyrelsen, 2016). 12 Figure 2.5 Denmark, recycling of municipal solid waste in Denmark and important policy initiatives, 2001–2014 Source: Eurostat, 2016.– 2.4 Possible future trends According to the data presented in Figure 2., the recycling rate has increased very slowly since 2009. The 2013 Denmark without Waste strategy (Regeringen, 2013) and the NWMP 2013–2018 (Miljøstyrelsen, 2014) aim to increase the share of recycling, particularly through increased separate collection. These initiatives have only just started and it remains to be seen how effective they will be. 13 References BiPRO and CRI, 2015, National factsheet on separate collection – Denmark, prepared within the EC study Assessment of separate collection schemes in the 28 capitals of the EU.

With the growing population, urbanization, and industrialization, waste generation continues to increase, posing significant challenges for countries across the globe. However, waste recycling offers a solution to mitigate the adverse effects of waste accumulation.\n\nDenmark's commitment to recycling is driven by the country's focus on reducing its environmental footprint, conserving natural resources, and enhancing its circular economy. A significant part of this commitment involves using modern waste disposal machines like bag opener machines, shredder machines, and trommel screen machines, which play an essential role in transforming waste into reusable materials.\n\nIn this, we’ll explore what waste recycling is, its importance, the waste recycling machines involved, and why Denmark should continue to embrace and invest in recycling technologies. We will also highlight the benefits of adopting a robust waste recycling system and how it contributes to building a more sustainable future for generations to come.\n\nWhat Is Waste Recycling?\n\nWaste recycling is the process of converting waste materials into reusable materials to prevent unnecessary waste accumulation. This involves collecting, sorting, and processing waste into new products that can be used again, reducing the demand for raw materials and decreasing energy consumption. Essentially, waste recycling is a crucial aspect of waste management that reduces environmental pollution, conserves resources, and contributes to economic sustainability.\n\nThe recycling process includes several stages. First, waste is collected and sorted, either manually or with the help of machines like bag opener machines and shredder machines. After sorting, materials are processed to extract valuable raw materials that can be reused in manufacturing. Finally, these raw materials are used to create new products, reducing the need for virgin resources and minimizing the overall environmental impact.\n\nBenefits of Waste Recycling\n\nThe importance of waste recycling cannot be overstated. Here are the key benefits that recycling offers:\n\nEnvironmental Conservation\n\nWaste recycling plays an important role in protecting the environment. By reusing materials, we reduce the need to mine, extract, and process raw materials, which can cause significant environmental damage. For example, recycling paper reduces the number of trees cut down, while recycling metals reduces the harmful impacts of mining. Moreover, recycling helps minimize the emission of harmful gases like carbon dioxide, contributing to the fight against climate change.\n\nReduction in Landfill Waste\n\nOne of the most significant benefits of waste recycling is its ability to divert waste from landfills. Recycling helps to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills, which not only conserves valuable land but also prevents the release of harmful gases like methane from landfills. This is important for maintaining a clean and safe environment.\n\nEnergy Conservation\n\nRecycling is also an energy-efficient process. In many cases, recycling materials like aluminum, glass, and paper requires significantly less energy than producing new products from raw materials. For example, recycling aluminum saves up to 95% of the energy needed to produce aluminum from raw bauxite ore.\n\nEconomic Growth\n\nThe waste recycling industry contributes to the economy by creating jobs in collection, sorting, and processing recyclable materials. Additionally, by using recycled materials, industries can save on raw material costs and reduce manufacturing expenses. This leads to more affordable products for consumers and enhanced economic stability for businesses.\n\nSustainability and Circular Economy\n\nAt the core of waste recycling is the concept of a circular economy. In a circular economy, materials are used, reused, and recycled, forming a closed-loop system that reduces waste and conserves resources.\n\nMachines Used for Waste Recycling\n\nTo effectively recycle waste, various machines are employed to automate and streamline the process. The following are some of the essential waste disposal machines used in recycling facilities:\n\nBag Opener Machine\n\nThe Bag Opener machine  is a vital piece of equipment in recycling facilities, particularly when it comes to processing large amounts of waste. These machines are designed to open bags filled with various waste materials, such as plastics, papers, metals, and food scraps. The bag opener machine helps break open these bags and allows for easy sorting and processing of the waste inside.\n\nShredder Machine\n\nThe shredder machine plays a critical role in reducing the size of waste materials for easier handling and processing. Waste materials such as plastic, cardboard, paper, and even electronic waste are fed into the shredder machine, where they are cut into smaller pieces. These shredded materials can then be sorted, compacted, and processed for recycling.\n\nTrommel Screen Machine\n\nThe trommel screen machine is a rotating drum used to separate materials based on their size. The waste materials are loaded into the drum, which rotates and allows smaller particles to fall through the perforated holes while larger pieces remain inside the drum. This sorting process is essential in waste recycling, as it helps separate recyclable materials from non-recyclable ones and ensures better processing of the waste.\n\nWhy Denmark Should Prioritize Recycling\n\nDenmark has long been a pioneer in waste management and recycling. With a population of over 80 million people, the country produces substantial amounts of waste.\n\nThe need for effective waste recycling in Denmark is critical due to several factors:\n\nBy prioritizing waste recycling, Denmark can not only reduce the environmental impact of waste but also ensure a more sustainable and resource-efficient future for its citizens.\n\nWhy Choose Black Smith for Waste Recycling Solutions?\n\nAt Black Smith, we specialize in providing high-quality waste disposal machines like bag opener machines, shredder machines, and trommel screen machines to enhance recycling operations.

This solution will have the greatest benefit to the environment if supporting interventions are targeted at types of plastic pollution that are the most damaging from an ecological and wider risk perspective. Interventions should target three aspects of the pollution: reducing barriers to collection, improving the revenue from the materials and wider informal recycler remuneration, and increasing the quality of the materials. Done well, these interventions will increase the collection rate, reduce pollution from plastics, and help millions of people escape poverty. They present a scalable international solution to a global challenge; and are likely the only viable solution to the widespread lack of solid waste services and infrastructure across low- and middle-income countries.\n\nPrevious article in issue\nNext article in issue\n\nKeywords\nInformal recycling sector\nWaste pickers\nPlastic pollution\nMarine litter\nSolid waste\nCircular economy\n1. Introduction\nPlastic is everywhere. We talk on it, we drive in it, and we make heart valves and artificial joints with it. Despite the many improvements plastic has made to our modern lives, its global mismanagement has led to its widespread release into the environment (‘plastic pollution’), with disastrous environmental consequences. Fortunately, a pool of 11 million plus waste pickers, who are in fact plastics recycling experts (Velis, 2017), may be our best hope for preventing this global failure. We propose using the environmental and wider risk posed by this pollution to target interventions to support these recyclers and benefit the environment.\nPlastic pollution has ubiquitous impacts on human and natural systems. For instance, more than 700 marine species have been demonstrably affected by this pollution, with the number growing rapidly as more species are studied (Gall and Thompson, 2015). Additionally, there is much discussion about the potential impacts to human health, via toxicological effects through the food system (Rochman, 2015). Its economic costs are also significant, with marine plastic alone estimated to cost between 6 and 19 billion US dollars globally in 2018, accounting for its impact on tourism, fisheries, aquaculture and clean-up activities (Viool et al., 2019). However, the negative effects of plastic pollution differs across items, species and contexts, with disproportionate impacts resulting from particular items (Wilcox et al., 2016) (e.g., plastic straps, plastic bags and fishing gear) due to their propensity to entangle animals or obstruct the gut if ingested. The damage from this pollution is thus a product of the impact of a particular item and its rate of loss into the environment (Fig. 1).\n\n\nDownload: Download high-res image (182KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\n\nFig. 1. How we target interventions can take into account the relationship between leakage and harm. Some items such as thin film and packing straps have disproportionately high harmful impacts on ecosystems and are frequently lost to the environment. Other items (e.g., microbeads) are lost to the environment readily, but their resultant ecological harm, whilst still uncertain, is thought to be low (and bans have been implemented). Identifying where items fall on leakage and harm spectrum can maximize environmental benefits and support the informal sector. Although this figure expresses harm in terms of ecological harm, there are many other forms harm can take such as harm to human health, infrastructure (e.g. blocking of storm drains leading to flooding), or economic harm (damage to tourism or clean-up costs).\nWorld leaders are now taking full notice of the ‘plastic pollution crisis’, as reflected in the UNEA-5.2 resolution to work towards a global legally binding treaty to ending plastic pollution (UNEP/EA.5/L.23/Rev.1), putting waste management failures in the spotlight (Silva Filho and Velis, 2022). In the meantime, China stopped accepting imports of certain recyclable waste in 2018, disrupting global plastic recycling markets and making the world acutely aware of the potential mismanagement of globally traded secondary resources; a sustainability crisis we could have anticipated (Velis, 2014, Velis, 2015). With the present focus by the United Nations on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to reduce land-sourced pollution in oceans (SDG Target 14.1), improve livelihoods for the World’s poor (SDG 1), and improve life in cities by sound waste collection and disposal (SDG Indicator 11.6.1) (UN Environment, 2018), there is an immediate, imperative opportunity for synergistic strategies that achieve multiple goals simultaneously.\n2. Informal recycling – A rapid solution to plastic pollution\nThe key to stopping plastics pollution is to target the primary source; that of uncollected waste (Velis et al., 2017b, Williams et al., 2019). Around 3 billion people worldwide lack access to regular municipal solid waste (MSW) collection and/or controlled disposal services (Wilson and Velis, 2015). Therefore, without implementing waste collection services for recycling, or at least collection for controlled disposal (engineered landfill), the tap on plastics pollution cannot be turned off (Velis et al., 2017b). In a recent study, a business as usual scenario projected more than 1.36 billion metric tonnes of plastic will accumulate on land or in aquatic environments from 2016 to 2040 if we do not act (Lau et al., 2020).\nThe global size of the informal waste and recycling sector has been recently conservatively estimated at 11.4 million waste pickers (Lau et al., 2020) and previously at between 12.5 and 56 million (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2016). These individuals are already delivering efficient, viable plastics recovery. This is particularly relevant in the lowest income countries, where most of the solid waste is at risk of ‘leaking’ into the environment due to insufficient formal solid waste management services and infrastructure. When using the estimate of 11.4 million waste pickers, calculations reveal as much as 27.4 million tonnes of plastic is currently being collected globally by waste pickers (Lau et al., 2020), plastic which otherwise may have entered the environment. Waste pickers and their wider supply chains are therefore already an important part of the solution to plastic pollution.\nDespite this contribution the informal recycling sector (IRS) currently make, global plastic recycling is still modest in comparison to other recyclables such as paper, estimated by weight at just 9 % (OECD, 2022). Intergovernmental bodies, such as the G20 countries, are working to coordinate responses to plastic pollution and build the groundwork for both effective waste management and the development of a circular economy. A G20 statement on marine litter contains seven sections, two of which focus exclusively on infrastructure development, operational establishment, and funding of the formal waste management sector. However, the role of the informal sector in addressing waste received scant attention. For instance, the only mention of the informal sector in the G20 Action Plan on Marine Litter (G20, 2017) is, “Where needed, integrate informal waste workers into modernized waste management systems in order to improve their working conditions and livelihoods”. This does not suggest including and integrating the IRS broadly as part of the system, and in direct contrast to the statements about the formal sector, it does not support targeting funding on capacity and infrastructure development to enable their efforts. The mentioning of the informal actors in the UNEP/EA.5/L.23/Rev.1 Resolution (“Recognizing the significant contribution made by workers under informal and cooperative settings to collecting, sorting and recycling plastics in many countries”) could serve as a basis for a more just transition to ending plastic pollution.\nWe acknowledge the critical role that innovation in materials, durability, and consumption patterns will play in reaching a sustainable circular economy. However, if waste is not collected, the inherent value of its constituent materials cannot be delivered back into the economy. Definitions of circular economy propose that after first-use, materials are best maintained at their highest point of ‘value’ for multiple cycles (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2016). Generally, plastics currently follow a linear approach (make, use, dispose) rather than a circular economy approach (design for use, recover, redesign). For instance, a PET bottle increases in value as it moves from the raw material through to its final point of sale and use (Fig. 2). However, after use the bottle’s value is frequently degraded through secondary uses, mixing with other waste, and finally being lost into the environment (Fig. 2). These processes reduce the economic value of the item, by reducing its quality or increasing the effort required to recover it.\n\n\nDownload: Download high-res image (496KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\n\nFig. 2. Plastic materials and products have different value at each stage of its life within a circular economy. Sufficient value should be available to be appropriated by those who collect, sort, and clean the materials, and the waste pickers need support in delivering this service at scale (Solution 1). The massive drop in value when plastic items become waste, and its direct competition with virgin material on price, does not help its collection for recycling at scale. This needs fixing, for example by product stewardship schemes such as (extended) producer responsibility (EPR)(Rutkowski, 2020), whilst prices should also reflect the environmental harm of particular items (Solution 2). By better understanding the necessary quality of recyclables, higher quantities of more suitable recycled materials can be targeted (Solution 3). All three solutions combined can serve as levers to prevent plastics pollution in a cost-effective, rapid, and socially responsible way.\nWhile circular economy and its supporting recycling system is a laudable long-term goal, it will require significant investment and multi-year to decadal development times. For instance, extending formal waste management across India via public private partnerships (PPP) would require US$5 billion every year, if it is even possible to implement on the ground (EY and ASSOCHAM, 2019). In contrast, the informal sector requires relatively little infrastructure, is highly responsive to economic signals, and is very flexible in its operations (Scheinberg et al., 2010). By targeting our interventions around enabling the informal sector to collect and recycle after-use plastics, we can immediately begin to tackle plastic pollution.\n3. How should we target interventions?\nWaste pickers customarily separate materials, components, and products of sufficient value to support their livelihood. However, not all waste items leak into the environment in the same quantities, nor do all items cause similar harm once they become pollutants (Wilcox et al., 2016). Therefore, focusing interventions and providing additional incentives on items such as plastic films, bags and packing straps that are frequently lost into the environment and result in high harm (Fig. 1) is key to maximizing the environmental benefits of investments and supporting the informal sector.\nThe informal sector faces three key issues that affect the value of waste items: search times, material price, and material quality. These issues are prominent for the currently uncollected items, which are often widely dispersed and mixed with other waste. If we can develop strategies to shift these factors for the informal sector, they will respond rapidly, delivering reduced environmental damage, while increasing economic returns and potentially better human health outcomes.\nWe contend that organizing, legitimizing, and expanding waste picking activities, as part of a “just transition” (Schröder, 2020), focused on door-to-door collection rather than from dumpsites, is a fast, affordable and implementable strategy for preventing plastics pollution in the short to medium term. To do this, three critical solutions/ levers are suggested (Fig. 2):\n\n\n1.\nExpand and improve IRS collection;\n\n\n2.\nImprove revenue from recycled materials;\n\n\n3.\nImprove materials quality.\n\n\nIf these efforts are targeted at the particularly damaging types of plastics, we can substantially reduce the impacts of plastic pollution in the near term, whilst implementing other long-term improvements such as packaging innovations or formal waste collection infrastructure. Below, we address this three-pronged approach to linking the informal sector and plastic pollution and provide a successful example for each.\n3.1. Expanding and improving IRS collection\nVirtually all recycling in low-income countries is accomplished by the informal sector, of which many diverse roles exist (Velis et al., 2017a). Simplifying, most waste picking occurs at dumpsites, where material is concentrated and collection is performed by unorganized individuals and marginalized communities (Fig. 3A). However, the most valuable items are often recovered from the streets or doorsteps of householders. One key transformative action therefore needed is enabling waste pickers to move away from dumpsites and street picking, becoming collection service providers, itinerant waste buyers and sorters in organized environments and entrepreneurial structures they own and run (Velis et al., 2012) (Fig. 3B). This is the case in Metro Manila in the Philippines where the IRS cooperative known as Linis Ganda organized waste pickers to collect recyclables directly from households whilst simultaneously strengthening the links with waste dealers and encouraging waste segregation at source (Wilson et al., 2009). Likewise, the SWaCH cooperative in Pune, India formed a pro-poor Public Private Partnership (PPP) with the municipal administration to provide door-to-door collection services to around half of all households, including many informal settlements where waste collection is typically more challenging. The cooperative earns income from charging households collection fees, whilst further supporting their income from the sale of recyclable materials (Chikarmane, 2012).\n\n\nDownload: Download high-res image (604KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\n\nFig. 3. (A) Mismanaged solid waste is the major source for plastics pollution. Unorganized waste pickers are targeting plastics material for recycling, but often under problematic and sub-optimal conditions, as in this case in Dandora informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya. (B): Collecting plastics for recycling before entering the environment by an organized informal recycling sector (IRS) is a much more effective and affordable solution, whilst also improving working conditions. An IRS door-to-door collector has elaborately decorated their cart to make a statement in the streets of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Photo rights: ©Authors. (C): Fate of after-use municipal solid waste plastics worldwide (waste quantities represented by areas not in scale). Environmentally sound disposal is unavailable to around 3 billion people, whose solid waste becomes (plastics) pollution (purple shows where IRS is currently involved in waste management). The informal recycling sector already recycles substantial quantities in the absence of formal mixed collection or recycling services. With revenue incentives, organization and support, the IRS could collect massive quantities (dotted line depicts expanded IRS opportunity) of after-use plastics in a timely, effective and affordable way for recycling, preventing it from becoming plastic pollution.\nSupporting the informal sectors efforts and encouraging the provision of door-to-door collection has the potential to benefit the working conditions and livelihoods of the informal sector, whilst simultaneously reducing plastic pollution from uncollected waste by promoting improved collection services (Fig. 3 C). Furthermore, organizing the IRS into cooperatives/ associations or other micro-business structures increases market material knowledge and hence incomes in the sector. Simple innovations such as smartphone applications like Cataki (2019) in Sao Paulo, Brazil, have assisted people in locating material for collection. By supporting network organization among the waste pickers and creating a trust market with households, these systems make provision of collection services by the informal sector economically viable. The systems also assist pickers in achieving fair market value for materials, as price information can be shared across the network. Issues with digital access may limit this solution but use of smartphones is already extensive amongst the World’s poor – e.g. for electronic wallet and microfinancing purposes in Africa.\n3.2. Improving revenue from recycled materials\nInterventions to recover the full cost of collecting and returning after-use plastics into the production cycle are fundamental prerequisite for reducing plastic pollution. The price of reclaimed (secondary) material is typically substantially lower than the price of primary plastics. If this material is to not to be dispersed in the environment and it is to be reclaimed in a circular economy, it must be valued in a way that makes it financially comparable to primary plastic. Simply put, if the positive (saving in primary resources) and negative (damage from ‘environmental leakage’) costs are not incorporated into the price of secondary goods placed on the market, the economics of recycling do not stack up. Incorporating averted harm or damage into the ‘value’ placed on plastics can incentivize collection of such items prior to them being lost into the environment.\nIncentives could be provided to expand recovery activities, targeting high environmentally damaging items, including those that are currently considered unrecyclable. In this way, regulation of the materials market could help to correct for the inability of the free market to incorporate the cost of collection, treatment, or environmental harm from plastics at the end of life.\nThis inclusion of environmental harm costs in product/services pricing has already proven to be a success in reducing plastic pollution, such as the deposit refund/return scheme implemented in Estonia that targets heavily littered items such as plastic bottles (Balcers et al., 2019). Additionally, in South Africa, the plastics industry has implemented a voluntary Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme to promote PET recycling by the IRS (Godfrey and Oelofse, 2017, PETCO, 2017). In doing so, the informal sector is protected from price fluctuations, allowing the development of a reliable supply chain. In the absence of such protection, during periods of low prices, workers shift to other activities, causing disruption in the supply of recycled materials, thus preventing the establishment of an economically viable supply chain. This system has resulted in collection rates of 65% for the targeted material (PET) and provides livelihoods for thousands of people (PETCO, 2017).\nNew systems and sustainability analysis methodologies have recently been developed to quantify the ‘value’ of plastic waste and its removal more broadly (e.g. to include social, environmental and economic aspects) and in a circular economy context (Millward-Hopkins et al., 2018a, Millward-Hopkins et al., 2018b). Such approaches can help us understand how value in relation to plastic items is generated, appropriated and destroyed, enabling us to intervene to retain this value, incentivizing collection and thus reducing environmental and economic damage.\n3.3. Improving material quality\nPlastics recovered from dumpsites rather than collected at source (e.g. door to door) are more likely fouled by organic or other waste, which poses major challenges in conventional recycling systems. By transitioning to door-to-door collection and encouraging segregation at source, physical contamination (non-targeted materials / items) can be reduced and therefore the quality and value of the item increased. For example, improvement of material quality through segregation at source is the most influential area for intervention, as demonstrated though value chain analysis of the Zabaleen informal recycling sector in Cairo, Egypt (Jaligot et al., 2016).\nWaste pickers are world experts in recognizing after-use plastics types and instantly assessing on the spot their recyclability. For example, in a collection and sorting cooperative in Brazil, pickers can quickly sort plastics into 17 grades, reflecting secondary plastic market needs and end-use outlets (Purshouse et al., 2017). This is partly feasible as financial support is provided by the regional government to operatives in the form of salaries for delivering ‘environmental services’ (Rutkowski and Rutkowski, 2015) (see solution 2). Enabling standardized descriptions and quantification of secondary plastics quality, and training waste pickers in these skills will increase the chance for materials to be recovered rather than lost to the environment.\n4. Synergies between solutions – Addressing systemic complexity\nWe recognize that the three-pronged solutions proposed are inevitably a simplification of a highly complex system, featuring also considerable variability across the world. Despite such complexities, we maintain that these three areas of intervention could be the core elements in addressing plastic pollution by means of the IRS, enabling functional and sustainable solutions. Similarly, although presented here as separate solutions, in reality significant overlap and synergies exist between each of them. For example, by pricing plastics at a level that reflects the appropriate value of plastic pollution prevention, the economics would shift in favor of increasing collection services to recover this valuable material. Likewise, by focusing on improving material quality through segregation at source, improvements to the value of after-use plastics are realized and therefore the price is also increased. Enabling door-to-door collection by informal collection services or itinerant buyers would also provide benefits to material quality by encouraging direct interaction and education of households by the IRS (Rutkowski and Rutkowski, 2015).\n5. Legitimizing the informal sector reduces poverty\nThere is considerable evidence that the IRS can be empowered to provide affordable, high-quality collection and sorting services (Velis, 2017, Velis et al., 2012). We also acknowledge the considerable challenges around marginalization, exploitation, abuse, child labor, and reduced community health due to picking from dumpsites and working without any personal protective equipment (Cook and Velis, 2021, Velis, 2017, Velis and Cook, 2021, Velis et al., 2012). However, with appropriate economics in place, organized services (such as cooperatives, associations or community-based organizations) can be deployed at scale to capture a sizable proportion of plastics that are mechanically recyclable. Legitimization and wider inclusion of the IRS has been applied extensively across Latin America, with tools currently available to assist with such processes (The Economist Intelligence Unit, 2017, Velis et al., 2012). This approach has resulted in reduced poverty and enhanced societal inclusion for organized IRS, where employed.\n6. A rapid, inexpensive, just and scalable solution\nAddressing underlying systemic failures is key to reducing plastic pollution (Velis et al., 2017b). Legitimizing and integrating waste pickers mobilizes an incredibly valuable source of human capital. Our three-pronged framework provides a roadmap for tapping the unrealized potential of the informal waste sector to contribute an effective, rapid, inclusive, and inexpensive solution to prevent plastics pollution. This needs to be combined with long-term efforts to innovate plastic materials and product design to enable sustainable circularity and to support material recovery.\nSimple interventions in the framework provided can dramatically reduce plastic pollution and benefit the livelihoods of millions of waste pickers by improving collection, price/revenues and material quality. Examples of how to achieve these changes include moving from collection at dumpsites to door-to-door collection, choosing incentives that economically address the misfit between the value in recovered plastics and current pricing, and improving material identification. This shift may have significant benefits for the workers, while at the same time addressing the key source of plastic pollution: unmanaged waste dumped along streets or in the environment. By targeting these interventions at the waste items with the highest leakage rates and environmental and wider damages, it is feasible to address the global plastic pollution problem.\nFunding\nThis University of Leeds (UoL) – CSIRO collaboration was funded by an internal short term internationalization mobility fund for early career researchers of University of Leeds, Faculty of Engineering and Physical Science, enabling a two week research visit at the CISRO premises, in Hobart, Tasmania.\nAuthor Contributions\nThe manuscript was written through contributions of all authors.

Similarly, established programs in Germany, Norway, and Sweden have seen sustained success and have expanded to include a broader array of packaging (Velis et al., 2022). These variations highlight the complexities of consumer behavior as a critical determinant in the varied success of these initiatives (Chioatto and Sospiro, 2023).\nShow abstract\nThis policy article addresses the urgent need for a comprehensive policy framework to advance the circular economy, a crucial strategy in mitigating the global waste and pollution crisis. It seeks to bridge the research gap by evaluating and structuring circular economy policies across various governance levels, employing an ecological economics perspective. Through a synthesis of literature and case studies, the article examines the effectiveness of regulatory policies, economic incentives, and voluntary measures, and confronts the cultural, behavioral, economic, regulatory, technical, and logistical barriers to implementation. The findings underscore the importance of integrated policy approaches, such as extended producer responsibility, environmental taxes, and corporate sustainability practices, offering actionable insights for stakeholders. This contribution is significant for its strategic recommendations, which are vital for transitioning towards sustainable development and operationalizing the circular economy in practice.\n\n\nAdvancing plastic pollution hotspotting at the subnational level: Brazil as a case study in the Global South\n2023, Marine Pollution Bulletin\nShow abstract\nIdentifying sources is crucial for proposing effective actions to combat marine litter pollution. Here, we used an innovative approach to identify hotspots of mismanaged plastic waste (MPW) within Brazil and subsequent leakage to the ocean, based on population density, socio-economic conditions, municipal solid waste management and environmental parameters. We estimated plastic waste generation and MPW for each of the 5570 Brazilian municipalities, which totaled 3.44 million metric tons per year. Then, we estimated the probability of litter mobilization and transport (P) and the relative risk of leakage to the ocean (MPW × P). The Guanabara Bay and La Plata River comprised the main oceanic entry hotspots of litter produced in Brazil. The use of national databases allowed us to increase spatial and temporal granularity, offering a detailed baseline for the application of prevention and mitigation actions. However, overcoming data limitations is still a challenge in Brazil as in other Global South countries.\n\n\nInformal recyclers as stakeholders in a circular economy\n2023, Journal of Cleaner Production\nCitation Excerpt :\nThe total number of informal recyclers around the world is difficult to estimate. According to different sources published at different points in time, it ranges from 11.4 million people (Lau et al., 2020; Velis et al., 2022) to at least 15 million people (Medina, 2008; Binion and Gutberlet, 2012) and to even more than 20 million people (Gutberlet, 2021; Sanders, 2022). With their tacit knowledge, informal recyclers create value by identifying, collecting, segregating, refurbishing, and recycling different types of solid waste streams, amongst other activities (Dias, 2016; Ogwueleka and Naveen, 2021).\nShow abstract\nThe inclusion of the informal recycling sector (IRS) in a circular economy (CE) is challenging and it is gaining increasing attention by the academic community in an exponential yet fragmented way. In this narrative review, we demarcate the direct and indirect contributions of the IRS to various domains of the CE by drawing knowledge from relevant literature. First, we capture the modi operandi of different forms of recycling value chains into a typology. We do so based on distinct foci and policy approaches towards the IRS which have been adopted across different countries. Second, we synthesize various threads of information on reported forms of collaboration, tensions, and challenges in the context of urban waste management, into a conceptual framework to facilitate transitions towards circular and inclusive wise-waste systems. Finally, we discuss important aspects related to circular business models and integration approaches towards the IRS, and we propose avenues for further research.\n\n\nPlastic waste reprocessing for circular economy: A systematic scoping review of risks to occupational and public health from legacy substances and extrusion\n2023, Science of the Total Environment\nCitation Excerpt :\nAround 2 billion people receive no municipal solid waste collection service (Wilson et al., 2015) and have to self-manage, mainly by scattering on land, or more commonly by open burning (Velis and Cook, 2021), estimated by Lau et al. (2020) at 18 and 49 million tonnes (Mt) per annum respectively for the plastic fraction. Virtually all of the material collected for recycling in LIMICs is carried out by waste pickers (Velis et al., 2022); informal entrepreneurs who may number between 10 and 20 million (Wilson et al., 2015; Lau et al., 2020). Plastic sorting and reprocessing operations are often smaller, and in some cases poorly regulated, without any environmental or occupation and public health protection in place (Kosgeroglu et al., 2004).\nShow abstract\nThe global plastics reprocessing sector is likely expand as the circular economy becomes more established and efforts to curb plastic pollution increase. Via a critical systematic scoping review (PRISMA-ScR), we focused on two critical challenges for occupational and public health that will require consideration along with this expansion: (1) Legacy contamination in secondary plastics, addressing the risk of materials and substances being inherited from the previous use and carried (circulated or transferred) through into new products when reprocessed material enters its subsequent use phase (recycled, secondary plastic); and, (2) Extrusion of secondary plastics during the final stage of conventional mechanical reprocessing. Based on selected literature, we semi-quantitatively assessed nine risk scenarios and ranked them according to the comparative magnitude of risk to human health. Our analysis highlights that despite stringent regulation, industrial diligence and enforcement, occasionally small amounts of potentially hazardous substances contained in waste plastics are able to pass through established safeguards and re-enter (cascade into) the next use phase (product cycle) after being recycled. Although many of these ‘inherited’ chemical substances are present at concentrations unlikely to pose a serious and imminent threat, their existence may indicate a wider or possible increase in pollution dispersion. Our assessment indicates that the highest risk results from exposure to these substances during extrusion by mechanical reprocessors in contexts where only passive ventilation, dilution and dispersion are used as control measures.

With the focus of the Millennium Development Goals on poverty reduction, and of waste strategies on improving recycling rates, one of the major challenges in solid waste management in developing countries is how best to work with this informal sector to improve their livelihoods, working conditions and efficiency in recycling.\nThe general characteristics of informal recycling are reviewed, highlighting both positive and negative aspects. Despite the health and social problems associated with informal recycling, it provides significant economic benefits that need to be retained. Experience shows that it can be highly counterproductive to establish new formal waste recycling systems without taking into account informal systems that already exist. The preferred option is to integrate the informal sector into waste management planning, building on their practices and experience, while working to improve efficiency and the living and working conditions of those involved. Issues associated with integrating informal recycling into the formal waste management sector are discussed.\nIntroduction\nThe informal sector is characterised by small-scale, labour-intensive, largely unregulated and unregistered, low-technology manufacturing or provision of services (Wilson, Whiteman, & Tormin, 2001). Informal sector entrepreneurs or enterprises do not pay taxes, have no trading license and are not included in social welfare or government insurance schemes (Haan, Coad, & Lardinois, 1998). In the context of municipal solid waste management (MSWM), the informal recycling sector refers to the waste recycling activities of scavengers and waste pickers. These terms are used to describe those involved in the extraction of recyclable and reusable materials from mixed waste. These activities epitomise the informal sector as this is labour-intensive, low-technology, low-paid, unrecorded and unregulated work, often completed by individuals or family groups. More complicated organisations can form, such as micro and small enterprises (MSEs) involving groups of up to 10 (micro), or 20 (small) people, operating with low capital investment. They provide primary collection and processing of collected materials into intermediate or final products, using creativity and innovation to respond cost effectively to market needs (Ahmed & Ali, 2004).\nSpecific socio-economic conditions prevail in many economically developing countries, including rapid population growth, migration to urban areas, lack of sufficient funds and affordable services and generally a low-skilled labour force. Solid waste management systems are often poorly run and operate to low standards. They can be unreliable, provide inadequate coverage and may conflict with other urban services. Developing country cities often collect only between 50% and 80% of waste generated, with open dumping the only disposal method available (Medina & Dows, 2000). Insufficient collection, uncontrolled street collection points and improper disposal in open dumps allow refuse to be readily available for informal waste recycling through scavenging/waste picking.\nThe attitude of the formal waste management sector to informal recycling is often very negative, regarding it as backward, unhygienic and generally incompatible with a modern waste management system. On the other hand, one of the aims of modern waste management is to move ‘up the waste hierarchy,’ i.e. reduce the reliance on disposal and increase recycling: it would seem ironic to move forward by deliberately eliminating what can be a rather efficient, existing recycling system. Also, the Millennium Development Goals (UN, 2005) focus development efforts on poverty reduction, and again it would seem counter-intuitive to try to move forward by removing the means of livelihood from a major section of the urban poor.\nThis paper reviews the role of informal waste recycling in achieving more sustainable waste management in developing countries. It identifies both the benefits the informal recycling sector provides to the local economy and its characteristics of concern. Public policy changes required to integrate informal recycling with the formal waste management sector are discussed.\nSection snippets\nInformal waste recycling in developing countries\nInformal waste recycling is carried out by poor and marginalised social groups who resort to scavenging/waste picking for income generation and some even for everyday survival. This is widespread throughout urban areas of the developing world and it is reported that up to 2% of the population in Asian and Latin American cities depend on waste picking to earn their livelihood (Medina, 2000). This is an adaptive response to scarcity by disadvantaged populations. Informal recyclers often form\nOrganisation types and the recycling trade hierarchy\nThe way informal recycling activities are organised has important consequences for income generation, working conditions and social status. As a general rule, the less organised the informal recycling sector is, the less the people involved are capable of adding value to the secondary raw materials they collect, and the more vulnerable they are to exploitation from intermediate dealers.\nSecondary materials collected by informal recycling are normally traded locally. Possible end-users are local\nEconomic driving forces for informal recycling\nThe informal recycling sector is often highly skilled at identifying wastes with potential value. They collect materials when they have been discarded as waste and add value to them by sorting, cleaning, altering the physical shape to facilitate transport or by aggregating materials (Scheinberg, 2001a) into a commercially viable quantity, as shown in Fig. 3. Table 2 describes the ways in which value can be added to recovered waste materials. Potential profit margin is the main selection\nEconomic and social issues\nInformal recycling systems can bring significant economic benefits to developing countries. From a macroeconomic perspective, they are well adapted to the prevailing conditions, namely abundant supply of working force, but scarce capital: they minimise capital expenditures and maximise hand (and animal) power (Haan et al., 1998; Scheinberg, 2001a). They are able to provide a steady, reliable supply of secondary raw materials for local manufacturing industry which can replace more expensive\nHealth impacts of informal recycling\nHealth and safety risks associated with informal recycling include (1) occupational health risks posed to scavenger/waste pickers and (2) community health risks posed to the related community or general public. These risks can originate from the nature of the waste or the process of collecting, processing, recycling and disposing of it. Table 3 summarises the waste-related factors that may pose risk (Cointreau, undated). Informal waste pickers are undoubtedly exposed to increased risks as basic\nPublic policies towards informal waste recycling\nPublic policy in waste management has been traditionally driven by the need to control public health and the environmental consequences of poor waste management and this determines the legal context in which informal recycling operates. In many countries, public policies towards the informal sector are largely negative. This may be characterised as repression, where either embarrassment at the presence of scavengers or ‘concern’ for their inhuman and unhygienic working and living conditions has\nIntegrating informal recycling into formal MSWM\nTo convince municipal authorities and politicians to move from their traditional policies of repression and neglect of, or collusion with, the informal recycling sector to one of positive engagement, support and integration with the formal MSWM system is a major challenge.

It occurs in many developing countries, including China, where current gaps in environmental management, high demand for second-hand electronic appliances and the norm of selling e-waste to individual collectors encourage the growth of a strong informal recycling sector. This paper gathers information on informal e-waste management, takes a look at its particular manifestations in China and identifies some of the main difficulties of the current Chinese approach. Informal e-waste recycling is not only associated with serious environmental and health impacts, but also the supply deficiency of formal recyclers and the safety problems of remanufactured electronic products. Experiences already show that simply prohibiting or competing with the informal collectors and informal recyclers is not an effective solution. New formal e-waste recycling systems should take existing informal sectors into account, and more policies need to be made to improve recycling rates, working conditions and the efficiency of involved informal players. A key issue for China’s e-waste management is how to set up incentives for informal recyclers so as to reduce improper recycling activities and to divert more e-waste flow into the formal recycling sector.\n\n\nImpacts of plastic pollution on ecosystem services, sustainable development goals, and need to focus on circular economy and policy interventions\n2021, Sustainability (Switzerland)\n\n\nChallenges and opportunities associated with waste management in India\n2017, Royal Society Open Science\n\n\nMunicipal solid waste and the environment: A global perspective\n2012, Annual Review of Environment and Resources\n\n\nEnvironmental literacy in science and society: From knowledge to decisions\n2011, Environmental Literacy in Science and Society: From Knowledge to Decisions\n\n\nDevelopment drivers for waste management\n2007, Waste Management and Research\n\n\nView all citing articles on Scopus\nView full text\nCopyright © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

      "raw_content": "This factsheet has first been published in September 2020 and is being updated in 2023 as part of the efforts of PREVENT Waste Alliance Plastic Working Group on Social Inclusion. This is a preliminary version of the updated factsheet. This factsheet describes how informal workers and enterprises can be integrated into waste collection, sorting and recycling systems for packaging as part of the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) concept and related municipal waste management initiatives without leaving aside workers under vulnerable working conditions in formal waste management markets. It explores, among others, the following questions: Which forms of organisation (e.g. cooperatives) are suitable and which role can they play for the integration of informal workers? How can working conditions and income of informal waste pickers be improved and sustainable business models be set up? How can access to healthcare and social services be improved? This is analysed with a \"Just Transition\" perspective recently stressed by waste picker organisations, seeking to ensure that “nobody is left behind.\" Two case studies are briefly mentioned at the end of this factsheet, complemented by other key readings and sources In low- and middle-income countries, separate collection, sorting and recycling of specific types of packaging waste is often carried out by the informal economy, sometimes in parallel to the official waste management system. The activities of the informal sector are driven by a combination of the market value of certain recyclable materials and the socio-economic conditions affecting some sections of the population. Over time, some form of informal waste management system covering the collection, sale and, to a more limited extent, the processing of recyclable materials has developed in virtually every city in the world. For the purposes of this factsheet, the term ‘informal worker’ refers to workers with no legal employment contracts, work/operating permits, access to health care or entitlements to social security, as well as those working in conditions that do not comply with health and safety and/or environmental standards. Factsheet 08 | Just Transition and recognition of the informal sector Factsheet 08: Just Transition and recognition of the informal sector page 2 The need of a Just Transition The definition of “Just Transition”1 used in the context of plastic pollution was developed by representatives of waste pickers’ movements from around the world and draws on the ILO definition frequently referred to in the context of climate action, and the definition proposed by the International Trade Union Congress in their submissions to the Secretariat. Just Transition is defined as ending plastic pollution in a way that is as fair and inclusive as possible to everyone concerned, creating decent work opportunities and leaving no one behind. It is based on making visible those already working at all stages of the plastic value chain, waste pickers and other workers under informal and cooperative settings and recognising their fundamental human dignity, and their historic contribution. It involves maximising the social and economic opportunities of ending plastic pollution while minimising and carefully managing any challenges – including through effective social dialogue among all groups impacted, and respect for fundamental human rights. A plan for a just transition must build and improve upon systems that waste pickers have already established while guaranteeing, better and decent work, social protection, more training opportunities, appropriate technology transfer, support for infrastructure and organising of workers, and greater job security for workers at all stages of the plastic value chain, waste-pickers and other workers in informal and cooperative settings, and all workers affected by plastic pollution. Its specific outworking will depend on local context and local consultation. The just transition framework should emphasise supporting waste pickers and other workers who are most vulnerable to occupational disruption from waste management investments and climate change. A description of the informal sector The waste management sector is labour-intensive, and the initial investment required to set up a business is low. Barriers to entry are perceived to be low, which is one reason why the industry is particularly attractive to people working informally to boost their incomes. In some parts of the world, all waste management work is done on an informal basis, and such informal systems are very often the backbone of collection, separation, recycling and trade in low- and middle-income countries. It is difficult to describe the informal sector in general terms, as circumstances vary markedly between countries and are strongly influenced by specific local factors, such as seasonal fluctuations in the industry. In some parts of the world, such as in some regions of Brazil, the informal sector is highly organised and efficient, and provides a good living for the people who work in it. In contrast, in other countries informal workers in the waste industry earn barely more than $2 a day.2 Contamination of waste due to a lack of separation at source drives down the market value of waste collected, and end-consumer markets for the goods are often underdeveloped, too. Moreover, many governments and societies barely recognise the informal sector and the important contribution it makes to public and environmental health, leading to low social status and a lack of support for efforts to improve living and working conditions. Informal stakeholders operate at every step in the waste management chain, though they 1 International Alliance of Waste Pickers (2023).

Drawing clear boundaries as to where informal activity comes to an end and formal work begins is generally extremely difficult (see Figure 1).3 Many informal stakeholders in waste management systems collect recyclables from households or workplaces as waste pickers on the streets, at transfer stations and at dumpsites. They usually collect recyclable materials and sell them to middlemen– small businesses which store recyclables before selling them on to recycling companies. However, informal businesses operate at every stage of the recycling process, in some cases through direct commercial links between waste pickers and formal recycling companies. Depending on the roles people fulfil along informal packaging waste value chains, their working lives are often characterised by a lack of regular income, rudimentary equipment and harsh working conditions, little or no recognition of their work and a generally vulnerable position in the labour market. As the nature of the informal sector varies between countries, it is difficult to define general categories of workers within the informal waste management sector, but most systems incorporate at least some of the following groups:4 ● Recyclables collectors are self-employed workers who use bags, small push-carts, pull carts or small motorised vehicles to collect recyclable materials bought from households, generators of bulk waste or other establishments. They sell the material they collect to junk shops as a primary source of income and/or directly to formal recycling facilities ● Material pickers pick up recyclable waste material on the streets or at landfill sites, rather than collecting it directly from the source. Picking waste material is very labour-intensive and dangerous, particularly on landfill sites, and landfill picking is illegal in many countries. ● Professional and semi-professional informal companies are usually well-equipped (perhaps with a motorcycle and trailer for collecting waste), highly knowledgeable about the industry and the waste cycle, and often take genuine pride in their work. These companies act as informal middlemen who buy and sell packaging waste, and/or process it using certain recycling processes (see also Figure 1). ● Casual or precarious informal workers are often elderly people or people experiencing temporary hardship (for example, as a result of unemployment). They usually have simple equipment such as old prams or wheelbarrows. ● Women waste pickers are treated as a specific category of informal workers because their work is particularly precarious, and they are often equipped with nothing more than a pram, if they have any tools at all. They often must fend for themselves, as they can’t count on support from other family members, and have little prospect of developing any sort of career. Collection of packaging by the informal sector Before the informal sector can be integrated into an EPR system, a thorough analysis is required to determine exactly which waste fractions are already being collected. Generally speaking, informal waste collectors tend to collect any packaging and/or material with a positive market value (i.e. material that can generate income when sold). Collection by the informal sector also varies depending on the proximity of recycling facilities or other potential customers to whom the waste 3 Kenya Plastic Action Plan (2019) 4 Triangulated from - GA Circular (2020).

Inclusive Recycling in North Africa and Middle East. Factsheet 08: Just Transition and recognition of the informal sector page 4 can be sold (e.g. waste banks, aggregators or brokers). If a specific price is paid for a given type of packaging (see table below), it is safe to assume that informal collectors will collect a considerable part of it. The following table shows an example of which types of packaging and materials are collected in the informal sector. This greatly varies from location to location. Table 1: How various types of household waste are collected in the informal sector Packaging type and material Collected in the informal sector Comments PET bottles Often Usually have a positive market value, easy to collect, recycling/recovery systems often already established. Packaging containing ferrous metals (like cans) Often Positive market value, with most waste being generated in industrial settings. Local recycling facilities usually in place. Non-ferrous metal packaging (like cans) Often Positive market value, with most waste being generated in industrial settings. Can usually be recycled or marketed locally. Paper Often Paper waste is collected primarily from industrial/commercial sources. Can usually be recycled or marketed locally. HDPE (rigid plastics, such as bottles) Sometimes Sometimes carries a positive net market value depending on local recycling facilities. PP/PS (rigid plastics, such as cups) Sometimes Sometimes carries a positive net market value depending on local recycling facilities. LDPE (film) Sometimes There is sometimes a positive market value for mono-materials, though this market value is generally for industrial waste only and depends on local recycling facilities. Glass Sometimes Market value strongly dependent on local recycling facilities and usually more stable than other commodities. Collection is labour-intensive because glass is a dense material and heavy to carry. Liquid packaging board (TetraPak and similar) Rarely No positive market value as it is generally difficult to market and recycle locally. Collection can be incentivised if the producer pays for it to be collected (thus creating an artificial market). PS Not collected Accounts for only a small proportion of household packaging waste, making collection labour-intensive and non-profitable. Other PET packaging (e.g. trays) Not collected No positive market value, no established recycling process. PVC Not collected Accounts for only a small proportion of household packaging waste, making collection labour-intensive and non-profitable. There are facilities in place for the collection and recycling of some non-packaging items, such as PVC pipes. Composites (flexible and rigid) and other plastics Not collected No market value. Collection is labour-intensive (especially for flexible packaging) because it is light, meaning that very large quanties have to be collected to make collection viable. Factsheet 08: Just Transition and recognition of the informal sector page 5 The need for sustainable waste management In high-income countries, the proportion of waste collected for recycling is rising in line with increasing GDP. However, studies indicate that this is not the case in many low- and middle-income countries. For PET bottles, for instance, data show that countries with lower GDPs generally have higher collected-for-recycling rates than countries with higher GDPs. One of the main reasons for this inverse correlation is reliance on the informal sector. As countries and cities develop, the average cost of living increases, and collecting and selling PET bottles in the informal sector ceases to be economically viable, forcing workers to move on to other trades and jobs. This in turn leads to a reduction in the number of workers in the informal waste management sector, which pushes down the collected-for-recycling rate. Unless this cycle is addressed, it can pose a real problem for the transition to sustainable waste management.5 Improving waste management and recycling is a crucial step for the development of low- and middle-income countries, and the expertise of stakeholders in the informal waste management sector will be key to achieving this aim, so it is very important that they are socially and economically integrated into the waste management industry. However, informal operators can only carry out waste management activities when the following conditions are met: ● Materials are easy to access. ● Transport and, if necessary, storage, are easy to arrange. ● There is a market for the materials they collect. ● There are buyers in their local areas. ● Collecting the materials can be expected to generate revenue. Collecting waste in the informal, as opposed to the formal, economy, brings a high level of risk and uncertainty for those involved in collection, and severely limits the scope to establish a sustainable waste management system. In informal systems, items with no market value are not collected and continue to litter the environment; systems that concentrate on collecting marketable materials are not effective for disposing other types of waste. Therefore, a key requirement for a comprehensive waste collection system is to shift the focus from collecting materials with a positive market value to providing a service to the population, regardless of how much the waste is worth in financial terms. EPR is one of the key tools for this shift to a service-orientated mindset. It needs to be accompanied by efforts to recognise and integrate workers in the informal sector into a formal, supervised waste management system, possibly including moves to formalise their work. To make sure the system is properly funded for the long-term, it is also important to measure and be aware of the management costs for all waste materials, including items that have no positive market value. Integrating the informal sector into an EPR system When an EPR works effectively, it encourages solid, long-term organisational structures and reliable funding. This in turn brings major benefits for workers and businesses working alongside it in the informal sector. Any good EPR system must be able to do the following: ● Ensure nationwide collection of all packaging. ● Develop infrastructure for sorting and recycling packaging. ● Material recycling and high-quality recovery. ● Dispose of any non-recoverable packaging in an environmentally sound manner. ● Document and monitor waste management activity. ● Fulfil the obligations assigned to it by market participants. ● Provide training, advice and information. 5 GA Circular (2020). Full Circle. Accelerating the Circular Economy for Post-Consumer PET Bottles in Southeast Asia Factsheet 08: Just Transition and recognition of the informal sector page 6 ● Ensure materials can be easily identified. ● Ensure high standards of safety and welfare for workers in the EPR system. ● Make sure the management of financial flows is transparent and those responsible for doing so are held accountable. Before the informal sector can be integrated into an EPR system, a thorough analysis is required to: ● Find the best term to refer to informal workers that makes them feel comfortable and proud, ● Identify organised communities with leaders who can represent them (they can be mostly independent and hence not easy to identify), ● Know whether they are already supported by NGOs which can collaborate as intermediaries to facilitate any communication and preparation process regarding EPR integration, ● Identify existing studies or surveys carried out by environmental agencies, NGOs or other stakeholders trying to identify and characterise workers in the informal waste sector, ● Identify existing or ongoing work to establish policies for the inclusion of the informal waste workers, ● Identify existing initiatives to register informal waste workers, ● Identify existing initiatives led by packaging producers to integrate informal workers in packaging waste collection and sorting processes, ● Do what is necessary to get a formal agreement between all stakeholders related with the packaging value chain recognising informal workers as key players for the EPR implementation process. According to Morais et al. (2022)6, the formalisation of informal economies can take different approaches, such as registration, taxation, organisation and representation, legal frameworks, social protection, business incentives or support, and more. For the waste picker community, the following benefits would be included as outlined in table 2 below. Table 2: Waste pickers formalisation approaches7 Legal recognition Improve salary conditions and benefits Improve representation Access to training and personal protective equipment Legal recognition and positive public image and or public acceptance by waste pickers who contribute to the upkeep and cleanliness of the cities they work in. Increased earnings of workers via stable monthly income. Increase their voice and representation. Improve their skills through training. Identification cards to protect them, so that they can be identified as workers in order to benefit from the payment scheme Improve work conditions e.g. uniforms, specially designed carts and buckets for collection of MSW and sorting spaces, etc. Bargaining mechanisms to negotiate with buyers of the material they collect and with municipal officials. Access to appropriate equipment and protective gear such as carts and gloves. 6 Morais (2022). Global review of human waste-picking and its contribution to poverty alleviation and a circular economy. 7 According to Morais et al. (2022), based on Dias 2016, International Labour Organisation and WIEGO 2017, WIEGO 2020. Factsheet 08: Just Transition and recognition of the informal sector page 7 Access to welfare e.g. day-care for children, education scholarships, pension schemes. Organisational and bargaining power will help self and social recognition of their workers as a prerequisite toward building a collective voice and self-representation in order to engage in negotiations with employers, suppliers, buyers and or middlemen. Due to the lack of an existing exemplary inclusive EPR model, WIEGO created an overview of enabling factors that are based on the experience of waste pickers and a few systems attempting integration. Below is a summary based on WIEGO (2022)8. Legislative Action for mainstreaming of the informal economy: ● Recognise all actors in the informal recycling economy, in regulatory and legislative frameworks around waste management and resource recovery as applicable in individual countries. ● EPR systems need to account for waste pickers and other informal waste workers in EPR systems so that EPR functions well without exacerbating exclusion and poverty. ● EPR system design must be multi-stakeholder, and needs ongoing, direct communication with informal waste workers in the recycling value chain – waste pickers, waste pickers’ organisations, scrap dealers, aggregators and recyclers. ● The regulatory framework must also allow for a just transition to the formal economy, without discrimination, irrespective of the worker or entrepreneur status – such as the provision of occupational identity cards, ease of registration including reduced fee involved in registration, allowing participation in tenders and bids and upholding existing service contracts and ensuring that EPR systems do not exclude informal workers, and upholding existing service contracts and ensuring that EPR systems do not exclude informal workers. ● Strong markets for materials are key to both promoting a circular economy as well as ensuring an inclusive recycling, reuse and repair sector that generates and sustains local livelihoods. Facilitative Action to create an enabling environment: ● Access to capacity development and training ● Access to social security ● Access to infrastructure, land and equipment ● Access to finance ● Access to legal support and administration ● Access to technology Governance Action for ensuring adequate waste management, employment targets and standards, and social and labour protections: ● Protect access to waste for the informal waste workers ● Prevent monopoly power and greenwashing 8 WIEGO (2022). Technical Brief on Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) and Waste Pickers. Factsheet 08: Just Transition and recognition of the informal sector page 8 ● Support entrepreneurship and social business ● Support fair pricing of material that is negotiated between all stakeholders ● Provide grievance redressal mechanisms ● Prevent corrupt/exclusionary practices ● Prevent monopoly power by producers ● Enforce the Polluter Pays Principle ● Promote equal partnerships ● Manage data traceability from producer organisations (PRO), by ensuring data is in the public domain Integrating informal workers through waste picker cooperatives or as employees ‘Typical’ waste pickers work in the streets, on dumpsites and at landfill sites. Their main focus is gathering valuable materials according to the principle of ‘cash for trash’: anything that cannot be sold for a profit is left to pollute the environment. However, an EPR system has to ensure that all packaging is collected, including packaging with no market value or waste that is too light or difficult to collect to be economically viable (e.g. plastic bags, sachets, composite packaging). Labour-intensive collection and sorting represent a great opportunity to integrate informal waste pickers into an EPR. The system operator (PRO) can help by offering attractive, formalised, terms and conditions, thus encouraging collectors who have been working informally to join a waste pickers’ cooperative or apply for jobs. Agreements between cooperatives and PROs or employment contracts can be made directly between the waste picker and the PRO, or between waste pickers cooperative or the employee and a company tasked with providing sorting and collection services to the PRO. Photo 1: Sorting PET bottles in Accra, Ghana (© cyclos 2019) In order to formalise the current position of workers in the informal sector and integrate them into an EPR system, setting up co-operatives can help to formalise their activities9 . Formalisation is often linked to restricting workers to set working hours. This can cause problems for some informal workers, especially women. With this in mind, it is important that moves to integrate informal workers should leave room for flexible solutions. The four key steps in the formalisation process are: ● Building trust and making sure workers are aware of how the system works and what will be expected of them. ● Providing professional training and legal advice. ● Providing access to waste management infrastructure and equipments ● Signing formal agreements (cooperatives) or employment contracts. 9 Morais (2022). Global review of human waste-picking and its contribution to poverty alleviation and a circular economy. Factsheet 08: Just Transition and recognition of the informal sector page 9 The table below demonstrates the potential benefits and disadvantages that come with integrating informal workers into the formal economy: Table 3: Benefits of integrating informal workers into the formal economy Informal sector Formal agreements with cooperatives or employment Irregular income Earning regular income and paying tax Lack of appropriate waste management infrastructure and equipment Access to suitable infrastructure and equipment Insecure living standards Better living standards High risk of ill health Lower risk of ill health Vulnerable to unfair business practices Fair, regulated business practices Lack of access to social security systems Access to social security systems Very high degree of flexibility and independence Less flexibility and independence Cooperatives, in particular, have proven especially effective in integrating informal workers across a number of countries. Under this model, formally registered collectives and cooperatives of independent informal workers enter into formal agreements to manage waste on behalf of the local authorities on a contracted basis. Allowing waste pickers in cooperatives to participate in such activities enables them to influence decision-making and to operate from a position of strength in numbers. Organising informal workers as part of a formal system requires a high level of trust between all those involved. Integrating informal workers as business partners of independent/self-employed entrepreneurs Professional and semi-professional waste management companies in the informal sector are generally very well informed about the market, recycling, recovery options, the key stakeholders within the recycling chain and the various processes associated with waste management. The skills of these informal companies can be invaluable when it comes to setting up a successful EPR system, and the system operator (PRO) should consider contracts with some of these companies. Alternatively, if the aim is to integrate these informal actors into the system via a formal contract, the PRO and any co-contractors may agree to make companies in the informal sector formal members of the EPR scheme. Where informal companies own their own facilities, it must be ascertained exactly what services they provide and what standards they comply with (or will be expected to comply with in the future). If these companies operate their own collection vehicles, it should be established whether they are roadworthy and how much waste they can transport. If, on the other hand, the companies have been operating purely as trading companies (perhaps with their own storage facilities), discussions should be held to clarify how they can contribute to the EPR system. Independent/self-employed entrepreneurs may be able to play a role in areas including collection services, the provision of storage capacity, and sorting, marketing and/or recycling waste. Factsheet 08: Just Transition and recognition of the informal sector page 10 Photo 2: Waste delivery in Accra, Ghana (© cyclos 2019) In order to include companies operating informally in an EPR system, their status has to be formalised. The first step in this process is getting the company to register with the system operator (PRO) and provide clear identifying information, including its address, a specific location, a nominated point of contact, an e-mail address and a detailed description of the services it provides. Other key steps include: ● Building trust, as well as providing information on the system and the types of services required. ● Providing professional supervision and legal advice. ● Concluding service agreements with business partners. The table below illustrates the effects of involving participants (both individuals and companies) from the informal sector in recycling systems as formal business partners: Table 4: Involving informal business as formal business partners. Informal business Formal business partners Uncertain commercial basis for operations Fixed service agreements Uncertain marketing conditions Reliable acceptance of recyclables Uncertain situation for employees/workers Better conditions for employees/workers High operational risks Reduced risks Vulnerable to unfair business practices Supervised business practices Not paying tax (though they may be paying informal landlords or stakeholders in order to operate) Paying tax No obligations to report to public authorities Required to report to public authorities (which they may find very time-consuming and cumbersome) No obligation to provide access to healthcare and welfare benefits for workers/employees Expected to provide access to healthcare and welfare benefits to individual workers/employees Enterprises in the informal sector can be integrated into EPR systems as formal partners by a number of different routes. For example, they can be set up as NGO-supported micro enterprises, as franchises of formal waste management companies, as community-based organisations, or as associations, among others, depending on the local jurisdiction.10 10 Ocean Conservancy (2019). Plastics Policy Playbook Factsheet 08: Just Transition and recognition of the informal sector page 11 Other lessons learned from integrating informal enterprises and formalising working conditions Past experience with integrating informal enterprises into formal structures has highlighted a number of useful lessons.11 However, it is also important to take account of context-specific challenges that may arise when implementing and scaling up projects. ● Public authorities (both at national and local level) are crucial in supporting the integration of informal workers by providing social security and implementing waste-related legislation (including legislation not connected to EPR). ● Children often work as waste pickers in order to contribute to the family income or to support themselves independently, sacrificing their education, health and physical development. When addressing the issue of child labour, it is important to acknowledge the economic issues to which it is intimately connected, and to address the contextual and structural factors that influence children to work or prevent them from accessing education. ● Inclusion and empowerment of women should be prioritised. Women are still frequently excluded from formal labour as it is often still perceived as a male domain12. ● An effort should be made to raise public awareness of the work done by informal waste management workers and why it is important. Integrating informal stakeholders into the legal framework of an EPR System Informal recycling activities should be integrated into the EPR system in order to ensure the people involved in them are working as part of the EPR system and to remove any risk to their incomes. With this in mind, their work should be carried out on the basis of the legal framework applicable to the mandatory EPR system concerned. In particular, the legal basis should outline how the informal sector can be involved in the EPR system, and what responsibilities the PRO shall assume in this regard. Below follow two examples on how some countries already incorporated the inclusion of informal workers in their practices on EPR for packaging. Chile case study In Chile, a legal framework for a mandatory EPR system has already been drawn up. The decree covering packaging was enacted in June 2020 where it is stipulated that producers must begin compliance with a gradual scheme of recycling targets starting from October 2023 through PROs to which they must necessarily adhere. Article 41 of this decree states that: The waste pickers who are registered in the national register (RETC or PRTR) will be able to participate in waste management in order to achieve the objectives established in the Decree. For these purposes, they must be certified within the framework of the National System of Certification of Labour Competencies established in Law No. 20 267. The Producer Responsibility Organisation must make the bidding rules under which they will conclude contracts for the collection and recovery services available to the waste pickers free of charge. In addition, the PRO’s Inclusion Plan (Article 41) must indicate the mechanisms and instruments of training, financing and formalisation, aimed at enabling the full integration of waste pickers, indicating the scope and magnitude of the efforts to be made in these three aspects […].13 11 After Manning, C. (2020). Private sector partnerships with waste pickers 12 UNEP (2015). Global Waste Management Outlook. 13 Chilean packaging EPR decree (Spanish): https://www.bcn.cl/leychile/navegar?idNorma=1157019 Factsheet 08: Just Transition and recognition of the informal sector page 12 South Africa Case Study14 In South Africa, the absence of formal systems for separation at source of recyclables, an informal sector comprised of waste pickers has emerged that contributes significantly to the collection of recyclables. These informal sector livelihoods are marginal, with many waste pickers being homeless or living in informal settlements, and in many cases living on or adjacent to landfills15. The National Waste Management Strategy 202016 promotes waste separation at source linked to EPR programmes including waste pickers. It calls for innovation and a variety of different models and tools to be developed for engaging the informal sector (waste pickers) that accomplish waste separation at source. The promulgation of EPR regulations in November 202017 provided the legal framework for waste picker integration into the post-consumer collection value chain and for EPR schemes to pay a living wage (not below the minimum wage) to waste collectors, reclaimers, and pickers. Progress to date includes the development of the Guidelines for Waste Picker Integration18, the associated supporting website hosting a variety of useful resources and training materials (www.wastepickerintegration.org) as well as the development of the South Africa Waste Picker Registration System (SAWPRS). Registration on the SAWPRS will facilitate waste pickers’ inclusion in government and industry programmes and provide pickers with access to the service fee which industry must pay to them in terms of the EPR regulations19. It is important to note that although payments of waste pickers were to have commenced in November 2022, significant work must still be conducted by Producer Responsibility Organisations (PROs) to ensure that all registered waste pickers are paid the service fee.
