The country, bordered by Colombia, Ecuador, Brazil, Bolivia and Chile, is rich in natural resources such as copper, silver, lead, zinc, oil and gold. Peru’s economic development has in large part been driven by this abundance and by the high commodity prices on the global market (MVO Nederland, 2017). The capital (and main) city Lima is home to 10 million out of the 31.8 million Peruvians. The city is divided into 43 districts, which all have full autonomy regarding waste management.\n1. The Waste/CE Market Analysis 1.1 Facts & Figures Waste Generation and Composition In 2018, Peru produced 7.3 million tons of Municipal Waste, or 0.63 kilograms per person per day. 57.7% was organic waste; 18.3% recyclables such as plastic, aluminum and paper; and 24.1% was residual wasteix. Of the 20,000 tons of garbage produced daily, a third is generated in Lima. According to official data, only 1% of the municipal waste is being valorized; 4% of the dry recyclable waste and 1% of organicsx. Information is scarce and mostly limited to the formal sector, even though the informal sector recycles more than the formal sector. Additionally, 28.9 million tons of non-Municipal Waste per year is generated, 59.5% of which comes from industry, 16.1% from agriculture and 9.5% from mining (National Environmental Action Plan 2011-2021 PLANAA). 1.2 Collection and Disposal 1.2.1 Waste Collection Peru has a Municipal Solid Waste collection coverage of 93.7%. However, in 80% of the municipalities the waste ends up at dumpsites (PLANAA). Only 6.4% of the districts (119 out of the 1874) dispose of their solid waste at controlled landfills. However, these 119 districts are important in terms of volume. 49.2% of the total amount of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is generated there. Officially, almost 15% of the municipalities practice open air burning of the waste, but in practice most of the municipalities have an illegal dumpsite, since it is cheaper. In some medium-sized cities other private companies collect and transport the waste to the landfill, such as the French companies Seche and Veolia and the Colombian company Interaseo. Companies interested in offering waste management services must be officially registered at the Ministry of Environment (MINAM). The list of companies can be found here. 1.2.2 Waste Disposal All in all, the country has 52 landfills (four of which in Lima) and 1,585 dumpsites. 98% of the dumpsites should be closed while 2% could be converted into official landfillsxi. Because of their extensive knowledge, Dutch consultancy and equipment producer companies can play an important role in this process. Key Indicators Size Peru is 31 times larger than the Netherlands Population (2019) 33.2 millioni Nominal GDP (2019) USD 230.7 Billion world rank: 50thii GDP per capita (2019) USD 13,416iii Import from the NL (2018) USD 49 millioniv Economic growth (2018) 4%v Ease of doing business rank (2019) 76/190vi Corruption index (2019) 101/180vii Unemployment rate (2019) 6.6%viii Currency Sol (S) Time difference NL -6/-7 hours 2 In Lima, the collection of 9000 ton of municipality domestic waste is carried out daily by six private companies. Innova and Petramas operate both two of the four landfills. The municipalities are the owners of the landfills and determine which company gets to operate them. The tipping fee for waste companies is approximately € 3.95/ton. Hospital waste is disposed in the landfill, at a separate location, but without further measures. Lima has two small incinerators for hospital waste. 1.3 Value Chain 1.3.1 Recycling In Peru, there are more than 98,000 informal waste pickers, and only 1,800 formal onesxii. As a result of the “Waste Pickers Law” (Law No. 29419), local governments primarily focus on informal waste pickers in their recycling plans. As a result, most of the organizations are (in)formal small companies, which makes it rather difficult for Dutch companies to find business opportunities in the collection of municipal recyclable waste. The separation of organic and inorganic waste is underdeveloped and, in most cases, does not take place at all (MVO Nederland, 2017). As a result, the national government implemented a strategy on source separation with the local governments (PLANAA). If the municipalities comply with their goals, they receive money from the Ministry of Economics and Finance (MEF), as established in the Decree Nº 362-2019-EFxiii. The implementation of selective collection systems can offer opportunities for Dutch equipment producers, but as well for organisations that specialize in data management. When it comes to special waste streams, the country has taken first important steps. For example, Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)-legislation for E-waste was implemented in 2012, then updated in 2019xiv. This legislation establishes that 50% of used electronics has to be treated and recycled adequately in 2017, rising to 100% in 2021. In addition, in May 2013 the National Superintendency of State Assets has approved a national directive for the adequate discharge and treatment of E-waste of public entities. This is around 30% of the total E-wastexv. Although the national government has regulated E-waste, in most cities the E-waste is still dumped along with domestic solid waste, or delivered to one of the three national recycling plants, located in Lima (PLANAA). Control and enforcement are weak, among others because of lack of human resources. In October 2020, MINAM presented a draft version of EPR-legislation on tiresxvi. A final version is expected soon. This legislation will open new markets for Dutch companies in tire recycling. In the third year after approval of the law there will be a 15% recycling target. The Peruvian government is also working on EPR- legislation for batteries. This legislation is expected to be presented by the end of 2020 or beginning 2021. As for packaging waste, the country decided to first gather information on how much packaging waste is being produced and by whom before implementing this EPR-legislation. The Netherlands, being one of the first country that implemented this legislation, could take a proactive role in defining the framework, data gathering and supporting packaging producers. An inspiring example of Peruvian-Dutch cooperation in plastics recycling is already in full swing. Banana plantations in Peru use plastic bags to protect the bananas from bugs and enhance fruit growth. These bags tend to end up in the environment after use. The Dutch banana supplier Agrofair, the consultancy company WASTE and the technology provider Plastic Fantastic have teamed up to develop corner boards out of recycled plastics to protect the banana pellets during shipment. The first recycling line has now been placed at one of AgroFair’s banana suppliers. The corner boards are being produced, saving a lot of virgin plastic. In Peru, the management of construction and demolition waste (C&D waste) is regulated since 2013xvii. The Ministry of Housing obliges producers to present a waste management plan annually, which includes among others amount of waste produced, a strategy on classification, separate collection and final disposal and education campaigns. However, to date the country does not have any Construction & Demolition waste recycling facility. As a result, Construction & Demolition waste ends up in landfills or is dumped illegally, for example at designated beaches. In October 2020, the Ministry of Housing presented a new lawxviii to incentivize the valorization of Construction & Demolition waste and the use of recycled building materials. The design of this law 3 and the demand for (recycling) infrastructure offer promising business opportunities for Dutch companies. 1.3.2 Composting Agri-food is one of the biggest economic activities in Peru and also one of the largest exporting sectors, especially to the Netherlands. According to MVO Nederland (2017), for many Dutch (start-up) companies it is of great interest to invest in the valorization of agri-food residue streams in Peru, both from an economic and an environmental perspective. As an example, experts from Wageningen UR and TNO are already looking for opportunities to apply their expertise in Peru. Last year, the Dutch Agricultural Counsellorxix participated with several Dutch companies in the biggest Latin American Poultry Congress. Among other options they presented solutions for the valorization of organic waste. On the other hand, the national governmentxx obliges municipalities to properly treat and use their organic waste. The compost must be used to improve the soil of municipal parks and gardensxxi. Sectoral experts indicate that Peruvian companies are looking for solutions to process fruit, vegetables, fish and seafood for composting and animal feed. 1.3.3 Waste to Energy Waste to Energy has been applied in Peru in a sense that the company Petramas installed a power plant at the Huaycoloro landfill site near Lima (Worldbank, 2012). The grid connected system converted methane of the landfill into 4 Mega Watts of clean electricity, enough to power 9,000 homes. This project was carried out under the Netherlands Clean Development Mechanism Facility. The carbon credits helped to sustain the project. A similar project was carried out at the former waste dump known as La Cucaracha in the Municipality of Callao. The Ohio based company Eco Waste Solutions installed a Waste to Energy batch system facility for a mining community of 1,600 in the Alto Chicama region of Peru. 2 tons of solid waste and 250 l of liquids per day are being processed in parallel through a pyrolysis process. To date there is no large-scale waste incineration facility in Peru, although Lima appears to have the appropriate size for it. The Peruvian Government has not yet developed a strategy to implement this. 2. Governance on Waste/CE 2.1 Waste Management The Ministry of Environment (MINAM), created in 2008, is responsible for the National Solid Waste policy. It has designed and implemented the national solid waste management plan (PLANRES) and supports the provincial (PIGARS) and district (PMRS) solid waste management plans. The PIGARS 2015-2025xxii of the Municipality of Lima is the most important local plan. The National Environmental Plan 2011-2021 (PLANAA) of MINAM includes specific guidelines on waste management and a special chapter on promoting public and private investment in the sector. The PLANAA specifies the following goals for 2021: • 100% of the non-recyclable waste is treated and disposed of adequately • 100% of reusable solid waste is recycled • Compared to 2012, the generation of hazardous waste is reduced by 20% • 100% of hazardous waste is treated properly and disposed of in appropriate facilities It is clear that these goals will not be met by 2021, but no doubt it is important and useful to aim high. The PLANRESxxiii 2016-2024 was developed by the government, in partnership with the United Nations and 800 stakeholders from the public, private and civil society sectors representing a total of 271 institutions in Peru. The Ministry of Production (PRODUCE) formulates, executes and supervises the national and sectoral Industrial policiesxxiv. In the field of waste management, the Ministry works together with MINAM in the supervision and control of the EPR framework and the management of several funds. Decree nº 1278, published in December 2016, regulates the Law on the Integrated Management of Solid Waste and lays the foundation for the transition towards a circular economy. In May 2020, this law was updated. The new version nº 1501xxv facilitates the reactivation of the economy after the pandemic. It contains several important changesxxvi which make it easier for companies to recycle their solid waste. The obligation 4 that the waste must be collected and transported by official service providers was skipped. Companies now can deliver their waste to formal recyclers' associations. Besides, the new law includes less strict requirements for waste collection centers and allows companies to valorize their organic waste (<2tons per day) without a license. The latter change can make it easier for Dutch companies to offer their small scale and mobile equipment. In addition, the Decree1278 makes it possible to exchange C&D waste between construction projects without a license. In December 2018, Law nº 30884 was approved. This law regulates the use of single use plastics as well as plastic packaging. It introduces the obligation for producers to use at least 15% postconsumer recycled material in PET bottles starting 2022. It also defines incentives for replacing single use plastic bags by reusable onesxxvii. In Peru, the different ministries are responsible for the waste that is generated in their sector. The Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) plays an important role in financing the different waste programs designed by MINAM., in 2018 220 million USD in incentives were given. 2.2 Policy Landscape: Circular Economy The National Competitiveness and Productivity Plan 2019 – 2030xxviii includes the objective to “generate the conditions for the transition towards a circular and eco-efficient economy”. As a follow-up to this, MEF is preparing two so called roadmaps: one for the industrial sectors and another one with guidelines for fishing and agriculture. At the end of 2018, the National Society of Industries (SNI) launched a Circular Economy Commission. The main objective was to find out how the Peruvian industries are going to make the shift towards circular economy models. The Commission consists of Coca Cola Peru, Pamolsa, Owen Illinois Peru, Nestlé Peru, OPP Film, the Cooperation of Plastic industries and Tetra Pak Peruxxix. The SNI worked together with MINAM and PRODUCE to prepare the Circular Economy Roadmap for the Industry. This Roadmap was approved and presented by the national government in February 2020xxx. Currently, the government is developing the Roadmap for the fishing and agriculture sectors (due by the end of this year). In January 2019 Peru signed the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment, promoted by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. 3. Financial Aspects In Peru, citizens pay their fee for collection and final disposal directly to the municipality as part of the municipal tax. This appears to be a good arrangement but in practice, only 18% of residents pay for waste management (MVO, 2017). The new waste management law allows municipalities to charge the waste tax through the electricity or water bill. Various funds can be used to implement waste management projects: • National Environment Fund – FONAM • National Fund for Science and Technology – FINCYT • Fund for the Promotion of Regional and Local Public Investment - FIDT • The National Program of Innovation for Competitiveness and Productivity: Innóvate Perú. Additionally, companies can use their income taxes to invest in infrastructure projectsxxxi. 4. Stakeholders As presented in the report, the private sector in Peru plays an important role in the transition towards a circular economy. Many companies have been involved in the design of the national waste management policy and the roadmaps. In many cases the Government expects the private sector to play an active and risk-taking role in the development of infrastructure for waste management projects through Public Private Partnerships (PPP’s). For Dutch companies this means that by default they will have to work with and through Peruvian partner companies, as they are not likely to enter as investment partners themselves. Peru has the following important private associations: • National Society of Industries • Foreign trade society: ComexPerú 5 • National Quality Institute Like many Latin American countries, Peru has an NGO created by multinational companies to finance the implementation of recycling projects. In Peru, this organization is called Reciclame. Overall, companies in the beverage sector such as Coca Cola and Arca Continental Lindley are taking a frontrunners role by implementing waste management and circular economy projectsxxxii. These companies also tend to be member of one or multiple committees of the national society of industries or one of the chambers of commerce. 5. Dutch–Peruvian Cooperation Verstappen Environmental Consultancy and five subcontractors from the Netherlands and Peru (private sector and NGO's) are executing the study “Solid Waste Management Peru, Lima and Piura”. The main activities include waste characterizations, optimization of existing landfills and methane extraction, design of new landfills, rehabilitation of illegal dumpsites and organizing the involvement of the informal recycling sector. The project takes place between 2019 and 2021 and is carried out in close cooperation with the Netherlands Embassy and RVO. Bart van Hoof of the University los Andes in Bogotá is helping the Peruvian government with the design of the national circular economy strategy. 6. Business Opportunities After their study in Cusco in 2017, MVO Nederland concluded that in Peru there is the will to work on the waste issue, but the challenges are as yet numerous. These include a lack of technical know-how and hardware, an absence of efficient logistics and limited resources of local governments to tackle the challenges at hand (in terms of budget as well as human resources). As a result, the following business opportunities were singled out. 6.1 Sustainable landfilling Most of the waste in the country is still deposited in dumpsites and only a small fraction of municipality waste is valorized. The process of closing illegal dumpsites and designing and implementing of landfills that meet official requirements is part of the Dutch waste management history. Hopefully, the ongoing study of Verstappen Environmental Consultancy will shed additional light on specific opportunities for Dutch companies concerning the sustainable management of landfilling. 6.2 Processing of Organic Waste The scope and importance of the agriculture sector makes the valorization of agri-food residue streams in Peru an interesting market for Dutch companies. Dutch companies no doubt can contribute useful know-how and infrastructure for efficient organic waste management, for municipal as well as the industrial sector. Promising areas include small-scale and mobile equipment for the processing of organic waste, for example of municipal marketplaces. 6.3 Tire recycling and C&D waste In Peru, the management of special waste streams is not fully developed yet. Dutch consultancy companies and providers of equipment can help the country with the development of these frameworks, business models and equipment. For example, the design of necessary EPR systems and offering solutions for tire recycling and recycling infrastructure for C&D waste to enhance a circular economy. 7. Concluding remarks Since 2017, the government has made big steps forward by introducing the first circular economy roadmap, the updated waste management law 1501 and the C&D waste valorization legislation. Additional steps should be taken by the different ministries and their sectors to have a sustainable waste management system, in not only the principal cities but as well in the rural areas. Afterwards, the country will be ready to implement a circular economy strategy. 6 References i International Monetary Fund (2019).

Although there are efforts to promote this infrastructure, coverage is still limited, and its distribution does not always respond to the needs of the different regions. This, added to the lack of environmental awareness and local capacity to efficiently manage these points, makes it difficult to achieve an adequate plastic waste management system in the country.\n\n■ Collection of data related to waste in general\nSpecific Challenges:\nIn Peru, one of the main challenges in collecting waste-related data is linked to the quality of the information reported. Many municipalities and actors responsible for waste management face difficulties in collecting, processing and reporting consistent and reliable data due to technical, financial and human capacity limitations. This generates inconsistencies and gaps in reporting, making it difficult to build a solid baseline for monitoring and evaluation. In addition, the lack of standardization in data collection methods and the absence of adequate validation negatively impact the quality of the information.\n\n■ Collection of data related to marine plastic litter\nSpecific Challenges:\n\n■ Lack of financial incentives for waste treatment in general\nSpecific Challenges:\nIn Peru, although the legal framework for solid waste includes financial incentives for citizens, such as discounts on municipal taxes to promote segregation and proper waste management, their implementation by local governments remains limited.\n\n■ Lack of financial incentives for technological development\nSpecific Challenges:\n\nBack to the Top\n\nContact Details\n\nName: Veronika Magaly Mendoza Diaz\nPosition: Director of the Directorate of Solid Waste Management Instruments and Circularity\nDivision: General Directorate of Solid Waste Management\nOrganization: Ministry of Environment\nEmail: vmendoza@minam.gob.pe\n\nRecent Meeting\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\nThis portal site has been created by the Ministry of the Environment, Japan and managed by the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) under the initiative of the G20 Implementation Framework for Actions on Marine Plastic Litter.\n\nAbout this page, please contact\n\nName: Veronika Magaly Mendoza Diaz\nPosition: Director of the Directorate of Solid Waste Management Instruments and Circularity\nDivision: General Directorate of Solid Waste Management\nOrganization: Ministry of Environment\nEmail: vmendoza@minam.gob.pe\n\nName: Veronika Magaly Mendoza Diaz\nPosition: Director of the Directorate of Solid Waste Management Instruments and Circularity\nDivision: General Directorate of Solid Waste Management\nOrganization: Ministry of Environment\nEmail: vmendoza@minam.gob.pe\n\n© Towards Osaka Blue Ocean Vision -  G20 Implementation Framework for Actions on Marine Plastic Litter\n\n"

I have been very fortunate to have been in the company of so many outstanding people that have been with me throughout this wonderful and challenging journey. The first and deepest words of gratitude go to my committee chair, Jen Brass. I could have hardly reached this point without her. She has fully cared about me in many dimensions: my work, my progress, my wellbeing, my family. Her trust on me helped me find my own voice in academia, even when I was not sure I could have one or a place in it. She gave me the chance to turn big, unpolished ideas into a line of research that is not only meaningful to researchers but also to the people in less privileged parts of the world. She guided me on how to use the toughest methods in a field where these are uncommon –– qualitative and mixed methods, that is. All confidence I have in my work started and turned stronger through her advice. Jen’s patience, empathy, compassion, and thoughtfulness kept me sane and motivated all these years. Words will never be enough to express my heartfelt gratitude. She has the heart of a true mentor. As my role model, I can only hope to emulate a small fraction of her greatness. I am also exceedingly grateful to Sergio Fernandez, Lauren MacLean, and Matt Baggetta, who have been beside me every step of this path, literally. Sergio was the first to show me that my family could actually bloom in Bloomington. And bloom we did, thanks to his vision. Then, he showed me the depths of organizational theory and organizational behavior, and strengthened my confidence on the type of public administration research I do today. Through him, I also learn about the broader reality of the field and how to navigate it. Our lengthy conversations, about research and life, have been one of the most precious moments I have had all these years. vi Matt is an amazingly dedicated and caring mentor. Learning with him and his advice made huge impacts on this dissertation. He trusted me with work on his diversity layer project and to put together a highly complex dataset when I was not sure about my proficiency with Stata. He gave me the opportunity to really polish those skills early on. Most importantly, he gave me the chance to discover how I could incorporate a novel tool used in sociology in my own fieldwork. Through the project and through our conversations, he graciously led me to learn how to use the Systematic Social Observation technique to evaluate waste service performance in Peru. It had significantly shaped the structure of my fieldwork, leading me to rigorously collect and quantify data from qualitative observations. His guidance through the job market process was extraordinary, and I still remember each one of his words –– I could not have done it without him. The trust he placed on me meant a tremendous deal. Lauren has been an incredibly supportive teacher and mentor. From her, I learned my fieldwork research methods, how to think about development in the Global South, how to be a kind colleague and researcher, and so much more. She taught me how academia can be kind, generous, and respectful for the growth of everyone. She is the mentor of mentors, and I have been greatly blessed to have her on my side and be inspired by her existence. Sean Nicholson-Crotty has given me advice since I had a very early-stage draft when I took his public management course during my first semester. His support, patience, and encouragement regardless of how broad and unrefined my ideas were determinant. Claudia Avellaneda gave me the energy to really reach out to municipalities from the very beginning, to get insights on the issues more directly from them. She also motivated me to find my data from the very first day and I cannot thank her enough for this significant contribution to my research. vii They are, above all, amazing people to be around and work, and I was honored and privileged to have them on my dissertation committee. Any progress I have had is because of each one of them. The feeling of gratitude is immense, beyond words. I am also grateful to the amazing staff from the O’Neill School, the Department of Political Science, and the Ostrom Workshop at Indiana University – Bloomington. The dedication, patience, and kindness of Kelli Jacobs throughout these years, even before the start of the program, was significant. She is always thinking about ways to help doctoral students. Her support made a huge difference these years –– we are all so blessed to have her around. Donna Pritchett, Chris McCann, David Price, Gayle Higgins, Emily Castle, Genia Marvin, and Amanda Campbell are all genuinely committed to graduate students’ progress and I was very fortunate to work with them. I would also like to thank the directors of my two doctoral programs Sergio Fernandez, Armando Razo, Sean Nicholson-Crotty, Tim Hellwig, and Justin Ross, who have also been incredibly supportive these years. Directors of the Ostrom Workshop Scott Shackelford, Gustavo Torrens, Jessica Steinberg, and Lee Alston have also helped my work in numerous ways. Several professors and researchers have also made very important contributions to my research. I am deeply grateful to Deanna Malatesta, Jack Bielasiak, Daniel Simon, Marjorie Hershey, Miguel Jaramillo, and Brad Fulton for their generosity in providing insightful comments and feedback on several portions of my dissertation and academic career. My graduate student friends and colleagues have helped me enjoy this process even more. Natalia Ramírez and her family, Ricardo Bello-Gómez, Josefina Cárcamo, Julio Zambrano, Johabed Olvera, Felipe Lozano, Julio Ramos, Lang “Kate” Yang, Anna Keune, Gabriel Piña, and Janet Jock, thank you for all the wonderful times we spent together. Our viii dinners and outings were always fun and full of laughter. I am also grateful to the encouraging conversations and support of Tony DeMattee, Megan Darnley, Ruth Winecoff, Janet Jock, Godfreyb Ssekajja, Taha Hameddudin. Also, my peers from soccer and aikido always provided an opportunity to relax. I am also deeply indebted to my peers from the Brass Club who have carefully read all my drafts and provided truly generous comments. Tony DeMattee, Tonya Dodez, Nabila Rahman, Janet Jock, Alesha Porisky, Elise Harrington, Qun Wang, William Decourt, Eric Layman, Marylis Fantoni, Justin Schon, Stefan Carpenter, Laura Montenovo, are all members of the Brass Club that during these years made this work significantly better. The feedback from discussants and participants at workshops and conferences has also improved my work. This includes presentations at the Ostrom Workshop, American Political Science Association (APSA), Midwest Political Science Association (MPSA), Association for Research on Nonprofit Organizations and Voluntary Action (ARNOVA), and the Group for the Analysis of Development (GRADE) based in Peru. I also thank Grant Rissler, Mary Feeney, David Suarez, Kimberly Nelson, Eric Zeemering, and the anonymous reviewers who provided thoughtful comments and suggestions on my published articles. My research received generous funding from the O’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs, Ostrom Workshop, President’s Diversity Dissertation Scholarship, Integrated Program in the Environment, Tobias Center for Innovation in International Development, Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies, Roy W. Shin Fellowship, at Indiana University – Bloomington. Without their trust for my work, this dissertation would not be possible. ix I have also been blessed by the support I received in the field. I was fortunate to have the opportunity to work and learn from my research assistant, Karen Cecilia Peralta Durán, whose commitment to the topic and wide expertise on environmental management greatly improved my dissertation and from whom I learned so much about environmental management. I am profoundly thankful to her. Also, I am grateful to the civil servants and civil society organizations of the municipalities of Bagua Grande, in the Amazonas region; Marangani, San Pablo, Sicuani, and Tinta, in the Cusco region; Satipo, in the Junín region. Similarly, the civil servants of the Decentralization Secretariat, Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Finance, and National Statistics Institute of Peru, of the Government of Peru, for generously sharing their knowledge and providing support for this study. The leaders and members of neighborhood associations, indigenous communities, mothers’ clubs, and community kitchens went out of their way to talk with me and share their views and experiences. What they do for their communities and cities is deserving of tremendous gratitude, recognition and support. I am especially grateful to the leaders and members of the Sicuani Community Kitchen Central (CENCOPPS) for their support for my work. I am your fan. Throughout these years, I have also been blessed by the support and generosity of specific public servants in the national government for obtaining the data for my research. I am grateful to Aníbal Sánchez Aguilar, Deputy Head of the National Statistics Institute of Peru; Edgardo Cruzado Silverii, former Viceminister of Territorial Governance and former Secretary of the Decentralization Secretariat of the Prime Minister’s Office; Donny Chumpitaz Maldonado, Coordinator of the Geospatial Data System of the Prime Minister’s Office; Moraima Espinoza Pereda, from the Prime Minister’s Office; José Valdivia Morón, former General Secretary of the Ministry of Environment of Peru; Álex Távara Aranibar, from the Decentralization Secretariat of x the Prime Minister’s Office; Stephanie Pérez, from the Decentralization Secretariat of the Prime Minister’s Office, and; Verónika Mendoza Díaz, from the Solid Waste Management General Division of the Ministry of Environment of Peru. Above all, my family is what motivates me to do all this with love and dedication. The unconditional love and strength my parents, Pipo and Patricia, guides all my life. My work ethics come from them. They showed me that the challenges we face exist only to be overcome. We came as immigrants from Peru exactly 20 years ago. We started with nothing, but they never gave up. We did all sorts of this to earn a living –– and we kept going. We struggled, with the language, with total ignorance on how to navigate the system, with discrimination. But we kept going. They kept going. With a steady and full heart, they are always willing to give, always there to support me. I will never forget where we came from and what you taught me to do to succeed: Never to give up, never to lose heart and passion. Los adoro con mi vida. My sister, Karina, and my brother, Stefano, whose constant love, presence, and laughter have also made the journey more enjoyable. Their energy for life and resilience is an inspiration and I love them dearly. The admirable strength, deep compassion, and sense of humor of my mother-in-law, Mirian, always kept my spirit up. I am her admirer. Our Astro, our beautiful and crazy Siberian Husky, came into our lives during the pandemic, when he was not yet two months old. He brought us so much love, joy, and laughter, and kept us on our feet during a time we needed it the most. Although I may have trained him to be more gentle, he has trained me in more significant ways as a human being. I also wholeheartedly thank my spiritual guides, Giancarlo and Karina, who taught me how to heal from the inside out –– this journey also included (and required) a doctorate in emotional wellbeing. I could not have done all this without their wisdom. My uncle, Perico, has xi been my mentor since I finished college, and I have much to thank him. He was always beside me, sharing his experiences and insights on politics and development, which strengthened my confidence about the relevance of my research. The two utmost special people in my life were by my side every single second of this wonderful journey: my wife and son. They are everything to me. The one person that deserves all my praise, admiration, and most profound love and gratitude is my soulmate, my wife Kely. She has gracefully lifted me after each fall, wiped away my tears, and helped me become stronger inside. We have built a beautiful family together, we have created a wonderful life together, we have raised the kindest, thoughtful, and caring young boy –– but it is all because of her. She puts the smile and the joy in everything. She showed me to do every little and simple thing with all the love we have. She taught me all this and I am all the better because of her. I owe it all to her. My son, Fabio, is the light of my days and the reason why I try to be the best version of myself every day and on all fronts, especially as a human being. The most glorious thing in my life is to be his dad. It has been the blessing of each one of my days to have him in my life, to share all sorts of moments with him, to listen to him share his events at school and his thoughts and feelings. He would take me off from my research each day, sit on my lap, and share all his genuine joy. Just to be there with him and see him always with a smile and enthusiasm for life is all I ask, and gave me the energy to carry on. I want nothing more than to share a life together and see him grow happy and with a full heart. Thank you both for all you did for me all these years. xii Preface In 2018, I traveled to Peru to understand the process of providing waste services on the ground. I wanted to explore how municipalities manage waste collection and disposal and see if, by tracing the mechanisms for delivery, I could uncover the common problems affecting their performance. My original concern was that municipalities in the Global South received scarce attention for the insurmountable tasks they are expected to carry out while facing significant administrative limitations. Thinking about the increasing damages observed in recent years associated with climate change that these local governments have to tackle puzzled me when comparing them to how little we knew about what is happening inside these small but intricate bureaucracies. As a direct service responsibility of municipalities with non-negligible climate change implications, waste management seemed like a suitable case to study. My previous work experience as a public servant and public sector consultant was helpful. It showed me that to understand performance problems, we not only need to learn about the internal characteristics of public agencies and the involved offices but that we can also discover important explanations ––and particularly bottlenecks–– by delineating the contours of the processes followed up to the final provision. Thus, I was not convinced that limiting my research design to statistical analysis using aggregate municipal statistics would give me an honest and actionable picture as to why and the degree to which local governments are struggling administratively. Through my research, I wanted to address important service provision problems with consequential and expansive implications. While conducting exploratory fieldwork in Peru on the waste management processes in a small set of municipalities, I gathered information about specific municipal office-level characteristics and the service provision process. This led me to discover three intriguing xiii situations, including one that was not entirely on my radar. First, we tend to think ––and even take for granted–– that services in the same policy domain managed by a given municipality share similar performance levels, because, after all, they are usually provided by the same office. In fact, we rarely stop to notice the nuanced distinctions between related public services, as happened in my case. Yet, contrary to this assumption, I found that distinct waste services such as collection and disposal have differential performance levels. This was the first puzzling finding at this early stage of my research. Second, typically, we also expect municipal offices to have differentiated capabilities since they lead the provision of not one but multiple services simultaneously. The rationale is that even if services are in the same policy domain, they can have different requirements for implementation, so local government units should have the administrative capacity each of those services needs. This expectation seemed distant from the truth for waste service provision on the ground. When conducting exploratory interviews in Peru, I realized that municipal offices were not giving the same level of attention to both waste services. This revealed these services received unequal administrative treatment, in which one was favored over the other, and by far. This was my second unexpected discovery. Why was there a pattern of differences in waste service performance and capacity, favoring waste collection in both instances? A closer look at interview and ethnographic notes from this early-stage exploratory fieldwork and waste management literature showed me that waste collection and disposal are two very different services to manage, where one is more operationally and technically complex than the other. Such realization was a surprise because, in my review of the relevant literature, I had not come across recent research on administrative capacity and service provision that comparatively analyzed local governments and service xiv performance based on the relative complexity of services within the same policy domain. Similarly, I had not found studies that went beyond evaluating general measures of municipal capacity to assess office-level capacity specific to a service to explain performance. These surprising findings led me to revise my underlying research question, giving birth to the core puzzle of this dissertation project. They had methodological implications, producing an iterative, dynamic updating of my research design (Kapiszewski et al. 2022; MacLean et al. 2019). As a result, my research engaged in a two-way dialogue between quantitative and qualitative methods to obtain profound answers and a more complete, nuanced understanding of waste service performance differences and their core drivers, particularly the role of service-specific administrative capacity at the municipal office level. Finally, the role of CSO involvement in waste service provision was not part of my original research question. I was aware that some localities, one in particular, carried out waste services through a group of low-income mother heads of households, but, at the time, I did not fully grasp the extent of their involvement. I had not stopped to carefully think about how, more broadly, CSOs’ organizational conditions and relationship with the municipality or even the extent to which how local authorities perceived them mattered for waste service provision performance. After all, like other public services, waste management is the sole responsibility of governments such as municipalities. This was my third fortuitous finding from exploratory fieldwork. It was puzzling to see how two strongly structured community-based CSOs did all the heavy-lifting of the waste collection service in one locality. They thoroughly cleaned the streets, even after highly active wet market weekends where small agricultural producers brought and directly sold all their fresh produce. Blocks full of discarded fruit, vegetables, and sometimes animal bones and meat xv surrounded the markets at the end of the day at 10pm, entirely covering the streets and sidewalks. You had to step on all that to walk around the area. Street sweeping teams would arrive a few hours after midnight and, upon my return at 4am, it was a completely new place. You could not see a single plastic bag lying on the floor. Walking with them for hours overnight when they conducted their rounds throughout the city streets further revealed how they worked. The level of diligence of the entire operation was comparable to that of a professionally run, exceedingly efficient, and likely profitable business. The workers were committed, field supervisors were motivated and oversaw all implementation details on the ground in real-time. A management team thoroughly planned the logistics and strategically handled client relations. With 28 years of working experience, back in 2018, they had a long-standing institutional knowledge that could hardly fail. This is how I noticed that the two CSOs were top-level waste collection experts. The waste suboffice itself rarely intervened as a result. They had fully allowed the CSOs to take over all the implementation parts. Other municipalities I visited during this exploratory stage did not have this provision setup. Yet, as I continued exploring this municipality’s waste disposal services, I was perplexed to learn about its state of abandonment, particularly after comparing it with the provision of collection services. At the dump, only a handful of CSO members were manually accommodating bags as best they could. Disposal tasks were carried out with great limitations. So, I began to ask myself: Why are these CSOs not as involved in waste disposal? And, why are CSOs in other municipalities not working with the waste suboffice if they are struggling with waste service provision, particularly disposal? I realized that I needed information on CSOs’ organizational characteristics to learn whether their internal workings could provide some xvi answers to these puzzles and, more importantly, find additional explanations for the performance differences between collection and disposal. Through these experiences and thought processes, I began developing my dissertation into what it is today. It led me to closely see the inner workings of local governance for service provision, particularly one with significant implications for global environmental sustainability. It showed me how little attention we give to essential services, such as waste collection and disposal. This process also led me to realize that practitioners and researchers could do more to support the arduous jobs of local public servants and communities, who somehow preserve the environment and their livelihoods with minimal resources and recognition. I hope this dissertation will, in some way, help improve service provision in Global South cities, especially for the most vulnerable groups, through research designs based on interacting with those most affected on the ground by the issues we study. xvii References Kapiszewski, Diana, Lauren M MacLean, and Benjamin L Read. 2022. \"Dynamic Research Design: Iteration in Field-Based Inquiry.\" Comparative politics.

Administrative Capacity, Governance, and Waste Management in Peruvian Municipalities Abstract. Global South cities vary in their ability to provide complex social services, like environmentally proper solid waste disposal, but typically perform better with simple services, like trash collection from the streets. This dissertation examines whether core local governance factors determine these performance disparities to help bring light to a consequential pattern of service delivery issues in Global South municipalities. Three crucial factors are studied to answer the following overarching puzzle: Why are some local governments successful at providing simple services while at the same time blatantly failing at providing complex services, when other, similar municipalities can do both? I focus on service-specific municipal administrative capacity, formal community-based civil society organizations (CSO) involvement, and local collaborative governance. In this dissertation, I make four principal arguments. The first argument is that it is insufficient to examine municipality-wide administrative capacity to understand what is happening to service performance in a particular policy area. Instead, the second argument states that it is more accurate to assess service-specific administrative capacity, and such capacity may differ across simple and complex tasks, even in the same service. Drawing on comparative quantitative and qualitative evidence, I show that similarly-resourced municipal waste suboffices that can do both simple and complex services differ from those that fail in that they have multi-level capacity tailored to service complexity level. The third argument is that CSOs can substitute for or complement local government in implementing simple service provision, but complex service provision requires strong, xix specialized capacity within the local government offices. CSOs are unlikely to be able to provide such complex services in the absence of administrative capacity. I show that, at least in Global South cities like those in Peru, organizationally strong CSOs can manage waste collection efficiently and effectively, but their missions, planning, operational, and leadership capabilities limit their involvement in disposal due to the complexity of disposal’s requirements. Moreover, most CSOs do not have the type of relationship with municipal government ––nor the respect of local officials–– needed to provide complex services. The fourth argument claims that local collaborative governance contributes to performance improvements if it addresses performance issues equally across services. I find that cogovernance venues matter locally, in the Global South, for improving simple service performance. This work employs a mixed-methods research design. It uses a unique panel dataset of all Peruvian municipalities across three years for quantitative analysis of the effect of municipal capacity, CSO presence, and cogovernance on simple collection and complex disposal. It also draws on qualitative interview and ethnographic data from four and a half months of intensive fieldwork in three municipalities, which was used for comparative analysis of the conditions in which municipal capacity and CSO participation affect both waste services. xx Table of Contents 2 Chapter 1: Introduction1 Municipalities in the Global South vary in their ability to provide public services. These government actors struggle not only with complex public services, like environmentally proper solid waste disposal, but even simple services, like waste collection from the streets. While it is generally challenging to provide services in these contexts, one is more likely to find clean streets with most waste collected than properly disposed of waste, even while both are managed by the same local government office. Three cases help illustrate why this has global significance. Walking through the streets of urban and rural towns of Cusco, in the southern Andes of Peru, you rarely see large amounts of uncollected waste accumulating and rotting for several days. In Sicuani, for instance, which is one of the largest cities, waste pickers check their schedules, team up, and readily get to the streets during the wee hours. Even after a busy wet market weekend that makes its environment look like a waste battleground, the market is left anew with a few rounds. Waste collection is delivered by low-income single mothers from indigenous communities who are also members of a poverty-alleviation local civil society organization (CSO) –– they cannot afford to underperform their job. Waste disposal, on the contrary, is neglected territory. These women are seldom involved in this waste service, and the municipal waste manager struggles to deal with it in a two-person office with a sluggish computer. To compound these issues, the dumpsite is within the land of an indigenous community that is now seeing how its soil, rivers, and downstream fields and animals are 1 Some portions of this chapter were originally published in my following two articles: 2021. \"Exploring Administrative Capacity and Local Governance in the Peruvian Waste Sector: Implications for Complex Service Delivery in the Global South.\" State and Local Government Review 53(2): 122-141; 2022. \"Do Cogovernance and CSOs Supplement Municipal Capacity for Service Delivery?

Local collaborative governance ––or the multi-stakeholder relationship to form partnerships in key local decisions–– is also frail and often absent because mayors and managers do not invite community members to the table. Thus, the dumpsite is a series of informal2 open holes where trash overflows, flies away, and decomposes. Bagua Grande ––a comparable city located in the northern Amazonas Region of Peru–– faces similar performance challenges but a particularly insurmountable one for waste disposal. Temporary municipal employees start their waste picking routines early in the morning. After working full-day and making several rounds across the city’s most active and accessible areas, waste gets collected from most streets. Employees do their best at this task, even risking their own lives3 for a poor salary. They say they do it because the government job provides some stability to vulnerable households such as theirs. Still, the large amount of waste manually gathered each day is informally dumped ––and forever forgotten–– on the bare soil of a large municipal open field outside the city. This practice is part of the regular waste disposal process. “We do a really good job delivering waste services overall, we just need the money to turn this dumpsite into a landfill4 to dispose of it better,” I recalled being told by a municipal waste officer as I walked over rotting, scattered organic material and hospital needles covering all the dumpsite’s area (Int-BG-1). Formal recyclers come and go from this area, gathering reusable material to make a living. They are usually joined by cows, dogs, and vultures searching for food. Run by a single manager supported by two untrained collection supervisors, this waste 2 Informal dump holes are uncontrolled and typically untreated dumpsites that are not officially approved because they involve potential human and environmental danger. 3 Risks for waste workers in this context involve breathing contamination, injuries from used needles and glass found in waste bags, falling from an improvised collection truck, among others. 4 A dump refers to an uncontrolled and usually untreated disposal site that is not officially approved due to its potential for human and environmental harm. A landfill is an officially approved disposal site that has protective measures and infrastructures that typically prevent human and environmental damages. 4 office is limited to basic collection procedures. Unlike Sicuani, Bagua Grande does not involve community CSOs in their waste service provision scheme, despite urgent need and having active CSOs in the area. Although local collaborations could serve to collectively address these waste problems, local authorities express disdain or unawareness of such arrangements. While Satipo ––in the central Peruvian region of Junin–– has similar socioeconomic and geographic conditions, it fairs significantly better in the delivery of both waste services relative to the other two cities. Overnight waste collection teams and trucks follow their routines under the leadership of the waste collection deputy manager and field supervisors. The process is not immune to difficulties, such as personnel absences or compactor truck mechanical problems, but they are minor or quickly addressed by dedicated public servants. All streets and markets start the day pristine. Local communities are also engaged in the collection process. Neighborhood associations ––formal, community-based CSOs led by neighborhood leaders that represent their collective interest–– communicate with their residents about sorting waste into recyclables, non-recyclables, and organic waste and the days and times that specific trucks will come around to separately take each classified bag. These CSOs receive the information from the municipality’s Community Governance Unit that leads local interactions regarding public services with environmental implications, such as waste. Community involvement helps the disposal process conducted by the municipality, which as a result can recycle, compost, and minimize pressure and contamination in the landfill. Unlike Sicuani and Bagua Grande, Satipo has a complete and formal infrastructure to professionally treat disposed of waste in a landfill managed by a team of well-equipped, trained operators and two landfill engineers. The community that houses the landfill ––also under a formal agreement–– occasionally complains about strong smells coming out of the facility but is normally rapidly addressed by the waste office manager and its compact 5 team of environmental engineers. While local collaborations can be difficult, this municipality can effectively handle its relationship with local CSOs, neighboring local governments, and other key stakeholders to tackle waste management and environmental issues. In terms of outcomes, this illustrates how Bagua Grande and Sicuani struggle to dispose of their waste but do an acceptable job collecting waste from the streets, although Satipo performs exceedingly well in both. The experiences of the three municipalities are not isolated among low- and middle-income countries. They represent service performance disparities that are observed globally. To systematically explore this empirical phenomenon, this dissertation accounts for the varying performance between a simple service, like waste collection, and a more complex service, such as waste disposal, in Peruvian municipalities. These differences generate a fundamental question in comparative public administration: Why are some local governments successful at providing simple services (e.g., collecting waste) while at the same time blatantly failing at providing complex services (e.g., disposing of waste), when other similar municipalities can do both? An array of answers is possible, such as waste collection’s political salience or the lack of resources for costly infrastructural investments for waste disposal. Yet, these only get to the surface of a more intricate problem. What is suggestive of a deeper issue is the worldwide pattern in the gap between the two services. This is noted in the fact that, for instance, municipalities in lower and lower-middle income countries can collect 39 percent and 51 percent, respectively, of the waste they generate but adequately dispose of 7 percent and 34 percent (Kaza et al. 2018, 35). Upper-middle income countries also show a similar struggle, collecting 82 percent and adequately disposing of 70 percent of their waste but still improperly dispose of 30 percent, which ends up in informal open dumps (Kaza et al. 2018, 35). 6 This evidence from around the world shows that municipalities, mostly in the Global South, have relatively higher waste collection rates but lower proper waste disposal rates. A relevant caveat regarding this aggregate, national-level data ––which is based on municipal-level data–– is that it likely masks larger local disparities and is thus biased by the performance of larger, better resourced local governments. A closer look at disaggregate municipal-level statistics reveals this discrepancy. Municipalities in some upper-middle income countries like Peru have below-average waste performance, showing wide gaps between the two services. Thus, searching for detailed answers about why these divergences in waste service provision occur, and the conditions under which they emerge, is of global importance. Beyond its public health and property value consequences, decaying waste, which usually results from failed waste service provision, also has implications for environmental sustainability. It produces a highly contaminant greenhouse gas (GhG) called methane that causes much more damage than carbon dioxide (IPCC 2007, 212). To make matters worse, when it rains, as it does in the three cities discussed and across the Global South, improperly collected or disposed of waste blocks drainage and sewage systems, further complicating the consequences of heavy rain and flooding (which, in turn, are increasingly aggravated by climate change). I argue that three core local governance factors determine these performance disparities, helping bring light to a consequential pattern of service delivery issues in Global South cities. In particular, I examine how service-specific municipal administrative capacity, formal community-based CSO involvement, and local collaborative governance matter when services increase in relative complexity. I find that having service-specific capacity has a twofold effect: unlike general capacity and other measures, it improves both simple and complex services’ performance and supports the influence of the other two factors on performance. 7 Looking beyond common expectations of widespread failure in municipal service provision found in the Global South ––where local governments sometimes experience rampant inefficiency and corruption–– can lead us to recognize that some key services are regularly handled well by these bureaucracies but that they are especially challenged by services with distinctly complex characteristics. What is similarly intriguing is the significant variation observed in all three local governance factors across municipalities. Office-level capacity to manage each service ranges from some with no administrative specialization and pooled resources for both services in cluttered offices to others with highly differentiated procedures, experienced and trained human resources, and equipment for each one. Community CSO involvement encompasses informal, fragmented groups expecting a call from the mayor for participation alongside sophisticated, formal organizations with robust structures and membership that lead parts of local services. In terms of local collaborations, there are localities where they go overlooked as well as those carrying out joint action plans with formally designated responsibilities by stakeholder. An in-depth analysis of Peruvian municipalities shows these patterns when comparing waste collection and waste disposal outcomes and the role of the three determinants. Surprisingly, most studies on service performance concentrate on local governments’ general capacity, assume that any civil society participation suffices to influence service delivery, or insufficiently study the collaboration-performance relationship, regardless of task complexity. Likewise, most services are typically treated as if they had monotonous features, implying equal complexity across the board. In contrast, in this dissertation I classify services by their complexity level, learning about their distinct features to contrast their relative performance. To assess the drivers of these performance variations, I trace the contours of 8 administrative capacity at the municipal waste office level to identify the degree to which such capacity is specific (or not) to the administrative and operational needs of a service, simple or complex. Similarly, I delve into the internal characteristics of formal community CSOs and local collaborative governance venues ––and, in turn, their interaction with municipal waste offices–– in relation to each service. This dissertation helps to advance knowledge on issues related to local governance and complex service delivery in the Global South. It engages with research on government capacity, CSO participation, and collaborative governance, in the context of local waste service provision in public administration, comparative politics, and environmental studies. Its nuanced, deductive-inductive approach to studying service performance matters for comparative public administration research because it makes five theoretical contributions that could also be relevant for the study of a range of local governments around the world. First, it provides a more detailed understanding of the role of administrative capacity on service performance by disaggregating and capturing this concept through tighter, more proximate measures. Second, it shows CSOs’ differential role on service performance when services vary in complexity. Third, when they work, local collaborative governance venues are found crucial for improving simple service performance and the efficient use of scarce municipal resources. Fourth, unpacking the analysis of services and service performance based on complexity levels helps reach a more detailed, nuanced understanding of service provision limitations. Finally, it incorporates a classification of services by their relative complexity to others within their policy domain, based on three task dimensions. This work is built through a mixed-methods research design. It uses a unique quantitative panel dataset of all Peruvian municipalities in 2014, 2016, and 2018. Using this methodological 9 approach, this study captures the main drivers of performance and their differential effects on services of varying complexity. These quantitative results guided the collection of qualitative data from four and a half months of intensive fieldwork via interviews, ethnography, systematic social observations, and secondary sources in three municipal case studies also in Peru (Baggetta and Bredenkamp 2021; Falleti and Lynch 2009; Fulton and Baggetta 2021; Hendren et al. 2018; Kapiszewski et al. 2015; MacLean et al. 2019; Raudenbush and Sampson 1999; Smith 2005). The qualitative approach provides in-depth evidence on the three local governance drivers examined and helps trace the causal mechanisms leading to waste service performance differences. Greater insights from findings are obtained through a mixed-methods research design, which is crucial to answer the core research question while also contributing to identifying alternative explanations and illustrating quantitative results with more precision. 1.1 Local Governance Differences Why are some local governments successful at providing simple waste collection services while at the same time blatantly failing at providing complex waste disposal services, when other similar municipalities can do both? To address this fundamental question, the argument of this dissertation centers on three elements of local governance ––administrative capacity, CSOs, and local collaborative governance–– to elucidate why and how waste service performance disparities occur. Exploratory fieldwork in Peru shows that these three factors drive very different outcomes between the two services, regardless of the population size and resources of a city (de la Riva Agüero 2021). Waste offices have adequate capacity to deliver waste collection. This means that they are specialized and equipped to carry out its provision correctly and that local 10 politicians, CSOs, and joint local decision-making venues are usually supportive because it is a salient service. Waste disposal, conversely, has very poor performance. A combination of poor planning capacity and discriminatory attitudes toward waste service employees in the field –– many of which are low-income, indigenous female members of community CSOs–– may partly restrain waste managers from involving them in the disposal process. This qualitative assessment of elements that appear to be important for understanding why some services are performed better than others also points toward a more accurate consideration and measurement of certain factors. For instance, general capacity typically signals some favorable overall municipal conditions or local political decisions to support the allocation of relatively more resources to waste management. However, general capacity features do not reflect whether they effectively translate into more waste management capacity and, particularly, what waste service benefits and how substantial these investments are for their performance. This indicates that studying capacity focused on service-specific administrative capacity, rather than general capacity, provides a more accurate understanding of public service performance issues. Although municipal waste office capabilities in Peru are neither ideal nor abundant and, in fact, have many weaknesses, particularly in administrative terms for smaller or under-resourced municipalities, they systematically keep collection teams operating effectively to clean the streets. While this service is not negligible, its management is not intricate. The opposite occurs with waste disposal. Municipalities do not have formal landfills and dispose of much of their waste in uncontrolled, poorly supervised, and overflowing dumpsites lacking minimal infrastructural requirements. These facilities thus lack official permission from the national government. Evidently, waste offices have serious capacity flaws to administer this service. Their management teams and policies are not particularly tailored nor trained or equipped to 11 handle the demands associated with it. CSO participation in the disposal provision process is usually substantially limited and venues of local joint decision-making are commonly weakly organized to address such a complex matter. Regardless of these disposal management difficulties, some waste offices can do a remarkable job in the provision of waste collection services even with moderate administrative capacity to handle it. This means that, for collection, having well-drafted collection routines, diagnostic documents, and basic supporting equipment is sufficient, even with absent CSO participation and local collaborative governance venues that address key service issues. On the contrary, it is not uncommon to find municipalities that structure their waste disposal capacity based on a dumping routine, makeshift trucks, and computers for a handful of office workers, which is blatantly insufficient for the adequate provision of disposal services. Waste management, as a whole, requires a range of capabilities for core functions like contracting, procurement, and human resource management to more specialized skills such as forecasting changes in waste generation over time, devising differentiated management strategies, and coordinating with numerous stakeholders (Abarca-Guerrero et al. 2013; Kaza et al. 2018; Okot-Okumu and Nyenje 2011; Srivastava et al. 2015). But this comprehensive service also has requirements that vary by service. For instance, on the one hand, key to waste collection services is planning routines and assigning routes and schedules to waste picking personnel, cleaning equipment, and vehicles. The task is simple but requires having an accurate inventory of the office’s resources. Problem-solving during collection implementation receives more immediate attention than the more complex but less noticeable waste disposal service because an interruption in collection is highly visible and has social and thus political implications. The latter likely affects the allocation of resources between such services as well. Another 12 characteristic of waste policies in Global South cities is that about 80 percent of waste management budgets are allocated to the less complex collection services, while higher-income countries ––that have higher disposal capacity–– spend 10 percent on collection (Aleluia and Ferrão 2017; Kaza et al. 2018; Lohri et al. 2014). Disposal services are more complex, and costly. Their technical, infrastructural, and managerial requirements make it so. Landfills to treat and contain waste are critical, employing specialized equipment such as leachate containment geomembranes and tanks to hold runoff, as well as fencing surrounding the area. Specialized chimneys and piping are also used to safely treat methane gases generated by decomposing waste. Heavy machinery is key to organize and cover waste in layers alternated with soil to minimize any filtration of contaminated fluids to the ground. Managing these inputs require more lead time, technical knowledge, and well-documented policy tools and regulations (Abarca-Guerrero et al. 2013; Jeswani and Azapagic 2016; Kjeldsen et al. 2002). Moreover, because these infrastructure- and technical knowledge-intensive projects are typically sited on the outskirts of cities, creation of one may simultaneously suffer from insufficient political support and trigger NIMBY (not-in-my-backyard) resistance from communities near the proposed site. In some cases, however, disposal sites are located within the property of indigenous communities, usually the result of negotiations and a formal agreement outlining the conditions in which they temporarily lend the space to the municipality. For this to work, high community-municipality collaboration and a delicate balancing task from the waste office are necessary –– while simultaneously managing its traditional administrative and operational challenges along with community expectations. Conflict management capacity is vital for these municipal offices. 13 Given these unique features, assuming that all waste services can be equally provided without adapting local governance capabilities to service complexity is a mistake, especially if one is more complex than the other. Thus, to understand these diverging outcomes more accurately it is central to examine the office-level specific administrative capacity to deliver each service, the organizational characteristics and extent of involvement of CSOs, and whether and how local collaborative governance venues operate and make joint decisions for each service’s pressing needs. Further analysis confirms that it is pertinent to empirically assess these three elements. Municipal waste offices’ service-specific administrative capacity has crucial implications for understanding the performance of both relatively simple and complex waste management services. Unlike general municipal administrative capacity improvements that enhance only simple waste service provision, waste management administrative capacity illustrates that greater waste office specialization and equipment benefits both collection frequency and proper disposal services. The presence of neighborhood-based CSOs and local collaborative governance venues ––engaged in the joint local planning and budgeting–– only appear to enhance waste collection performance. A reason why these CSOs may not influence complex waste disposal is because they are centered on waste collection frequency or are more effective at supplementing the state when services are relatively simple. Local collaborations may not be associated with waste disposal performance as its issues are likely not a discussion priority in these specific local venues or are considered non-urgent matters. 14 Therefore, based on these evaluations and the evidence on waste service performance differences this dissertation addresses critical questions about the three elements of local governance: • Do cogovernance and CSOs supplement municipal capacity for service delivery? • Under what conditions does service-specific municipal administrative capacity affect the performance of both simple and complex services? Under what conditions does it make a difference on the performance of the two services? • Under what conditions does community-based CSO involvement affect the performance of simple services but not of more complex services? What CSO characteristics affect their successful participation in the service provision process, leading to improved performance? How do they interact with the municipality? In Chapter 2, I discuss how these concepts are theorized, defined, and operationalized. 1.2 Arguments I make four arguments. The first one asserts that it is sufficient to have low service-specific municipal administrative capacity or a formal, community-based CSO involved to deliver a simple service (i.e., waste collection) adequately. This means that for the streets to be clean, municipalities in the Global South must have at least one of these two conditions met. This claim also illustrates that the streets can be clean, or at least partially clean, even if municipal administrative capacity is low. Municipalities can thus continue to provide this simple service, despite administrative difficulties. Such performance could not be expected in the case of complex service provision (i.e., waste disposal), however, because services of this nature require a higher level of municipal administrative capacity that cannot be otherwise replaced. 15 A second argument states that it is necessary to have high service-specific municipal administrative capacity to perform adequately in the delivery of complex services. This means that it is necessary that the service-providing municipal office is specialized and equipped to manage a specific complex service to achieve high performance. It is thus not sufficient to have formal, community-based CSOs involved in the direct provision of waste disposal to guarantee acceptable performance levels. This dissertation hence argues that the involvement of such CSOs is particularly important when service-specific capacity is low, and the service is simple. More complex services, however, could benefit from the involvement of formal, community CSOs when they have a robust organizational capacity that is relevant for these services, especially when municipal service-specific capacity is low but enough to handle CSO participation in the delivery process, and in the absence of gender, racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic discrimination. What this indicates is that, on the one hand, well-organized community CSOs could supplement government in the provision of services when these are more complex and, on the other, that the level of administrative capacity may be a central determinant of performance when service complexity increases. A third related argument holds that the general administrative capacity of a local government is not sufficient to improve the performance of more complex services. Having this type of overall municipal capacity ––which is likely supportive but is typically distant from the actual service management and implementation–– does not guarantee that service-specific capacity exists at the responsible office level or that such unit will receive the specific administrative support to manage a complex service. Approaching service provision in this way leads to inaccurate identification and misrepresentation of the issues that affect performance, particularly for more complex services. 16 Finally, this leads to a fourth argument, that claims that to minimize performance differences when services vary in complexity, such as waste collection and disposal, it is necessary that local collaborative governance arrangements ––where local political authorities, municipal managers, community CSOs, and other stakeholders jointly participate–– exist and address performance issues equally across services. Local collaborative governance is expected to occur when municipal bureaucracies have higher administrative capacity as it implies managing the simultaneous involvement, inputs, and tasks of multiple actors. Therefore, local cogovernance venues may represent an alternative and more strategic way in which local stakeholders jointly make key decisions and coordinate efforts (and available capabilities and limitations) about both simple and complex services. 1.3 Why does all this matter? Broader Implications for Policy and Research This dissertation, broadly speaking, is a contribution to equity and inclusion from an environmental justice perspective. The study of local governance and simple and complex waste service provision also has significance for environmental sustainability. As discussed earlier in this chapter, inadequate waste collection and waste disposal, first, produces GhG strongly associated with severe rainfall resulting from warmer temperatures and, second, clogs sewage and drainage systems that cause destructive flooding (Douglas et al. 2009; IPCC 2007; Satterthwaite et al. 2007). Insufficiently studying these issues thus impact people’s livelihoods, wellbeing, and public service infrastructures, principally in vulnerable Global South localities. Most importantly, these damaging consequences have disproportionately adverse effects on the poor in the developing world (Hallegatte et al. 2016; IPCC 2015), further undermining equity, inclusion, and thus democracy as a government form. Understanding why and how service- 17 specific government capacity, community CSO involvement, and local collaborations matter for the provision of increasingly complex services with environmental relevance is hence crucial. This has great import for weak cities, especially in the Global South. Having a timely, solid grasp of the policy implications can similarly impact the extent to which inequality, exclusion, and environmental sustainability are worsened by the consequences of mismanaged waste services, in a context of rapid flux and uncertainty led by climate phenomena. Since environmental issues are rising poverty and inequality worldwide, precise actionable knowledge grounded in nested inference is both essential and urgent (Collier et al. 2010). Policymakers, civil society, and entire communities benefit from thorough research to inform their decisions. That is why how scholars approach a research puzzle is so significant (Ragin 2014, 164-167), not only for methodological rigor and stronger causal inference but for human sensibility and real-world insights and impact. Not talking to people on the ground and seeing them as data points and regression coefficients is not an option for questions such as the ones studied in this dissertation. Capturing their views and sentiments helps put their challenges in the right dimension, and learning face-to-face how they handle large problems with scarce resources uncovers a much-needed understanding of the processes connecting causes and outcomes in social science research. For all these reasons, studying waste service provision disparities in municipalities in a country like Peru through a mixed-method comparative case study research design is broadly important. 18 1.4 Outline of Dissertation Chapter 2 presents the theory and research design. Chapter 3 is a regression-based quantitative chapter that addresses the following question: Do cogovernance and CSOs supplement municipal capacity for simple versus complex services? The results show that, in Peru, while stronger waste offices, the presence of neighborhood CSOs, and cogovernance venues increase simple service performance, only waste office strengthening ––but not neighborhood CSO involvement or cogovernance venues–– help improve complex service provision. Building on the quantitative methods used for Chapter 3, Chapters 4 and 5 draw on qualitative methods to analyze two crucial local governance factors: administrative capacity and CSO involvement in service provision. Chapter 4 examines the following question: Under what conditions does service-specific municipal administrative capacity affect the performance of both simple and complex services? It looks at the conditions and causal mechanisms of waste services to argue that service-specific administrative capacity is critical for improving the performance of both simple collection and complex disposal. The results show that similarly-resourced municipal waste suboffices that can do both simple and complex services differ from those that fail in that they have multi-level capacity tailored to service complexity level. While most municipal capacity tends to be centered on simple waste collection, differentiated capacity to equally understand and carry out both waste services at the top leadership, management office team, and field worker levels is fundamental for improving the performance of more complex services. Chapter 5 evaluates the following question: Under what conditions does community-based CSO involvement affect the performance of simple services but not of more complex 19 services? It analyzes the conditions and causal mechanisms of waste services to argue that the organizational capacity of CSOs matters for its effects on services that vary in complexity. The results show that organizationally strong CSOs can manage waste collection efficiently and effectively, but their missions, planning, operational, and leadership capabilities limit their involvement in disposal due to the specialized, complex requirements of this service. Moreover, most CSOs do not have the type of relationship with municipal government ––nor the respect of local officials–– needed to provide complex services. Chapter 6, concludes, bringing the threads from Chapters 3 to 5 together, analyzing this dissertation’s broader contributions for public administration research, real-world problems, summarizes the main findings of what might be generalizable elsewhere, and briefly discusses what this means for policy.

Waste tends to be collected daily or every other day, though some municipalities do so with less frequency. In a context like Peru’s, collection frequency is crucial. The reason is that most localities do not have large community dumpsters, for residents and businesses to throw away their waste any time, or large trash containers at home that in other countries are provided by the municipality to all residents. For waste disposal, local governments employ several different methods, including the use of landfills, dumpsites, recycling, burning, and composting, with only the first one considered a proper disposal method when the landfill is professionally managed. Most municipalities utilize more than one strategy simultaneously due to the lack of landfills or insufficient space in those available (MINAM 2016, 21). Since there are 56 formal landfills in the country7 serving 192 municipalities, most 5 Some portions of this chapter were originally published in my following two articles: 2021. \"Exploring Administrative Capacity and Local Governance in the Peruvian Waste Sector: Implications for Complex Service Delivery in the Global South.\" State and Local Government Review 53(2): 122-141; 2022. \"Do Cogovernance and CSOs Supplement Municipal Capacity for Service Delivery?

It has two types of municipalities or local governments: Provincial municipalities, which are similar to US counties, and district municipalities, equivalent to US cities. Both provincial and district municipalities have specified jurisdictions and functions, with provincial governments prevailing over districts on specific tasks. Provincial municipalities manage their territories apart from the district municipalities it contains, and serve as the provincial capital. Overall, Peruvian cities vary in size, capacity, as well as the extent of civil society involvement in the delivery of services (Aragón and Casas 2008; Jaramillo and Wright 2015; Loayza et al. 2011; McNulty 2013; World Bank 2010). Urbanization level and ecological region are key features associated with differences across cities. 7 As of March 2021. 24 Peruvian municipalities resort to a combination of the other environmentally unsustainable methods. Municipal waste management is, therefore, a significant problem in Peru. Data illustrate performance differences between simple waste collection and complex waste disposal. The national average waste generation per capita has remained approximately the same in recent years,8 at 0.52 kilograms per day, ranging from 0.65 to 0.41. There are some significant differences at the municipal level within each regional government, nonetheless (MINAM 2018). Some noteworthy discrepancies persist when analyzing municipal waste generation and waste management over time. In 2002, the estimated total municipal solid waste generation was 12,986 metric tons per day, or about 4.74 million metric tons that year. While municipalities collected 73.7 percent of this total, they only disposed of 19.7 percent in formal landfills (MINAM 2016, 13). Waste production notably increased in 2014 to approximately 7.5 million metric tons of municipal solid waste, of which roughly 32 percent, or 2.4 million metric tons, were adequately disposed of in landfills. Of the remaining 5.1 million metric tons, 3.6 million metric tons were dumped in informal open-air dumpsites by municipalities themselves, after their personnel had collected it from the streets. This amount represents 48 percent of the total amount of waste generated that year (INEI 2015, 324). More recently, in 2016, about 8.36 million metric tons were collected by 1,818 municipalities, which is 98 percent of all 1,851 municipalities existing that year. Although only 23 percent (or 433) disposed of some portion of their collected waste in landfills, about 79 percent (or 1,463) used open-air dumpsites to get rid of some part of it (INEI 2018, 465-467). In 2017, 1,836 municipalities collected 8.13 million metric tons of waste, adding 18 more municipalities in one year. This indicates that less waste was collected by more cities but 8 The period considered for this calculation is 2013 through 2017. 25 representing the same proportion of municipalities as the previous year, or 98 percent, out of a total of 1,872 cities existing in 2017. Twenty two percent (or 416) of municipalities used landfills to dispose of part of their waste and 79 percent (or 1,484) used informal dumpsites (INEI 2019, 448-450). Compared to 2015, however, 2016 and 2017 show increasingly worse waste disposal conditions. In 2015, 1,777 municipalities collected approximately 7.63 million metric tons of waste, which is 95 percent of all 1,842 municipalities found that year (INEI 2016, 422). Yet, regarding disposal, 572 municipalities used landfills (or 31 percent, compared to 23 percent in 2016 and 22 percent in 2017) and 1,278 dumped their trash in open locations (or 69 percent, compared to 79 percent in 2016 and 2017) (INEI 2016, 424). As a result of this declining waste disposal performance over the years, about 5,859 acres of land were deteriorated across 1,585 different locations in 2018 (MINAM 2018). Waste collection services show fewer complications, even improving over time, as 94 more municipalities managed to collect waste at least every other day in 2013 (1,019) relative to 2016 (1,113) (INEI 2015, 2016, 2018). Performance challenges for the delivery of waste disposal, relative to collection services, are hence evident and profound, denoting a puzzling service provision problem that demands deeper evaluation. 2.2 Theoretical Framework 2.2.1 Administrative Capacity Central to adequately tackling environmental sustainability in the Global South is understanding the critical local governance conditions that municipalities currently have, so as to uncover how they might provide more complex services with environmental implications moving forward. On the one hand, limitations in general administrative capacity constitute a significant impediment 26 for municipal performance, particularly in the Global South (Grindle 2007; World Bank 2003). Public administration scholars have shown convincingly that general capacity affects public organizations’ performance (Christensen and Gazley 2008; Ingraham et al. 2003; O'Toole Jr. and Meier 1999). This approach operationalizes capacity through generic measures associated with an agency such as organizational structure; human resource quality, quantity, and empowerment; financial resources; leadership and management characteristics, and; information systems. While the general administrative capacity of a bureaucracy is crucial for service performance, less knowledge exists about service-specific administrative capacity and how it may matter when services increase in complexity. This refers to capacity within the office or unit directly managing and implementing the service. It is critical because, at its core, local service provision is led by the specific municipal unit in charge –– if its capacity is weak, the finance team or the mayor’s office will not take over their duties. Within-unit capacity gains significance as service delivery responsibilities become more complex. Knowing this is essential when comparing the performance of simple waste collection ––a labor-intensive task centered on routine planning–– with complex waste disposal –– which demands specialized technical knowledge and infrastructure. While this study does not attempt to provide a universal definition of service or task complexity, simple and complex services are conceptually differentiated here along three task-related dimensions: managerial and operational, technical knowledge, and cost requirements when comparing services within the same domain, in this case waste management (see Table 2.1 below). In each task dimension, the complex service’s characteristics include components that are more asset-specific compared to the simple service, simultaneously requiring more components. Using definitions from Williamson (1991), physical and human asset specificity are 27 key features of waste service complexity, pertaining the managerial and technical dimensions, respectively, because these resources cannot be easily redirected to other services. Asset specificity and extra service features thus make waste disposal more costly and complex overall. For example, whereas waste collection requires generic management knowledge and no specialized infrastructure, waste disposal needs specific technical expertise on waste treatment and leachate management and specialized infrastructure such as landfills and leachate geomembranes. The provision of collection services entails matching routines with available waste picking personnel and resources that can be organized with a minimal level of planning by municipal managers. However, planning the implementation and management of disposal services’ infrastructures requires more elaborate policy tools and procedural regulations, including skills to manage community participation and social conflict. Differences in cost and human resource needs between both services are also remarkable (Table 2.1). Examining complexity in other services may involve considering different task nuances. 28 Table 2.1.

This partnership, particularly through cogovernance and coproduction, aids decision-making and delivery and is more important in local governments facing multifaceted limitations, which is common in the Global South (Brass 2016; Cheng 2019). However, some research finds that collaboration does not always lead to better service delivery performance. In part, this is due to administrative capacity limitations of local governments, preventing them from implementing participation venues as well as CSOs’ lack of involvement, precluding proper collaboration with the communities needing these services the most (Agranoff 2007; Babiak and Thibault 2009; Brass et al. 2012; Brinkerhoff 2002; Cammett and MacLean 2011; Gazley 2010; Jaramillo and Alcázar 2017; Loeffler and Bovaird 2016; McNulty 2019; Page et al. 2015). Current research, nonetheless, has not assessed the role of collaborative governance on service performance sufficiently, especially when service complexity varies (Voorberg et al. 2015). The studies that examine the relationship between local collaborations and public service performance focus on cogovernance, involving joint planning, designing, budgeting, decision-making in general, and coproduction, which is the joint management, delivery, or evaluation of services (Brinkerhoff and Brinkerhoff 2011; Emerson et al. 2012; Osborne and McLaughlin 2004). The difference between the two is that while local coproduction helps solve immediate implementation issues affecting performance, local cogovernance allows civil society actors to influence more strategic, structural public service matters that drive performance inefficiencies, giving voice to key local service priorities in decision-making processes and serving as critical 30 support for local governments facing multifaceted limitations in the Global South. That is why this dissertation focuses on local cogovernance, particularly the institutionalized venues in which this type of collaboration takes place. 2.2.3 CSO Involvement CSO involvement, which in some cases is a form of coproduction, is important for service provision (Putnam et al. 1993). Yet, this may be true only if the CSOs’ capabilities are pertinent to the service they are engaging with (AbouAssi et al. 2019). Since the provision of services determines the livelihoods and wellbeing of local communities in the Global South, it is natural to expect the involvement of CSOs in service provision to have a crucial role when services are underprovided. Some research finds that civil society involvement improves delivery performance. What is unclear, however, is whether the involvement of any CSO in service provision can help improve performance as services become more complex. While research in political science identifies that service performance is enhanced when a CSO has certain characteristics that suggest CSO strength ––such as being formal, locally rooted, and well managed–– similar organization-level attributes are not addressed enough in the collaborative governance literature, particularly regarding those in the Global South (AbouAssi et al. 2019; Auerbach 2017; Brass 2016; Breslin 1987; Cammett and MacLean 2014). This work signals the role of CSOs’ organizational robustness, underscoring characteristics about the strength of the civic community, as proposed by Putnam et al. (1993), and illustrating the extent to which participating CSOs are formal and locally embedded in their communities. Such qualities are key because they imply that these CSOs are likely more transparent and internally organized, when formal, and have a better understanding of community priorities and solutions 31 and are thus more participatory and legitimate, when rooted locally. Thus, better service performance may not just result from CSOs’ participation in the delivery process but may hinge on specific organizational features (Brinkerhoff and Wetterberg 2016; O'Meally 2013), namely from formal, community-based CSO involvement. These types of CSOs are studied in this dissertation to assess diverging waste service outcomes. Two other mechanisms also help explain the influence CSOs may have on performance, unrelated to their capabilities. While civil society in the Global South tends to organize to demand better services from weak local governments (Alam and Rabbani 2009; Auerbach 2020; Kruks-Wisner 2018; McNulty 2013; Remy 2004), it is possible that poor municipal planning capacity precludes CSO inclusion in service delivery, regardless of CSO strength (de la Riva Agüero 2021). Discrimination may also be a limitation. Because most CSOs and individuals involved in waste are usually informally employed and from vulnerable groups, such as low-income non-white women and their children, they tend to be discriminated against by administrators due to their gender, socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, or the work they do (de la Riva Agüero 2021; Fredericks 2009; Kaza et al. 2018). In a highly ethnically diverse country like Peru, indigenous peoples are relatively more vulnerable to these problems. Systemic discrimination introduces hard barriers to overcome, significantly affecting their individual opportunities for growth and the development of their communities (Hall and Patrinos 2012; Torero et al. 2004). This is likely a critical factor that weakens the organizational strength of indigenous community CSOs and the degree to which they become involved in or influence service provision (Arroyo and Irigoyen 2005; Remy 2004, 130-131). 32 2.3 Conceptualization 2.3.1 Main Outcomes Two measures are used to capture the main outcomes of simple and complex service provision: solid waste collection and solid waste disposal performance. I examine service performance focusing on physical conditions and the extent to which they are provided, which is based on their conceptual definitions in the waste management literature (Abarca-Guerrero et al. 2013; Aleluia and Ferrão 2016; Kaza et al. 2018; Shekdar 2009; UN-Habitat 2010; USAID 2018). Both dependent variables are assessed quantitatively and qualitatively. Collection performance refers to the extent to which waste is collected, assessing whether the streets are clean after waste is gathered. It is operationalized using both quantitative and qualitative data. Quantitative data from panel dataset provides measures on the amount of waste collected and the number of times municipal employees perform the task each week. I also use qualitative data from three comparable case studies to estimate the degree to which the streets are clean or have areas where trash overflows, accumulates, and rots. Changes within and across sites of these conditions during the fieldwork period are also assessed. Collection performance also refers to the territorial coverage, or the extent to which waste is collected throughout the jurisdiction of each municipality, which is also obtained from the three qualitative case studies. It is operationalized by the proportion of the territory that receives this service based on estimates obtained from SSO. Disposal performance, on the other hand, is defined as the degree to which waste is properly disposed of (or not), focusing on the disposal method (i.e., where waste is disposed of) as well as on how this method is managed (i.e., its infrastructure and waste treatment). The proper disposal of waste by municipalities is operationalized quantitatively, using panel data, by 33 calculating the proportion of waste that is properly disposed of in landfills or through recycling or composting relative to non-environmentally sustainable methods. To qualitatively assess proper waste disposal, using fieldwork data from three case studies, I evaluate the infrastructural conditions and treatment of waste in these facilities. Changes on these characteristics during the fieldwork period are also assessed. See Table A2.1 in the appendix below for a summary of the definition of all measures. 2.3.2 Key Determinants Three local governance factors are studied to explain why we observe a discrepancy in the performance of the two waste services studied. The first one is service-specific administrative capacity. It is conceptually defined as the internal administrative capabilities or competences of a (municipal) bureaucracy, at the level of the unit responsible for service management and implementation, that are specifically required for the effective and efficient provision of a particular service to achieve its expected societal outcomes. To operationalize this concept, I use deductive reasoning in accordance with the work of classical organizational theory scholars (Galbraith 2002; Lawrence and Lorsch 1967; Mintzberg 1983; Thompson 1967) and factors identified in current research on general capacity (Andrews 2010; Boyne 2003; Christensen and Gazley 2008; O'Toole Jr. and Meier 1999; Rainey and Steinbauer 1999; World Bank 2003). I also conduct inductive theory-building based on exploratory field research. This combined deductive-inductive approach helps show the differences in the type of administrative capacity necessary for each service. As a result, I measure two internal dimensions of the office providing these services: the degree to which the office or unit is internally specialized and equipped. Specialization refers to having differentiated organizational structure, coordination processes, 34 diagnostic and policy documents, management system, and tasks specific to each service. Equipment denotes having differentiated trained personnel, budget allocation, and operational machinery and infrastructure, specific to each service (see Table A2.1 in the appendix for all measures’ definition). Thus, the operationalization approach of service-specific administrative capacity is informed both deductively, by analyzing existing theory on capacity, as well as inductively, building theory using evidence from exploratory fieldwork. Administrative capacity can range from low to high, depending on the degree to which a municipal bureaucracy office or unit has these features. To quantitatively evaluate this factor, I use a composite index of the variables pertaining specialization of environmental and waste management. The index includes measures on the existence of waste management and environmental management policy instruments, organizational structure, and decision-making space. Service-specific equipment is also assessed through variables on waste collection vehicles and waste disposal equipments. I also gather qualitative data on whether the specialization and equipment components are tailored to a specific waste service, how they are used, processes followed, and the challenges faced. Part of this field-based approach also helps reveal possible causal mechanisms involving the administrative context and stakeholder interactions of the delivery process of each service. The second factor is community-based CSO involvement. It is conceptually defined as whether formally organized civil society groups that are embedded in their community directly participate in the provision of either waste management services at the local level (Bovaird 2007; Cammett and MacLean 2014; Putnam et al. 1993). It is hence deductively informed by the literature. It is centered on the involvement of CSOs with these particular features in waste collection and disposal services. Broadly speaking, these CSOs include organizations such as 35 community-based organizations, neighborhood associations, labor unions, faith-based groups, nongovernmental organizations, among others, if they are formal, rooted in the community, and involved in the provision of the two studied waste services (see Table A2.1 in the appendix for all measures’ definitions). The involved CSOs’ organizational attributes are thus crucial to this concept. Two additional distinctions are incorporated to the definition, however, using inductive reasoning from exploratory fieldwork to identify the occurrence of these CSOs’ involvement more precisely in the Peruvian context. One is about the type of involvement CSOs’ have in waste service provision. Since the country has a national legal mandate establishing that municipalities are the sole responsible government actors of providing waste management services, and that full abandonment of that task is not authorized (MINAM 2017), it is expected that in the cases where CSO involvement occurs it would be to supplement municipal efforts (weak or otherwise) and not to substitute their role to some extent. Unlike well-documented expectations of community organizing for service delivery in cases of government failure and abandonment of its tasks (Batley and Mcloughlin 2010; Brass 2012, 2016; Cammett and MacLean 2011; Nelson-Nuñez 2019; Post et al. 2017), interviews with 28 mayors across diverse types of municipalities and fieldwork in Peru confirms that substitution by CSOs, full or partial, for the provision of these services to assist entire local communities is rare within the jurisdictions that local governments are mandated to cover. This dissertation, therefore, concentrates on the supplementary role of CSOs in waste service provision. This is understood as the complementary or supportive involvement for service provision under the leadership of a municipal office, even in situations in which CSOs are responsible of providing an important portion of a given waste service. As long as CSO participation is conducted in coordination, 36 supervision, and at least partial involvement in solving problems by the responsible municipal office, their role will be regarded as supplementary to that of the municipality in the context of this dissertation. The second key distinction further specifies how CSO involvement is judged as occurring. For the purposes of this study, CSO involvement takes place when waste management tasks are provided by the organization itself or their individual members, and may take place with or without a contract between the organization and the municipality. This way, the delivery of waste services by individual members of a CSO will still classify as CSO involvement as long as the following three conditions exist: First, these individuals are allowed to provide (some aspect of) a waste service by a municipality (contract or not) as a result of their membership to a CSO; second, the municipality treats and regards them as members or representatives of a CSO and not individual, unaffiliated citizens, and; third, the CSOs’ self-governance, social orientation, and societal representation is not altered by any contractual relationship with a municipality (Andrews et al. 2010, 1192-1196; Arnstein 1969, 222; Bovaird 2007, 849-850; Cammett and MacLean 2014, 13-14). What this means is that whether a contract exists or not, with a CSO or its members, is not relevant for the definition of involvement used in this dissertation because the CSO directly leads the service provision process (not its individual members) while maintaining its socially oriented organizational mission and roots. CSO involvement hence occurs, directly, when it participates as an organization or, indirectly, through the participation of their members acting as representatives of the CSO. This clarification is inductively informed by exploratory fieldwork in Peru. For instance, one municipality had a formal agreement with two CSOs to collect and dispose of waste. Yet, due to public sector procurement procedures and internal considerations of the CSO, they 37 decided together with the municipality to, instead, hire their members individually and on a rotational basis. The service would then be provided by the CSOs’ individual members, but the management of the whole process was conducted by the CSOs’ leadership with its members acting as representatives. Using this definition of CSO involvement avoids excluding such cases and other classification errors produced by simply focusing on the type of contractual relationship with a municipality. Accuracy on this definition is crucial for the qualitative part of this dissertation. To operationalize the concept, I use two different variables to quantitatively capture community CSO involvement: first, a composite index of neighborhood-based CSO presence that measures organizational and participation features of neighborhood associations, including variables of whether they are formal, active, participatory, and on their membership size, and; second, the territorial concentration of poverty alleviation CSOs, in terms of their quantity relative to municipal population. Both are formal and locally rooted organizations. Qualitatively, I collect data on CSOs’ organizational characteristics, whether and how they are involved in the provision of each waste service, and challenges for participation. Finally, local collaborative governance broadly refers to multi-stakeholder interactions, usually led by local government authorities, that typically occur in some type of formal space with the purpose of gathering efforts and their unique resources and capabilities to address issues with societal implications that otherwise could not be individually achieved (Bryson et al. 2015; Emerson et al. 2012). However, in this dissertation, I make an important distinction noting that it specifically refers to the local decision-making that mayors, municipal managers, council members, and CSO representatives make, formally and jointly, for planning and budgeting critical policies (Bovaird 2007; Bovaird and Loeffler 2012; Nabatchi et al. 2017). These 38 collaborations are materialized through convenings that are more accurately known as local cogovernance venues as they center on jointly deciding on (as opposed to implementing) critical aspects of local services, including those affecting the provision of key local services such as waste collection and disposal (Brandsen and Pestoff 2006; Cheng 2019; Voorberg et al. 2015) (see Table A2.1 in the appendix for all measures’ definition). Collaborations more generally can take a variety of forms, structured or not, and involve a few or many actors across different levels, sectors, and service stages (i.e. inter-governmental collaborations, cross-sector collaborations, public-private partnerships, coproduction). Yet, the specific form of local collaboration studied here is very relevant for waste management because these are the main venues where joint decision-making between local stakeholders take place and (potentially) tackle structural and strategic elements affecting the performance of its services. This is not to be conflated with the coproduction form that traditionally emphasizes formal or informal collaborations between government and civil society (organized or not) for the direct implementation of services (Bovaird 2007; Bovaird and Loeffler 2012; Brandsen and Honingh 2016; Ostrom 1996). The way CSO involvement is studied here is also distinct from the latter two concepts (i.e., cogovernance and coproduction) because it is not focused on the government-CSO relationship per se but on the organizational characteristics of the CSOs participating in waste service delivery, centered on understanding the role of a specific type of CSO and how its formal, community-rooted nature may influence diverging performance outcomes for the two services studied. To quantitatively assess this concept, given the available data, I construct a composite index of cogovernance, which captures the extent to which a venue such as Local Coordination 39 Councils engage in local planning and budgeting. Local Coordination Councils are formal venues led by the mayor where municipal authorities, managers, council members, and CSO leaders make planning and budgeting decisions for key local policy issues. The index includes measures on Local Coordination Councils’ actions for planning and budgeting as well as on the proportion of civil society and total representatives in the council relative to municipal population. Qualitatively, I collect data on the structure, organization, decision-making processes, policy priorities, and limitations of local cogovernance venues such as Local Coordination Councils and Municipal Environmental Commissions that, among other local environmental issues, are tasked to tackle waste-related problems jointly with municipal and local CSO leaders. 2.4 Methods 2.4.1 Research Design Comparative, Mixed-Methods, and Nested Case Study Research. To assess disparities in waste service provision, this dissertation examines three local governance factors in Peruvian municipalities. Service-specific municipal administrative capacity, community-based CSO involvement, and local collaborative governance are explored as possible drivers of the differential performance observed between waste collection and waste disposal. This research thus uses a “causes of effects” approach (Goertz and Mahoney 2012, 41), where the objective is to understand how an outcome occurred, after deductively identifying the crucial factors from existing research, empirically noticing puzzling results, and inductively building theory on what drives waste service delivery at the local level. 40 The study focuses on Peru but the problems have clear global implications. Recent evidence worldwide shows that municipalities in the Global South perform highly in waste collection but poorly in proper waste disposal (Kaza et al. 2018). This is exemplified in a country like Peru that recently reported having important improvements in municipal waste collection (more municipalities collected 6.6 percent more waste in 2017 compared to 2015) while fewer municipalities used proper disposal methods such as landfills (22 percent in 2017, down from 31 percent in 2015, with 79 percent using open-air dumpsites) (INEI 2019, 448-450). While national-level data classify Peru as an upper-middle income country, based on its national GDP per capita, municipal data reveal wide spatial wealth disparities (Escobal and Torero 2005; World Bank 2005) –– a common characteristic across Global South countries regardless of aggregate GDP levels. Thus, studying Peru’s municipal waste service delivery issues gives us insights into a range of country conditions. To capture these complex empirical phenomena, I use a varied methodological toolkit. I trace both their causal effects and causal mechanisms using a mixed-method strategy to strengthen the internal and external validity, hence improving causal inference (Collier et al. 2010; George and Bennett 2005; Gerring 2017; Hendren et al. 2018; Hendren et al. 2022; Lieberman 2005; Mele and Belardinelli 2019; Ragin 2014; Raudenbush and Sampson 1999; Seawright 2016). One single method cannot accurately approximate understanding of the fundamental question guiding this dissertation. The research design thus consists of a quantitative, regression-based analysis of an original panel dataset and a qualitative, comparative case study approach drawing on intensive fieldwork. The methodologies are mixed and hence equally supplementary to each other in the overall analysis of findings, what is termed nested inference by Collier et al. (2010) or integrative approach by Seawright (2016). The back-and- 41 forth process of evaluating fieldwork and large-N data underscores the reciprocity between the two approaches. However, it also uses a nested analysis approach geared to the selection of fieldwork cases that originates from a large-N quantitative analysis of municipal characteristics from the panel dataset (Lieberman 2005). In the following lines I explain how I used each methodology. Comparative Case Studies: Case Selection. This dissertation examines three medium-sized cities in Peru (see Figure 2.1 below for the map of Peru). Studies on local governance and service provision in the Global South tend to concentrate on large, metropolitan cities, however (Anguelovski et al. 2014; Auerbach 2020; Buntaine et al. 2020; Henry et al. 2006; Herrera 2014; Jaramillo and Alcázar 2017; Kaza et al. 2018; Kumar et al. 2022; Lazzarini et al. 2020; Post 2018; Rai et al. 2019). Although attention to localities of this size is valuable, the unique, outlier characteristics of these contexts ––in terms of better structured and equipped municipal offices, more CSOs with stronger organizational capabilities, and relatively functional local collaborative governance venues–– make them likely unrepresentative of most municipalities and the steep battles that relatively smaller or less resourced municipalities confront to deliver services. Similarly, while generalizability would not be an issue if small-sized municipalities were evaluated due to their extensive presence, small-scale service provision typically entails simplified operations, administrative conditions, and CSO involvement, for instance, that would also limit the ability to obtain sufficient information to learn about key local governance determinants. Focusing on medium-sized local governments thus strengthens generalizability as well as provides a greater chance of more clearly revealing why and how capacity, CSOs, and collaborative governance matter for explaining waste service performance gaps. 42 Figure 2.1. Map of Peru Notes: The white lines are the limits between administrative regions (equivalent to states in the US). The colors represent the three main geographic areas. The coastal areas are colored in white, the mountains in dark grey, and the rainforest in light grey. The case selection strategy is based on assessing possible waste service performance outcomes resulting from a joint analysis of two dimensions. This approach helps control for variations in two main drivers to examine how such changes influence waste service performance disparities. Four possible scenarios are produced (see Diagram 2.1). The two dimensions are municipal waste management administrative capacity and community CSO involvement, which are core elements of local governance for service provision. Waste management capacity can range from low to high and CSO involvement from none or privately- 43 provided outsourced services to the participation of formal and locally embedded CSOs. Since these two factors are also key components of the third determinant evaluated in this dissertation, local collaborative governance (AbouAssi et al. 2019; Ostrom 1996), focusing on the former two likely reflects some key conditions in the latter, thus supporting the decision to examine the two indicated dimensions as part of the case selection strategy. Given these characteristics, municipal capacity and CSO involvement are critical for the identification of sets of municipalities that would fit in possible combinations of varied levels between the two dimensions. Of the resulting four categories only three were the matter of this dissertation, selecting one municipal case study for each from a sample of comparable provincial municipalities. The categories represented three different combinations of different levels of waste management administrative capacity and community CSO involvement locally: • High waste administrative capacity –– High CSO involvement • Low waste administrative capacity –– High CSO involvement • Low waste administrative capacity –– Low CSO involvement 44 Diagram 2.1. Case Selection Model Notes: The three highlighted boxes represent the categories used for case selection. The remaining category, high waste administrative capacity –– low CSO involvement, was left out. Two important reasons explain this decision, based on what is hypothesized in this dissertation. First, it is expected that both services would perform equally well in municipal cases with high administrative capacity that seemingly do not need CSO participation, which is no longer within the scope of the puzzle of this dissertation. Second, not observing CSO involvement in service provision would provide insufficient insights about the role of core elements of local governance in waste service disparities. Once the dimensions and categories were correctly mapped, I identified the criteria that would help ensure contextual similarity and comparability across cases before deciding upon specific localities. Thus, these criteria needed to be unrelated to measures of administrative capacity or CSO involvement. The reason is that it was necessary for these two key dimensions to vary across cases to assess waste service performance differences based on the case selection strategy summarized in Diagram 2.1. To do so, I held constant population size, to account for 45 corresponding administrative and service delivery demands; poverty level, as a proxy of wealth and socioeconomic conditions, and; ecological location and altitude, to control for similar exposure to weather and rainfall patterns that influence waste service provision. Using data from the panel dataset, I analyzed population size, poverty level, and ecological location and altitude to obtain a smaller group of comparable municipalities. Most importantly, the size of the population had to be large relative to most municipalities in the country to capture cases with greater local activity, considering that the average population size of all municipalities is quite small, of approximately 16,842 people.10 Only municipalities with populations between 30,000 and 70,000, or between the 90th and 95th percentiles, hence remained. To include more typical cases, I excluded municipalities within Metropolitan Lima due to their size and outlier characteristics. For socioeconomic conditions and wealth at the local level, I looked at poverty levels. Only municipalities one standard deviation (17 percentage points) above and below the mean municipal poverty of 35 percent (in 2018) were kept.11 These are municipalities with 18 to 42 percent of their population living in poverty. Regarding ecological context and altitude, a key criterion was whether a municipality was from the coast or not, since coastal municipalities are not only relatively larger in size and wealthier but also experience very different weather patterns of rain relative to the rest of the country. This was also observed in my statistical analyses, showing that coastal cities performed statistically significantly different –– and many times better–– in the performance of some waste services compared to those in all other geographic locations. Coastal municipalities were thus excluded, keeping only those from all other ecological locations and altitudes. 10 Average population at the municipal level calculated using 2018 data. Considers all municipalities in Peru. 11 The poverty level used includes all municipalities except those in Metropolitan Lima. 46 To find cases within the resulting group of municipalities that would fit into the three categories prioritized, I used the waste management administrative capacity index and the neighborhood association index created from the quantitative dataset. The waste capacity index captures the existence of waste and environmental management organizational and policy specialization on waste. On the other hand, the neighborhood association index measures organizational and participation characteristics of these locally embedded CSOs. These indices’ averages were evaluated to find high and low levels of capacity and CSO involvement.12 The availability of variables capturing direct CSO participation in waste services presented some limitations, however. The neighborhood association index captures the presence of this type of CSOs locally, but not the actual involvement in waste management. To more precisely identify municipalities where CSO participation in waste was low or high ––and to further narrow down the set of possible cases–– I directly contacted a set of municipalities that fit into the categories using all the measures discussed above. Reaching out was important not only to have better and more detailed information on CSO involvement but also on waste management administrative capacity. Before going to the field, it was critical to accurately determine the set of cases that were the best fit for each category. As a result, between January and May 2021, I held 28 phone interviews via WhatsApp with mayors and municipal managers, ranging from 20 to 60 minutes depending on their availability. I collected information about the organizational and administrative characteristics of waste management offices (including the environmental office, to which it usually belongs), the type of involvement of community CSOs in waste management, and main challenges faced to provide waste collection and disposal. 12 Means for municipalities with population 30,000≤x≤70,000: waste management administrative capacity index: 1.014731; neighborhood association index: 0.4144798; waste collection vehicles per square mile: 0.5150438; waste disposal equipment per 1,000 people in each municipality: 0.0495041. All use 2018 data and exclude municipalities in Metropolitan Lima due to their outlier characteristics. 47 The rich qualitative data gathered before fieldwork supplemented these quantitative data limitations, significantly strengthening the case selection strategy. Three municipal cases were finally chosen for their precise fit in one of the three categories. They were the provincial municipalities of Bagua Grande, in the Amazonas Region (northern rainforest); Satipo, in the Junin Region (central rainforest), and; Sicuani, in the Cusco Region (southern Andes) (see Table 2.2 below for information on their characteristics and Figure 2.2 for their locations). 48 Table 2.2.

Notes: The contextual factors are criteria used to control for overall comparability of the cases. The key dimensions show some characteristics related to administrative capacity and CSO involvement that are allowed to vary to study the differences in waste service performance outcomes. Data on the means and standard deviations are for all municipalities that have populations between 30,000 and 70,000, excluding those in Metropolitan Lima for their outlier features. For the mayoral vote share, the 2014-2015 elections were used because they are the most recent data on elections available in the panel dataset created for this dissertation. The last column accounts for the size of one standard deviation of each measure. 13 The value of the neighborhood association index in Sicuani is low, which is one main reason why I conducted WhatsApp phone interviews before fieldwork. The issue with this variable is that it captures the presence of neighborhood associations, not their actual involvement in waste management. 49 These are similar and comparable cases of municipalities in contextual dimension such as socioeconomic, ecological, certain political and administrative characteristics, as shown in Table 2.2. However, they differ in the key dimensions used for the case selection strategy. For example, for administrative capacity, the average municipal final budget per capita ––a measure of general capacity–– in 2018 is USD 367.64 and one standard deviation equals USD 306.44. The average waste management budget spent per capita ––a measure of specific capacity–– in 2018 is USD 13.69 and one standard deviation equals USD 16.10. These statistics show that Satipo has general capacity levels almost within one standard deviation above the mean while Bagua Grande and Sicuani are within one standard deviation below, although they differ significantly in specific capacity. Thus, the municipality of Satipo is similar to Bagua Grande and Sicuani in general capacity, while Satipo has better specific administrative capacity compared to the other two. For CSO involvement, Bagua Grande and Sicuani have higher numbers of CSOs and CSO concentration than Satipo but are roughly within one standard deviation from the mean. These similarities ––in contextual dimensions–– and differences ––in key dimensions–– are accounted for case selection purposes, with additional data on their characteristics obtained through the WhatsApp interviews to increase accuracy. 50 Figure 2.2. Location of the three Case Studies Notes: The three municipal case studies are colored in black. The provinces they are part of are in dark grey, encompassing the three municipalities. 2.4.2 Analysis Quantitative Panel Data. To test the hypotheses, this dissertation uses a unique panel dataset of all 1,874 Peruvian municipalities covering the years 2014, 2016, and 2018. It uses two-way fixed effects regression methods to identify how variations in municipal waste management administrative capacity, formal and locally embedded CSO presence, and cogovernance for municipal planning and budgeting affect waste collection and proper waste disposal performance, controlling for general capacity and political, socioeconomic, and geographic factors. Details on the variables and models are provided in Chapter 3. The panel uses municipal- 51 level data from multiple Peruvian public sector agencies such as the Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Finance, National Jury of Elections, National Statistics Institute, and the Strategic Planning National Center (see Table A2.2 for specific variables and sources and Table A2.3 to find the links to the original datasets in this chapter’s appendix). I received personal guidance and support from public servants in some of these agencies, making a significant difference in obtaining access to datasets when it became difficult due to format or download issues. For transparency and replication of the data analysis, it is important to describe how the new dataset was built. Each year’s data was downloaded from its original source (Table A2.3 in the appendix). Then, the relevant variables were identified and cleaned, renamed, recoded, and labeled to standardize the code across the three years used. After standardizing the coding, the annual datasets from the same source were merged. The final merging of all the eight sources was completed once all datasets were cleaned and merged. The merging process was performed using the municipality identification number, or ubigeo in Spanish, which is a unique number officially assigned to each municipality. A major issue in this process was the inconsistency in some variables’ original coding, question structure, and categories. An example is the waste collection quantity variable of the National Registry of Municipalities, which had a categorical variable for its 2014 data but a continuous variable for 2016 and 2018. This issue needed a detailed variable examination. This work produced a unique dataset from eight publicly available secondary sources. 52 Qualitative Case Study Research and Data Collection.14 The qualitative approach provides in-depth information about three municipal cases. This way, it was possible to zoom in to specific organizational characteristics of municipal waste offices, community CSOs’ features and involvement in the provision of each service, and the structure and decision-making processes of local collaborative governance venues regarding waste. Likewise, detailed data was gathered on both waste services’ performance in each jurisdiction, getting a close grasp on waste actually collected from the streets and the conditions and activities at disposal, recycling, and composting sites. With this case study evidence, I trace whether and how these local governance factors help account for performance differentials between waste collection and waste disposal. This information is not available in the panel dataset and thus adds valuable evidence regarding the conditions and causal mechanisms leading to performance disparities in waste services. Between the months of June and September 2021 I conducted 94 interviews with 118 people including municipal authorities, waste management personnel, and CSO members; 28 ethnographic observations of waste service sites, service delivery processes, and CSO meetings; 114 systematic social observations of representative parts of each municipality across multiple days, to assess the performance of waste collection and disposal, and; a review of municipal diagnostic and policy documents to supplement the information gathered. Phone interviews with 28 mayors and municipal managers were also carried out between January and May 2021 to obtain an overview of local governance and waste service issues, detailed information for case selection, and establish local contacts before going to the field. Exploratory interviews and ethnographic observations on the same topic were carried out from June to August 2018 in four Peruvian municipalities. They provided foundational evidence for the questions, hypotheses, 14 Indiana University’s IRB approved this fieldwork under protocol # 2006003944. 53 research design, and findings of this dissertation. In the following lines, I present details on the data collection process of determinant and outcome variables as well as on case selection. The data collection techniques I used to gather qualitative evidence on the key variables were semi-structured interviews, participant and direct observations, and secondary source analysis (national and municipal policy documents). In the following lines I provide details on how each technique was used. Interviews.15 Semi-structured interviews covered topics such as organizational features and resources of waste offices and CSOs; waste service management procedures and challenges; workers’ sentiments about their waste-related jobs; CSOs and cogovernance venues’ membership, internal decision-making, and involvement in waste services, and; local political priorities. Other topics were also discussed depending on respondents’ concerns and experiences. I selected respondents by formally requesting the support of the municipal Environmental Office manager as well as through snowball sampling. Before going to the field, I had 28 preliminary phone interviews with them were they verbally agreed to support my research. This was followed by a formal letter submitted to the municipality with details on my visit. My first interview or conversation in each locality was with the head of this office or directly with the Waste Management Suboffice manager if advised by the Environmental Office manager. I did this to respect the organizational hierarchy and avoid misunderstandings that would complicate 15 Interviews sources are cited in the following format: Int-XX-##. The “XX” section represents two letters to indicate the city and the “##” section provides the interview number conducted in that city. “BG” is used for Bagua Grande, “SI” for Sicuani, and “SA” for Satipo. The same citation structure and city codes are used for sources from ethnographic observations and systematic social observations, replacing only the first portion to identify the type of method used to obtain the data. This coding is deliberately used to honor the requirements of confidentiality of the Office of Research Compliance of Indiana University. 54 my interactions in each city. These managers would then refer me to other important actors. In turn, interviewees also connected me with other relevant individuals and organizations. Ethnographic Methods.16 Participant and direct observations focused on how municipal workers and CSOs carried out their waste service routines and operations, noticing unspoken challenges in their activities as part of the final stages of delivery. Observations also captured how some CSOs discussed their most pressing concerns and reached decisions, giving a closer understanding about their internal organizational management, involvement in waste, and interaction with the municipality. Since there were no meetings of local collaborative governance venues during my visits, I was unable to observe how these were carried out, key topics discussed, and the overall management of their convenings. Thus, all the information on local collaborative governance venues came from the interviews. One fieldwork research assistant helped document observations pertaining the independent variables after receiving training on the concepts and in the field. We used open-ended guiding questions to help direct our attention to these aspects. Systematic Social Observation.17 To examine performance, I used direct observation, particularly systematic social observation (SSO), to learn about the dependent variables regarding the physical characteristics and extent of provision of waste collection and waste 16 Ethnographic observation sources are cited in the following format: Ethno-XX-##. The “XX” represents two letters to indicate the city. The “##” section provides the number of each ethnographic observation (per site, activity, or event) conducted in that city. 17 Systematic social observations are cited in the following format: SSO-SERV-XX-##. The “XX” represents two letters to indicate the city. The “##” section provides the number of each SSO visit conducted in that city. In the case of collection services, the “##” section changes to “##_#” with the “_#” portion indicating the sector of the city where the observation was conducted. The “SERV” section of this format represents the first letters of the type of waste service, where “COLL” is used for collection, “DISP” for final disposal at the dump or landfill, “COMP” for composting, and “RECYC” for recycling. 55 disposal services (see Figure 3 below for the SSO questionnaire used in this dissertation). Systematic social observation is a technique largely used in sociology to collect standardized and precise quantifiable data from observations that can be replicated across different sites or events. Structured protocols are at the core of the replicability of this technique. Its core features allowed the gathering of detailed comparable results over time and in all three locations, which is why its use was so relevant to evaluate the outcome variables (Baggetta and Bredenkamp 2021; Fulton and Baggetta 2021; Raudenbush and Sampson 1999; Reiss 1971). The implementation of SSOs across the three cities required the support of the same fieldwork research assistant. An environmental engineer with work experience on municipal waste management in Peru was selected. Her main tasks were to help plan the data collection routines and gather data on the dependent variables in the three localities using the SSO technique. Previous knowledge on waste issues was critical to inform ethnographic observations about issues and patterns otherwise unnoticeable to the untrained eye. However, all observations were documented and described as they occurred. She received training on the contents, meaning, and objectives of the questionnaires as well as how to conduct the technique before going to the field. While in the field, I walked with her during the first few rounds in each locality’s sectors to identify and clarify any doubts or address unexpected problems. To obtain data on waste collection, each municipality was divided in two to four sectors, depending on the territorial size. Since each city has commercial and residential areas of different sizes distributed across different parts, this segmentation was necessary to capture representative samples of waste activity in the streets, making sure that each sector included areas with most residents and commercial activities as well as less populated ones. To organize each sector, we numbered each block on our routes and only collected data from our right side to 56 avoid duplication in the data collected. Each walk lasted for about one hour and a half. Walks were carried out two times a day for three alternate days in each sector, for a total of six walks per sector. Daily walks were done before waste collectors and street sweepers took to the streets and after they concluded their activities to have before and after data that would reveal daily performance changes within and across sectors in a municipality, and for comparison between municipalities. Implementing this process required detailed planning, involving the use accurate maps showing blocks, streets, and neighborhoods to determine the sectors and routes. Maps were requested to waste management suboffices who kindly supported us with the electronic or printed copies. Planning meetings with waste management personnel in each municipality were key to obtain information on the specific schedules and routes of waste collection teams before starting our work. To avoid personal safety risks, the research assistant and I identified the specific locations of the most insecure areas with their help and had a fieldwork policy of only walking though those areas together. These data gathering procedures allowed me to obtain precise, quantifiable evidence on the extent to which waste was collected by block and sector: block characteristics, pre- and post-collection conditions, changes in the proportion of waste collected, streets and neighborhoods receiving better services, and patterns of specific problems burdening waste collection in the streets. To gather waste disposal data, each site ––whether it was for final dumping, recycling, or composting–– was divided into their core activities and each activity was assigned a number. This type of segmentation was necessary to more precisely document patterns and changes throughout each visit since these facilities’ operations are carried out in large areas with markedly different conditions and tasks. Final dumping locations, such as landfills and informal dumpsites, were organized by well-defined holes or portions of areas were waste was regularly 57 or irregularly dumped. Recycling and composting are performed in more or less sequential processes, so they were separated into their core routines. All these facilities were visited two times a week during our 30-day stays in each municipality, for a total of eight visits per facility. Observations lasted for one to two hours, walking around the area while taking detailed notes about each identified hole or section, for landfills and dumpsites, or each task, for recycling and composting sites. Three questionnaires were developed, one for each type of facility and were used in all three municipalities. They included SSO questions, to quantify the sites’ observable infrastructural conditions and resources, as well as open sections to document ethnographic observations on the sequential activities carried out during each visit as well as noticeable issues and patterns of unusual events. To unpack and assess waste disposal performance, it was important to understand the process through which activities were carried out at each site as was registering their conditions over time. Secondary Source Analysis. Policy and operational documents were obtained from municipalities for further analysis of specifics on how each waste service’s relative operations were planned, monitored, and evaluated. National policy documents were also consulted. Scope Conditions. The scope conditions of the theories and research design outlined in this chapter are few: medium-sized cities defined by weak local government capacity, CSOs challenged by poverty, limited local collaborations, and service provision problems. This describes developing democracies in low- and middle-income countries in the Global South. 58 2.5 Conclusions This chapter discusses the puzzle, theory, conceptualization, and methodology that support the analysis conducted in this dissertation. The major theories are included in this chapter, but a more extensive literature review is also provided in the chapters dedicated to each local governance factor. The rationale justifying the data collection techniques and case selection strategy used to conduct a comparative case study is also explained in detail in this chapter.

Definition of Measures Measures Definition Methodology Data Collection Method Main Outcomes Collection performance Extent to which waste is collected, assessing whether the streets are clean after waste is gathered. Quantitative and qualitative. Panel dataset, SSO. Disposal performance Degree to which waste is properly disposed of, focusing on the disposal method (i.e., where waste is disposed of) as well as on how this method is managed (i.e., its infrastructure and waste treatment). Quantitative and qualitative. Panel dataset, SSO. Key Determinants Service-specific administrative capacity Internal administrative capabilities or competences of a (municipal) bureaucracy, at the level of the unit responsible for service management and implementation, that are specifically required for the effective and efficient provision of a particular service to achieve its expected societal outcomes. Specialization Differentiated organizational structure, coordination processes, diagnostic and policy documents, management system, and tasks, specific to each service. Quantitative and qualitative. Panel dataset, interviews, ethnography. Equipment Differentiated trained personnel, budget allocation, and operational machinery and infrastructure, specific to each service. Vehicles for waste collection are: dump truck (camión volquete), compactor truck (camión compactador), stakebed truck (camión baranda), tricycle, and; cargo motor tricycle (motocarguera). Vehicles for waste disposal are: backhoe loader (cargador frontal or retroexcavadora), excavator (excavadora), skid steer loader (minicargador), track loader (cargador oruga), tanker truck (camión cisterna), and dump truck. Quantitative and qualitative. Panel dataset, interviews, ethnography. Community-based CSO involvement Formally organized civil society groups that are embedded in their community that directly participate in the provision of either waste management services at the local level. Includes community-based organizations, neighborhood associations, labor unions, faith-based groups, nongovernmental organizations, among others. Quantitative and qualitative. Panel dataset, interviews, ethnography. Local collaborative governance Multi-stakeholder interactions, usually led by local government authorities, that typically occur in some type of formal space with the purpose of gathering efforts and their unique resources and capabilities to address issues with societal implications that otherwise could not be individually achieved Only quantitative.

However, in the Global South, it is more likely to have clean streets with most waste collected than properly disposed of waste that is treated or not overflowing (de la Riva Agüero 2021; Kaza et al. 2018). In addition to its sanitary consequences, inadequately managed waste also generates a highly pollutant GhG and obstructs drains and sewages that aggravate the damages from extreme rainfall and flooding. This situation disproportionately affects municipalities with weak local governance capabilities to address complex service implementation needs, facing constant climate change-related threats (IPCC 2015). Limitations in general administrative capacity, such as overall structure, human and financial resources, managerial experience and education, and information systems, constitute a significant impediment for municipal performance, particularly in the Global South (Christensen and Gazley 2008; Grindle 2007; Ingraham et al. 2003; O'Toole Jr. and Meier 1999; Rainey and Steinbauer 1999). However, less knowledge exists about service-specific administrative capacity, at the office level, and how it may matter when services increase in relative complexity. Similarly, it is unclear whether the presence of organized civil society groups and cogovernance for local planning and budgeting can help improve performance as services become more complex. Understanding how municipal administrative capacity, civil society organizations (CSO), and cogovernance influence the delivery of services of relatively distinct complexity is thus crucial. This article suggests more nuanced analyses of service performance and a deeper 18 This chapter was originally published in my 2022 article \"Do Cogovernance and CSOs Supplement Municipal Capacity for Service Delivery? An Assessment of Differences in Simple Versus Complex Services.\" Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory 32(1): 1-22. I include it here with permission from Oxford University Press in agreement with their policies for reuse in dissertations. 74 assessment of administrative capacity. Examining these three factors may also guide practitioners concerned about the performance of relatively complex services on the set of measures that they could strategically prioritize in challenging contexts with limited resources. The waste sector is relevant to examine this question for several reasons. Waste management is a critical municipal responsibility that has multiple social and economic implications. When it fails, it generates public health and disease control problems; lowers property value and private investment; and, exposes municipal employees, usually low-income women, to risk (Akinbile and Yusoff 2011; UN-Habitat 2010). Waste management also has climate change mitigation and adaptation consequences. It produces methane, a GhG, from poor collection, disposal, incineration, and management that is significantly more contaminant than carbon dioxide (Ackerman 2000; IPCC 2007, 212; UNEP 2010). Poorly managed waste in cities experiencing heavy rain and flooding associated with climate change can also obstruct drainage and sewage systems and destroy dumpsites, landfills, and other vital waste infrastructure, all of which worsen flooding and related damages (Douglas et al. 2009; Kaza et al. 2018, 119). Vulnerability to environmental disasters is further aggravated by the outcomes of waste mismanagement and poor local governance (Satterthwaite et al. 2009). Not all waste management services are equally intricate. Each entails specific types of administrative capacity, CSOs, and cogovernance. This is especially observed in the developing world where it is harder for municipalities to provide waste management services of relatively greater complexity, such as properly disposing of waste in landfills or through recycling, composting, or treatment, vis-à-vis relatively more simple ones, such as waste collection from the streets (Kaza et al. 2018). In practice, this translates into sufficiently clean streets, but at the same time waste dumped in informal open holes with no control or treatment. To assess this 75 puzzle, this study examines Peruvian municipalities using panel data methods, asking the following principal question: Could service-specific municipal administrative capacity explain differences in performance between relatively simple and complex services? Two secondary research questions are also addressed: Could the presence of formal, locally embedded CSOs produce similar performance disparities between services varying in relative complexity? Is local cogovernance another important driver of performance discrepancies? This research helps advance knowledge on local governance and complex service delivery in the Global South. It engages with research on administrative capacity, CSO presence, local cogovernance, service provision, and waste management in public administration and political science. It contributes to this literature by, first, looking beyond general capacity measures to focus on service-specific administrative capacity; second, differentiating service complexity and their relative performance; third, examining whether and how service-specific administrative capacity, CSO presence, and community cogovernance influence performance when service complexity increases; and, fourth, analyzing how these three governance factors matter for public services with clear climate change implications in Global South municipalities. I theorize that while improvements in municipal waste management administrative capacity and local CSO presence support simple service performance, such as waste collection, only more robust waste management administrative capacity, and not CSO presence, helps increase complex service performance, such as waste disposal. Cogovernance for local planning and budgeting should also theoretically raise simple and complex service performance. The results confirm the expectations about the role of administrative capacity and CSOs but partially on cogovernance. 76 3.1 Literature Review and Hypotheses 3.1.1 Administrative Capacity Scholars have shown convincingly that administrative capacity affects public organizations’ performance (Andrews 2010; Avellaneda 2009, 2012; Bello-Gómez 2020; Boyne 2003; Christensen and Gazley 2008; Fernandez 2004; Fernandez and Moldogaziev 2013; Grindle 2007; Ingraham et al. 2003; Nicholson-Crotty and O'Toole Jr. 2004; O'Toole Jr. and Meier 1999, 2003; Olvera and Avellaneda 2019; Rainey and Steinbauer 1999; World Bank 2003). This research focuses on general administrative capacity, operationalizing it through measures of organizational structure; human resource quality, quantity, and empowerment; personnel stability; available financial resources; leadership characteristics; managerial outputs and public managers’ experience and educational attainment; and, information systems. These factors represent general administrative features of a public agency. While the general administrative capacity of a bureaucracy is crucial for service performance, limited research has examined how the administrative capacity within the office or unit directly managing and implementing the service matters for performance, especially as service delivery responsibilities become relatively more complex. Research on administrative capacity and service delivery, in both developed and developing countries, leaves unnoticed the degree to which relevant offices within a bureaucracy are sufficiently specialized and equipped to deliver specific services. Not understanding these distinctions reduces our knowledge about how this type of service-specific administrative capacity matters when analyzing services’ performance, particularly if a municipal office can provide simple services but largely fails to provide relatively more complex ones. 77 Thus, it is crucial to examine municipal waste offices’ internal conditions to learn about the direct impact of administrative capacity within the waste management team on the performance of services of different complexity. This information can be gathered at the office or unit level by looking at the administrative resources available, how appropriate or specialized these resources are for a specific service, and how they ultimately influence that service’s performance, as classical organizational theory suggests (Galbraith 2002; Lawrence and Lorsch 1967; Mintzberg 1983; Thompson 1967). Features of organizational structure and procedures –– including office or unit specialization in relation to tasks–– as well as their resources, may thus be critical for performance. The evidence raises questions about how much complexity municipal bureaucracies are capable of handling when delivering a service, such as waste disposal, in a context that increasingly requires them to do so urgently and efficiently. For instance, in Peru, 60% of all 1,874 municipalities perform waste collection activities each day or every other day at a minimum, but 70% improperly dispose of it using informal open-air dump sites (MINAM 2016; INEI 2015). Differences between waste collection and disposal services are observed throughout the developing world (Kaza et al. 2018). It may not be accurate to assume that services provided by a given public agency sharing the same administrative and governance capabilities, and managed by the same unit, will experience equal performance levels. Since services vary in complexity, their performance will likely be commensurate to unit capabilities. Therefore, examining conditions and processes within municipal units is essential to understand whether the available administrative capacity is sufficient to adequately provide services regardless of their complexity (Lawrence and Lorsch 1967; Mintzberg 1983; Thompson 1967). 78 This classical, applied approach to administrative capacity centered on the within-unit service-specific administrative capacity is often overlooked by current approaches to the study of administrative capacity and performance, waste management, and climate action in a context of increasing environmental threats (Anguelovski et al. 2014; Hawkins et al. 2016; Krause et al. 2016; Krause et al. 2019). Additionally, the challenges of climate change and its associated uncertainties are likely to aggravate already existing limitations in municipalities, including deeply embedded administrative structural and operational weaknesses. Contrasting the performance of waste services with different complexity and examining their corresponding administrative capacity is, therefore, a necessary contribution. The first hypothesis suggests that: H1: Administrative capacity specific to waste management is positively associated with improvements in both waste collection performance (i.e., a simple service) and proper waste disposal performance (i.e., a complex service). 3.1.2 CSO Presence While scholars have found that service performance is also enhanced with CSOs’ actions (Auerbach 2017, 2020; Cammett and MacLean 2014; Jaramillo and Wright 2015) further research is necessary to elucidate if these improvements are possible when services increase in relative complexity. In the Global South, mainly in cities with less state presence and greater vulnerabilities, civil society tends to participate in public issues through an array of mechanisms by organizing and demanding better services from local governments (Auerbach 2020; Kruks-Wisner 2018; McNulty 2013; Remy 2004). In the case of waste, stakeholders discuss and 79 organize local action regarding service issues, including taking part in the sweeping, recycling, and disposing of waste (UN-Habitat 2010; USAID 2018). Yet, improvements in service performance may not just result from the action of any CSO but may depend on specific CSO features (O'Meally 2013). Some research finds that adequate service delivery is more likely when civil society is organizationally strong, participatory, and rooted in the context in which it operates (Batley 2006; Brass 2016; Cammett and MacLean 2014; Devas and Grant 2003; Putnam et al. 1993; Robinson and White 1997). This may be crucial for municipalities with high poverty levels, regardless of the number of non-state actors present (Torpey-Saboe 2015). The outcomes and relationship types, however, may depend on the service sector, objectives, context, and extent of the involvement of civil society actors, and how government (or elite interest) reacts to their presence (Coston 1998; Jaramillo and Alcázar 2017; Nelson-Nuñez 2019). Thus, there are no guarantees that civil society alone will enhance delivery outcomes, especially for the most vulnerable sectors and if the most connected and wealthy are more proactively engaged (Beall 2001; Devas and Grant 2003; Grillos 2017; Jaramillo and Alcázar 2013; McNulty 2013; Sheely 2015). This means that simply examining participation will not directly elucidate questions regarding civil society’s influence on service delivery. In line with the argument of Putnam et al. (1993) on the civic community, to better understand whether and how CSOs affect service delivery it is necessary to assess the presence of CSOs that are formal and embedded in their context. Their presence can be important in two ways: first, a CSO that is formal likely has more transparent and established administrative, membership, and operational norms and protocols, enhancing the efficiency of its actions; and, second, a locally embedded CSO tends to have a greater understanding of its community’s priorities and how to address them 80 effectively, which may increase its commitment and societal engagement, improving its representation and legitimizing its actions (Cammett and MacLean 2014; Jaramillo and Wright 2015; Putnam et al. 1993). The presence of CSOs with such characteristics is expected to facilitate influence and organized collective action, which are crucial to address public service issues (Auerbach 2017; Ostrom 1990; Putnam et al. 1993). For instance, formal and locally-based CSOs, such as neighborhood associations or community-based poverty alleviation organizations, may be more effective at articulating and strategically demanding municipal offices to address community priorities of better public services or, alternatively, at directly taking charge of the problem through organized collective action. This benefits the service receiving attention, usually the one considered more salient, which may in turn generate performance differences with other services. While CSO influence on service delivery performance may depend on the group’s characteristics, service performance might also be contingent on the relative complexity of the service itself, regardless of the CSO’s characteristics. Therefore, this study challenges the assumption that the effect on service performance of CSO presence remains unchanged even if the complexity of a service varies. The second hypothesis posits: H2: The presence of formal and locally-embedded CSOs is positively associated with improvements in waste collection performance (i.e., a simple service) but is not associated with increased proper waste disposal performance (i.e., a complex service). 81 3.1.3 Cogovernance for Local Planning and Budgeting When governments (national or local) fail to provide essential services adequately, non-state actors organize at the local or community levels to collaborate with municipal bureaucracies to find a way to provide needed services (Brass 2012; Cammett and MacLean 2011; Post et al. 2017). To understand these interactions, the collaborative governance literature focuses on the study of collaboration characteristics, determinants of collaboration and coproduction outcomes, civil society involvement types and their relationship with state agencies (Ansell and Gash 2018; Austin 2000; Bovaird 2007; Bryson et al. 2006, 2015; Cheng 2019b; Loeffler and Bovaird 2016; Mcloughlin 2011; Nelson-Nuñez 2019; Selsky and Parker 2005; Zambrano‐Gutiérrez et al. 2017). However, understanding the interaction between bureaucracies and CSOs also requires examining how collaborative governance may explain service performance in general, on the one hand, as well as performance differences when contrasting services of different complexity, on the other. Exploring this distinction is crucial because many studies in public administration on collaborative governance, particularly cogovernance and coproduction, do not concentrate on service performance outcomes or discuss why it matters, less so when services vary in complexity (Cheng 2019a; Voorberg et al. 2015). Some research does explore a range of governance relationships between multiple government levels and civil society to understand performance (Batley 2006, 2011; Brinkerhoff and Brinkerhoff 2011; Brinkerhoff 2002; Denhardt and Denhardt 2015; Emerson et al. 2012; McGuire 2006; Osborne and McLaughlin 2004; Ostrom 1996). However, others study local collaborations and their implications on public service performance, which, in practice, generally occur when both paid public employees and (usually unpaid) service users (individuals or groups) make significant, active, and explicit joint contributions to the cogovernance (i.e. 82 planning, designing, budgeting, or decision-making in general) or coproduction (i.e. managing, delivering, or evaluating) of public services locally (Bovaird 2007; Bovaird and Loeffler 2012; Brandsen and Honingh 2016; Brandsen and Pestoff 2006, 497; Brass 2016; Cheng 2019a, 205; Nabatchi et al. 2017, 771; Nabatchi et al. 2016; Osborne et al. 2013; Ostrom 1996; Voorberg et al. 2015). While local coproduction may help solve immediate implementation issues affecting performance, local cogovernance may allow civil society actors to influence more strategic and structural public service matters that also drive performance inefficiencies. Having a voice in the discussion and agreement processes of local government service deliberations is key to ensure that societal needs are prioritized. The delivery of services with direct societal implications, like waste collection and disposal, may benefit from local cogovernance relationships between a municipal government and civil society groups, where the latter participates in some aspect of the planning, designing, and thus decision-making of local policy measures and participatory budgeting plans. This interaction is expected to be particularly crucial in local governments facing multifaceted limitations for public service provision, which is common in the Global South. Thus, this article examines local cogovernance for planning and budgeting. Some research finds contrary evidence, indicating that this form of local collaboration does not always lead to better service delivery performance. In part, it is due to administrative capacity limitations of municipal governments, preventing them from setting up proper participation venues and mechanisms to incorporate societal voices. Another reason is CSOs’ lack of involvement and representation. These are two key factors that tend to preclude proper cogovernance with the communities needing these services the most (Brass et al. 2012; Brinkerhoff 2002; Cammett and MacLean 2011; Jaramillo and Alcázar 2017; Loeffler and 83 Bovaird 2016; McNulty 2019). However, since cogovernance is expected to allow CSOs to voice some priorities at the decision-making table, in one way or another, this collaboration form should increase the likelihood that issues that would otherwise go unaddressed ––due to their complexity or lack of salience–– receive adequate attention, ultimately influencing service performance. Third hypothesis proposes: H3: Cogovernance for municipal planning and budgeting is positively associated with performance improvements in both waste collection and proper disposal services. 3.2 Data and Methods Details on the quantitative panel dataset are provided in section 2.4.2 of Chapter 2. 3.2.1 Dependent Variables The two dependent variables measure solid waste collection and solid waste disposal performance, as suggested in the waste management literature (Abarca-Guerrero et al. 2013; UN-Habitat 2010; USAID 2018). Collection performance is evaluated through the extent to which waste is collected, examining whether the streets are clean after waste is gathered. This is operationalized in two ways. One, collection frequency, which is the number of times waste is collected from the streets. It reflects the frequency, in days per week, in which collection routines are deployed around the municipality to gather waste from households and public spaces. Two, the quantity of waste 84 collected by the municipality, which is operationalized by the reported average amount of waste collected, in metric tons per day, per 1,000 people.19 Disposal performance is defined as the degree to which waste is properly disposed of. Proper disposal performance is operationalized by adding the percent of waste disposed of in landfills, or through recycling, composting, or treatment methods, out of the total waste disposed of by each municipality annually. Improper disposal methods include dumping waste on informal open-air holes and burning. 3.2.2 Independent Variables Three independent variables of interest are waste management administrative capacity, the presence of formal and locally embedded CSOs, and cogovernance for municipal planning and budgeting. Waste management administrative capacity refers to a municipal bureaucracy’s internal capabilities that support the planning, management, and implementation of waste management policy to achieve its expected outcomes effectively and efficiently. Based on the approach of 19 The National Statistics Institute, through the 2014 National Registry of Municipalities, reported municipal-level data on waste quantity for that year in one of six categories, some of which had wide quantity ranges, such as “from 50 to less than 100 tons per day” (category five). To obtain a more accurate waste collection quantity value for this year, I followed three estimation steps. First, I calculated the growth or decline rate from 2016 to 2018 and used it to obtain a 2014 collection quantity. Second, I adjusted those cases with an estimate from the first step that was below or above their selected category range in 2014 to the mid-point of that category. I applied this only to those cases belonging to categories one through three (below one ton/day, one to less than three tons/day, or three to less than nine tons/day, respectively). However, I applied a third step to those cases with an estimated value outside their 2014 quantity range and that fell under category four, five, or six that year (nine to less than 50 tons/day, 50 to less than 100 tons/day, or 100 or more tons/day, respectively). This involved performing a random data check to confirm that the resulting estimates approximated their 2016 and 2018 values and were within their selected 2014 waste collection quantity category. 85 classical organizational theory scholars (Lawrence and Lorsch 1967; Thompson 1967) and recent research suggesting the use of more specific measures of capacity (Krause et al. 2016; Krause et al. 2019), this concept is operationalized by examining two components. First, the degree to which the municipal office responsible for waste management is internally specialized, which means having differentiated management features or components for this service (i.e., organizational structure, internal and external coordination processes, policy documents). Exploratory factor analysis is used to capture waste management administrative capacity through different dimensions. A waste management administrative capacity index is thus used in the analysis based on variables measuring the existence of waste management and environmental management policy instruments, structure, and decision-making space (see Table A3.2 in the Appendix). Second, two additional key variables are included in the model to capture administrative capacity specifically related to each waste service. The concept of service equipment measures whether the municipality has differentiated operational resources or components (i.e., trained personnel, operational office resources, budget allocation, operational waste trucks) for each of the two waste services. Given the data available, this concept is operationalized through the number of waste collection vehicles, in the models using waste collection as the dependent variable, and the number of waste disposal equipment, for the models assessing waste disposal. The waste collection vehicles variable adds the total vehicles the municipality has, such as the number of collection trucks (i.e. dump and compactor trucks), tricycles, and cargo motor tricycle, all of which are used to provide this service. The result is standardized by municipal surface area. The waste disposal equipment variable computes the total number of gatehouses, weight scales, 86 waste loaders (i.e. backhoe and track loaders), and wheelbarrows employed for this service. Disposal equipment is standardized by population size. CSO presence is conceptually defined as the degree to which locally rooted and formal CSOs exist in the municipality’s jurisdiction (Cammett and MacLean 2014; Putnam et al. 1993). It is operationalized by analyzing neighborhood associations, which have evident roots in the community, are formal, and tend to be actively involved in local issues (Jaramillo and Alcázar 2013; Jaramillo and Wright 2015; Remy 2004). In Peru, neighborhood associations are umbrella organizations officially created by municipal ordinance, upon request of its members or neighbors, and composed of representatives from diverse community groups. Their primary purpose is to discuss and propose local policy and investment priorities, oversee the implementation of local development plans, and improve service delivery (DFID 2003; Law Decree No. 27972 2003, Title VII, Chapter IV; Remy 2004). While they have recognized weaknesses, neighborhood associations are the principal means for evaluating solutions of local community issues and are independent of cogovernance venues like Local Coordination Councils (Jaramillo 2009, 122; McNulty 2019, 139; Remy 2004). Studying neighborhood associations’ presence allows us to better understand whether and how these actors influence performance differences between waste collection and disposal services. Exploratory factor analysis is performed to create two neighborhood association indices using different organizational and participation features of neighborhood associations –– with one including its membership size relative to the municipality’s population–– to capture the 87 local variation of formal, locally embedded CSO presence more fully (see Table A3.3 in the Appendix).20 An alternative measure, CSO concentration, is included to examine another type of formal and locally embedded CSO assessing the concentration, in number of organizations per 1,000 people, of community-based poverty alleviation CSOs in the municipality. These groups include community kitchens, nutrition organizations (i.e., “glass of milk”), mothers’ clubs, youth organizations, and others. All exclusively provide social services and support to low-income families, especially single mothers and their children (DFID 2003; McNulty 2013). Poverty-alleviation CSOs are also crucial because they also serve as collective action groups for a range of other community-related problems, ad-hoc or otherwise (Arroyo and Irigoyen 2005, 77; de la Riva Agüero 2021). Examining these CSOs’ concentration, standardized by population size, helps capture the influence of other formal and locally rooted CSOs’ presence. Cogovernance evaluates the extent to which CSOs and local government authorities jointly participate in the planning and budgeting of local policies. It refers to the formal interaction between a local government and CSOs within its jurisdiction for jointly making plans and budget allocation decisions to address issues of local importance, which usually includes discussions about the provision of public services such as waste management (Cheng 2019a; Nabatchi et al. 2017; Voorberg et al. 2015). Cogovernance is operationalized through an index capturing the extent to which Local Coordination Councils (LCC) engage in local planning and budgeting. Exploratory factor analysis is used to create the cogovernance index (see Table A3.4 in the 20 Two indices are used, first, to examine the sensitivity of the model from adding a key variable to the index and, second, because the index with the variable of membership size relative to population only has 756 observations in 2018, causing an important reduction in the sample size when running the regressions. Both indices help assess variations in neighborhood associations’ characteristics across municipalities. 88 Appendix). It includes variables on LCC’s actions for planning and budgeting and measures on civil society and total representatives relative to the municipality’s population. In Peru, LCCs are the main municipal cogovernance venues. The mayor leads LCCs and are composed of municipal council members and CSO representatives that can have 40% of the seats (Law Decree No. 27972 2003, Title VII, Chapter III). Their mandate is to coordinate the joint planning and approval of local development policies and budgets (Jaramillo and Alcázar 2013; McNulty 2019; Remy 2004), making them essential to assess cogovernance in this context. 3.2.3 Control Variables The first set of controls looks at overall municipal administrative capacity. Exploratory factor analysis is used to create an index for general administrative capacity (see Table A3.5 in the Appendix).21 To control for political capital and experience as proxies of local politics’ influence on service performance (Avellaneda 2012), the model includes the mayor’s electoral vote share in the 2010-201122 and 2014-20152324 elections.25 This measure captures electoral support for the 21 It includes measures of the proportion of its total employees out of the total population, number of computers with internet access per municipal worker, whether the municipality has a cadastre of its jurisdiction and a cadastral information system, total municipal budget per capita, and different binary variables assessing its capacity to manage its results-based budgeting (RBB) program (Christensen and Gazley 2008; Ingraham et al. 2003). 22 Elections were declared null in 34 municipalities in 2010. They were carried out again in different times during 2011. Available through: https://portal.jne.gob.pe/portal_documentos/files/procesoselectorales/Documentos%20%20Procesos%20electorales/ Elecciones%20Municipales%20Complementarias%202011/RADIO-URBANO.pdf. 23 Elections were declared null in 31 municipalities (two provincial, 29 districts) in 2014. They were carried out again in different times during 2015.

Available through: https://gestion.pe/peru/politica/jne-34-501-electores-votaran-elecciones-municipales-2015-99435-noticia/. 25 The 2011 and the 2015 elections are considered extemporaneous elections. However, the elected administrations’ tenure periods still ended in 2014 and 2018, respectively. 89 2011-2014 and 2015-2018 tenure periods, respectively. The model also controls for the influence of mayoral reelection, whether the mayor belongs to a local or regional party (as opposed to a national party or alliance), and if the mayor is female (Jaramillo and Alcázar 2017). Peruvian municipalities have significantly diverse ecological and geographic areas, primarily associated with different altitudes, weathers, and natural environments. The most prosperous cities in the country are on the Pacific coast (Escobal and Torero 2005). A binary variable is included to control for such differences, comparing coastal municipalities with other regions as base category. Socioeconomic factors are accounted for using municipal poverty and total population. Descriptive statistics are included in Table 3.1, in Chapter 2 variable description (Table A2.2), and in the Appendix key variables’ temporal variation (Graphs A3.1-A3.3), and the correlation matrix (Table A3.1). 90 Table 3.1.

Not much within variation is expected at the municipal level over time across the three years used in the panel and the standard errors are higher when fixing effects at that level. Moreover, given that Peru is a very heterogeneous country at the provincial level26 –– socioeconomically, geographically, environmentally, administratively, politically, and in other factors–– it is crucial to control for unobservables between provinces that may bias the coefficients of both the independent and dependent variables. It is also more likely to observe variation over time within provinces in the three-year panel used. Thus, I account for unobserved location-specific time-invariant correlations with regressors using fixed-effects at the provincial level. Using fixed effects via provincial dummy variables instead of municipal dummy variables is hence more appropriate. Following that logic, standard errors are also clustered on provinces to use fewer clusters and adjust for correlations between observations across different years and municipalities in each provincial group (Cameron and Miller 2015). 3.2.5 Data Limitations A limitation of the datasets used, particularly the National Registry of Municipalities of Peru, is that they do not report on CSOs involved in either waste service or CSO capacity relevant for these services. Similarly, this study does not account for local cogovernance focused on waste service planning and budgeting. Future research would shed light, for instance, on how CSOs’ specific involvement on waste or the decision-making processes of cogovernance venues 26 Peru has two types of local governments: Provincial municipalities, which are similar to US counties, and district municipalities, equivalent to US cities. They are distributed across 25 regional governments (comparable to US states, with less political and fiscal autonomy). However, the term municipalities in this study refers to district municipalities. 92 regarding waste issues matter for waste service performance differences. More nuanced analyses by regional or municipal subgroups could also provide important insights. Municipal-level qualitative and survey research methods are ideally suited for these tasks. 3.3 Findings The findings from the main regression models are presented in Table 3.2. It contains four models of waste collection performance, two assessing collection frequency (models 1 and 2) and two collection quantity (models 3 and 4), and two models of waste disposal performance, evaluating proper disposal (models 5 and 6). Two models are run for each dependent variable, with the main difference being that each includes one of the two neighborhood association indices. The primary independent variable of interest is the waste management administrative capacity index, including the measures of waste management capacity specific to each service. Two secondary independent variables of interest are the neighborhood association indices, and the cogovernance index. The waste management capacity index is statistically significant in all the collection frequency and proper disposal models, with positive coefficients, but not significant in the collection quantity models. This suggests that, all else equal, strengthening administrative capacity, at the municipal waste office level, is associated with increased waste collection frequency and proper waste disposal in landfills or through recycling, composting, or treatment methods. A one standard deviation increase in waste management administrative capacity is associated with a half-day increase in collection frequency per week, at the 0.1% level in both models, and an additional 2 percentage points of waste properly disposed annually, at the 5% and 10% levels in models 5 and 6, respectively. Waste management capacity thus improves the performance of both simple and complex waste services. 93 Similarly, the specific waste management capacity measures are positive and significant on all six models, confirming that these capacity equipments also raise waste service performance. Adding one more waste collection vehicle per square mile is associated with an increase in collection frequency of 0.11 days per week, or about 2.6 more hours according to model 1, and of 0.13 days per week or 3.1 more hours according to model 2. Both are significant at the 0.1% and 1% levels, respectively. An extra collection vehicle per square mile also increases the amount of daily waste collected in about 0.04 metric tons per day per 1,000 people, which translates into roughly 40 kilograms or 88.2 pounds according to models 3 and 4 and significant at the 0.1% level. Likewise, an extra disposal equipment per 1,000 people improves proper disposal performance by 2.6 percentage points each year per model 5, at the 10% level, and by 2.9 percentage points annually per model 6, at the 5% level. While results with p-value < 0.10, such as in model 6 for the waste management capacity index and model 5 for waste disposal equipment, do not meet the standard threshold for statistical significance of p-value < 0.05, they still have important implications for public administration research and practice (Gelman and Stern 2006; Gill 1999). The presence of formal and locally embedded CSOs, such as neighborhood associations, is only positively and significantly associated with improved collection frequency performance using both indices. Examining the index without the total membership variable, a one standard deviation increase in the neighborhood association index is associated with an increase of 0.15 days per week in collection frequency, or approximately 3.6 hours per week. Similarly, using the index with the total membership variable, model 2 shows that a one standard deviation increase in the neighborhood association index increases collection frequency in 0.16 days per week, or about 3.8 hours. Both models are significant at the 1% level. The presence of neighborhood 94 associations does not show a statistically significant association with collection quantity and proper disposal performance, even though the coefficients are positive. However, the other measure of CSO presence, examining the role of the concentration of poverty alleviation local organizations per 1,000 people, is negatively and significantly associated with collection frequency, at the 5% level in both models. It reduces frequency by about 1 hour as their territorial density increases. This type of CSO shows no association with collection quantity and proper disposal, although the coefficients are positive, except in model 6. Cogovernance, on the other hand, is only significantly associated with the two waste collection dependent variables, frequency and quantity, although it has negative coefficients on collection frequency and positive coefficients on collection quantity. This indicates that cogovernance venues such as LCCs are important to make planning and budgeting decisions, improving the amount of waste collected in about 0.13 or 0.14 metric tons per day per 1,000 people, which is equivalent to 287 or 309 pounds, per models 3 and 4, respectively. Simultaneously, cogovernance through LCCs helps reduce the number of times collection teams make their rounds in roughly 13 hours per week. Results from the control variables show a significant and positive association between the general administrative capacity of the municipality and collection frequency, but none with collection quantity and proper disposal performance. A one standard deviation increase in the general administrative capacity index is associated with roughly 3.8 or 4 hours added to the collection frequency routine each week. However, an inverse and significant association is observed between mayors’ vote share and collection frequency, at the 0.1% level in model 1 and 1% level in model 2. Poverty is statistically significant and only negatively associated with collection quantity. The ecological region variable is only significant and positively associated 95 with collection frequency when comparing coastal municipalities with those in other regions as base category. 96 Table 3.2.

The presence of such CSOs does not influence proper waste disposal performance. These findings also partially support hypothesis 3 that cogovernance for planning and budgeting is positively associated with performance improvements in both waste collection and disposal services, regardless of their relative complexity differences. Cogovernance increases collection quantity, reduces collection frequency, and has no effect on disposal. This suggests that the service-specific administrative capacity of municipal waste offices, captured through an index and waste capacity equipments, has crucial implications for understanding the performance of both relatively simple and complex waste management services. Unlike general municipal administrative capacity improvements that enhance only simple waste service provision, waste management administrative capacity illustrates that improved waste office specialization and equipment benefits both collection frequency and proper disposal services. Having relevant waste and environmental planning and policy instruments, as well as specific equipment, are critical for simple and complex service performance. This contrasts with non-direct, general municipal capacity factors such as more personnel, technological hardware and software, or a results-based budgeting program. As occurs across the Global South, many municipalities in Peru struggle to provide relatively complex disposal services while keeping their streets clean. While this study’s results show that service-specific capacity is critical, other evidence finds that, on the ground, the 99 primary waste-related duties of municipal waste offices are to oversee the monthly hiring of trash collection teams, the occasional acquisition of gears (e.g., mouth masks, uniforms, boots, gloves), and solving other administrative issues. These shortcomings and collection-centered waste operations are further aggravated by the fact that some municipalities simultaneously share their waste duties with the provision of other public services and lack trained personnel (de la Riva Agüero 2021). In this context, waste administrators make decisions regarding the delivery of services of different complexity levels. Examining waste offices’ internal conditions and addressing limitations of service-specific waste management administrative capacity may have consequential results to correct these performance gaps. While it is generally expected that the presence and thus active involvement of well-organized civil society actors, particularly those embedded in the communities in which they operate, is likely to produce better performance outcomes for all public services, the initial results reject those assumptions. The findings indicate that formal and locally embedded CSOs, such as neighborhood associations, may support simple service performance, such as waste collection frequency, but their participation’s influence disappears for more complex services. This could mean that these CSOs may be able to effectively supplement the state when services are relatively simple. Given the low waste management administrative capacity of municipal offices, on average, it is likely that some type of supplementation occurs for simple collection frequency. The findings are consistent across models using either neighborhood association index. This suggests that while strong, service-specific administrative capacity might be necessary to deliver this relatively more complex service, the presence of CSOs may not suffice to help improve its performance. Two additional mechanisms could explain this result, unrelated to 100 CSO’s capabilities. One, limited service-specific administrative capacity in waste units may preclude their managers from planning the involvement of CSOs in complex proper disposal (de la Riva Agüero 2021). Two, gender and socioeconomic discrimination may bias waste managers’ perception against CSOs led by women and low-income people (Fredericks 2009). Further research on the mechanisms of CSO involvement in collection and disposal services would elucidate these findings. Another interesting result is that these local CSOs increase collection frequency but not collection quantity. This might mean that when CSOs such as neighborhood associations are present, they tend to prioritize setting up waste collection activities and teams focused on going out more often to pick up trash. However, increased attention to frequency does not necessarily equate to a greater collection quantity. These CSOs ––but mainly municipalities, who acquire most waste vehicles–– face equipment limitations that affect the quantity of waste they can carry each time. The model results show a positive and significant association with collection quantity; more vehicles increase the amount of waste collected. Another possibility is that local governments are allowing neighborhood associations to go out as collection teams, supplementing or substituting municipal collection personnel, to appease public pressure for trash pickup through visible waste picking teams but that are not necessarily doing much about improving collection quantity. The limited human resource capabilities that municipal waste offices generally have, compounded with equipment limitations, may preclude them from rigorously supervising how well neighborhood associations’ collection teams carry out their routines, how much of the waste is collected, or the proportion of a municipality’s jurisdiction that is covered by them. Additional research is needed to assess these possibilities. 101 The concentration of poverty alleviation CSOs is positively correlated with municipal poverty levels, indicating that it is likely that poorer local governments have more such organizations, which in turn have more members. Some poor municipalities also tend to employ their most vulnerable residents, formally or not, to deliver waste management services, usually related to collection (de la Riva Agüero 2021). An increase in the concentration of these CSOs, and in turn of their members, is negatively associated with collection frequency, with very small coefficients, suggesting that their participation in waste collection, as a group, may require them to go out less often although not necessarily changing the amount collected. As a labor-intensive activity, waste collection frequency performed by the municipality may fall because these CSOs are taking over some of these responsibilities. The local government benefits from more people willing and available to do the job, likely costing less, and who may be more committed for several reasons, such as their community or organizational cohesiveness, concern for their community’s environment and health, or expectations of commensurate municipal support to their urgent livelihood needs through their CSOs or direct in-kind or in-cash rewards. Regarding cogovernance, the reduction it produces in collection frequency while at the same time increasing collection quantity in important amounts may result from LCC’s planning and budgeting decisions that likely prioritize a more efficient waste collection strategy involving, among other measures, the purchase of necessary waste equipment. One possible reason why cogovernance is not associated with waste disposal performance is that its associated issues are likely not a matter of pressing discussion in LCCs. At the very least, the disposal-related topics brought to the table are not relevant to produce a significant influence on this service’s performance, possibly due to its relative complexity and low immediate salience. More urgent topics such as municipal infrastructure construction, poverty-alleviating measures, local 102 economic development and support for local businesses, waste collection issues and vehicle purchase, and budget allocation to other critical services may have more significance. Research on Peruvian local collaborative decision-making argues that cogovernance venues such as LCCs do not function effectively in general due to two possible reasons: first, the high participation costs faced by poor people and the organizational limitations of the CSOs representing them and, second, municipalities’ lack of capacity to manage these cogovernance arenas or implement agreements (Jaramillo and Alcázar 2017; McNulty 2011, 2019). However, this article finds that, on average, they are at least helping improve waste collection performance and efficiency in two concurrent ways: minimizing routine frequency and simultaneously rising the amount removed from the streets. 3.5 Conclusions One of the most pressing questions of our time is how governments can better respond to complex or unexpected events. This is particularly true for municipalities in the Global South, which face constant climate change threats with weak local capabilities and severe hazards that increase vulnerability. These impacts surpass the local capacity to address them effectively via service provision, despite the involvement of organized civil society actors that tend to enhance performance and increased collaborations. Additionally, service performance varies depending on the relative complexity level of the service. Unfortunately, little public administration or political science scholarship has examined how local governance factors, such as service-specific administrative capacity, the presence of locally embedded CSOs, and local collaborative governance for planning and budgeting (or cogovernance), affect performance when services become relatively more complex. Complex service provision is especially demanding for 103 struggling municipalities that attempt to creatively act with limited administrative capacity to specifically deliver them. This difficulty may extend to CSOs engaged in public service issues in their communities, challenging the notion that service performance improves when they are formal and locally rooted, regardless of a service’s relative complexity. Similarly, cogovernance venues may not equally support more complex service performance. This study’s nuanced assessment of these relationships, particularly capacity, service complexity, and performance, is important. This research uses waste service provision as a case to examine how variation in local governance factors may have differential effects on the performance of two services of distinct complexity. Particularly, it compares the performance of a relatively simple service, waste collection from the streets, and a relatively more complex service, proper waste disposal, to understand how the three local governance factors influence their performance. The empirical analysis of Peruvian municipalities shows that while more robust waste offices, the presence of neighborhood-based CSOs, and cogovernance for planning and budgeting decisions enhance simple service performance, only waste office strengthening boosts complex service performance. The findings have implications for studying the complexity of other services sharing a sector, with differences in the three task dimensions used to compare waste collection and disposal. For instance, in the health sector, while malaria prevention and tuberculosis services imply low operational complexity and low human asset-specificity, HIV/AIDS services require higher levels on both dimensions (Schäferhoff 2014). The classification approach to service complexity suggested here may be valuable to assess the relative complexity of services in the same domain. 104 This study is also useful for practitioners managing relatively complex services that juggle policy trade-offs in difficult contexts with scarce resources. The policy implications of these findings suggest that strengthening service-specific administrative capacity in local governments is fundamental to provide increasingly complex services in the Global South. This means that investments that reinforce office capacity specific to a relatively complex municipal service is especially crucial to improve performance. Similarly, policymakers, local and national, may benefit from supporting formal and locally embedded CSOs and cogovernance venues, which seem to have a significant influence on simple service provision. Paying attention to these three local governance factors, particularly service-specific capacity, may lead to better delivery of relatively complex services. 3.6 Data Availability The data underlying this article are available in the Dryad Digital Repository, at https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.m0cfxpp44. 105 References Abarca-Guerrero, Lilliana, Ger Maas, and William Hogland. 2013. \"Solid Waste Management Challenges for Cities in Developing Countries.\" Waste Management 33(1): 220-232.

In Satipo, the Waste Management Suboffice does a respectable job in delivering both simple waste collection and complex waste disposal. Two different teams are in charge of each service, which are in turn subdivided into different subunits, showing that waste service management is specialized despite their complexity differences. Collection has two subunits, one cleaning the streets at night and the other collecting sorted waste bags in the morning. Disposal also has two main subunits, one working on reusing waste through composting and recycling and the other dedicated to landfill management. For this to work, they have based the provision of these services on standardized procedures that experienced environmental engineers oversee. All this effort requires community involvement, which is why there is a Governance Suboffice that manages the participation of community CSOs in permanent coordination with the Waste Suboffice’s tasks. On the contrary, the Bagua Grande Waste Management Suboffice deals with both services through the same personnel and resources, almost entirely dedicated to waste collection. With hardly any protocol or equipment assigned for waste disposal management, this complex service is in a state of abandonment. Highly specialized administrative capacity thus is a fundamental driver for the adequate performance of these two waste services with distinct complexity. However, public sector administrative capacity is usually studied by examining general structures, budgets and spending, personnel quantity and quality, top management features, and information technology (Andrews 2010; Christensen and Gazley 2008; Fernandez 2004; Fernandez and Moldogaziev 2013; Grindle 2007; Ingraham et al. 2003; O'Toole Jr. and Meier 120 2003; Olvera and Avellaneda 2019; Rainey and Steinbauer 1999). They are essential measures to study government capacity and its role in performance –– these aggregate resources of public agencies matter for the provision of services. Thus, this work provides the theoretical background regarding key administrative factors that guides my dissertation’s deductive reasoning from a general perspective. Three underlying assumptions tend to guide the study of administrative capacity in public organizations. One is that the more resources an organization has, the more likely it will internally distribute them proportionately across all units and services. Similarly, a second assumption is that the larger the organizational budget, the more likely all its units will have equal capacity levels. Based on these two assumptions, a third is that the wealthier the organization, the more capacity its units have, and thus the higher its service provision performance regardless of the type of service or its complexity. While this is possibly true in some localities, this dissertation demonstrates that such assumptions are flawed because the aggregate capacity and resources that a bureaucracy has are likely unevenly distributed throughout its different offices to favor the services that are more socially urgent and politically salient (Avellaneda 2012; Johnson 2009; Leonard 2010; McDonnell 2020). Moreover, in the case of local governments, as discussed in Chapter 3, general administrative capacity measures –– such as overall human resources, budget, and information systems, for instance–– capture organizational features that are distant and likely unrelated to the performance of a particular service. The issue is that these measures aggregate data from all its units. This approach indicates that it is more accurate to assess performance by examining the capacity that is directly involved in the provision of a service. Understanding the performance of a particular service through assessing administrative capabilities that are not related to its 121 delivery or are distant to the office (or offices) managing it may likely lead to biased results and flawed analyses. While the general administrative capacity is crucial, since offices not involved in provision participate one way or another, service performance and its intricacies are more precisely comprehended by looking at the administrative capacity proximately used in its management and provision. In other words, studying the administrative capacity of the office responsible for service provision will more likely reveal the insights we need to understand public service performance better. This approach is not new. Research on organizational theory conducted by early public administration scholars was concerned with the internal administrative conditions of public organizations, starting with the work of Simon (1948). What insights did early organizational theorists leave us to consider? Simon spearheaded interest in uncovering what occurred inside public organizations to explain outcomes by focusing on the decision-making processes to get to the “real flesh and bones of an organization” (1948, xi). Other scholars have followed the path of analyzing organizations' features and interactions (Galbraith 1974, 2002; Lawrence and Lorsch 1967; Mintzberg 1983; Thompson 1967). Classical organizational theorists such as Lawrence and Lorsch (1967) argued that the differentiation among subunits within an organization, and the extent of their internal integration and coordination, improve their capacity to manage pressures from their external environment and hence performance. The following statement illustrates this perspective on the value of examining the internal conditions of organizations: 122 Since the primary concern was with the internal functioning of organizations, it appeared that one useful way to conceive of the environment of an organization was to look at it from the organization outward. This approach is based on the assumption that an organization is an active system which tends to reach out and order its otherwise overly complex surroundings so as to cope with them effectively. Then as the organization becomes differentiated into basic subsystems, it segments its environment into related sectors … The importance of this variability can easily be obscured by the usual approach of thinking of an organization’s environment as a single entity (Lawrence and Lorsch 1967, 4-5). This means that to perform well, it is crucial that an organization’s internal functioning – –such as specializing or differentiating subunits and adopting internal coordination procedures–– matches or fits the complexity of the task, and thus its environment. It is argued that “[a] poor fit between structure and environment leads to failure; a close fit leads to success” (Jones 2010, 111). Therefore, these scholars regarded organizational performance as dependent on their capacity to internally adapt to process the complexity of a task and its external environment (Fernandez and Rainey 2006, 3; Jones 2010; Scott and Davis 2007, 95). Organizational differentiation and integration are thus two dimensions of organizational structure, meaning the division of labor into more specialized tasks coordinated through diverse mechanisms. For Mintzberg (1983), differentiation and integration are essential to achieve organizational goals effectively. Increasingly complex organizational tasks would benefit from implementing coordination mechanisms based on standardizing work processes, output, or skills required (Mintzberg 1983). Galbraith (1974, 2002) studied flexible internal coordination arrangements, or lateral coordination processes, that facilitate rapid internal response to organizational structures that are difficult to reform or operate in increasingly uncertain external environments. Thompson (1967), however, was concerned with organizational processes or mechanisms and argued that the tasks and units of the technical core are operationally linked 123 through something he called organizational rationality, referring to the input, process, and output activities internally set up for organizational performance. These studies represent some of the most prominent classical views about public organizations. They show that the internal capacity of organizations ––in terms of specialized structure and coordination–– affects performance. Budgets are crucial but cannot be used efficiently without the specialized capacity to manage a particular service. Internal capacity adjustments should hence correspond to service complexity according to this perspective. This means that opening the administrative black box of bureaucracies was a central matter for classical organizational theory researchers. Their approach is still relevant today for the study of organizations, mainly to understand the role of service-specific administrative capacity on the provision of services varying in complexity more accurately. Applying this classical organizational theory approach, this dissertation studies waste management services in Global South cities by focusing on their administrative capacity specialization to understand service performance when their tasks vary in complexity. Thus, by looking at different hierarchical levels involved in waste service provision, I unpack features of municipal organizational structure ––including unit specialization for service provision, coordination, and the processes and resources within them–– to examine their specialization. I also study other important drivers from the literature on political support and organizational behavior to understand top management decision-making and commitment as well as worker motivation, satisfaction, and empowerment concerning their role in waste service performance (Colquitt et al. 2007; Crabtree and Durand 2017; Fernandez and Moldogaziev 2013; Goggin et al. 1990; Grindle and Hilderbrand 1995; Hameduddin and Fernandez 2019; Heller 1996; Herrera 124 2017; Isen and Reeve 2005; Jones 2003; Kahneman 2002; Kumar et al. 2022; Lyubomirsky et al. 2005; March and Olsen 1984; March and Simon 1993; Vroom 2000). All these factors vary with the complexity of the service, affecting its ultimate performance. The degree of waste service complexity, such as when comparing collection with disposal, may thus require equivalent specialization of the internal management and resources of the local government. Yet, specialization, mainly for more complex services such as waste disposal, is challenging in localities with limited administrative capacity. What tends to happen on the ground is that waste management offices in local governments put all their administrative efforts ––including procedures, personnel, and equipment–– into collection services at the expense of the higher technical and managerial needs of disposal services. However, the quantitative results from Chapter 3 correspond with the theories of classical organizational theory scholars. They show that more specialized internal capacity and equipment, in the case of waste services, improve the performance of both simple collection and complex disposal in Global South municipalities. Thus, it is likely that unspecialized administrative capacity for complex service provision lowers performance relative to those services for which they are sufficiently specialized and equipped with relevant resources, typically the more simple ones as collection. What remains unclear are the conditions that lead to better performance, particularly when services increase in complexity. To uncover the causal mechanisms, this chapter answers the following question: Under what conditions does service-specific municipal administrative capacity affect the performance of both simple and complex services? I argue that the specialization of capacity for the provision of each service, collection and disposal, is key at three levels: top leadership, management office staff, and field workers. Therefore, it is necessary that simple collection and complex disposal 125 have the following for better performance: top municipal leadership, managerial and political, that is committed and understand their distinct implementation implications; differentiated organizational structure, team qualifications, policies and procedures, and equipment that correspond to each service’s requirements at the management office level, and; field workers that are respected and recognized regardless of whether they pick up waste in the streets or cover dump holes. The section that follows discusses the findings to illustrate the principal causal mechanisms. The final section concludes. 4.1 Administrative Capacity and Waste Services Performance Differences: Conditions and Causal Mechanisms To better understand the performance differences observed between waste collection and waste disposal locally, I examine the internal conditions of the waste suboffices in three local governments to explain why this occurs. As discussed in Chapter 2, I study three medium-sized municipal cases with differences in two key characteristics, administrative capacity and CSO involvement, to assess how variations in these two crucial drivers influence waste service performance disparities. The municipality of Bagua Grande represented the low waste administrative capacity –– low CSO involvement case, the municipality of Sicuani the low waste administrative capacity –– high CSO involvement case, and the municipality of Satipo the high waste administrative capacity –– high CSO involvement case. I identify conditions and causal mechanisms at three different hierarchical levels within municipalities: top leadership, management office, and field workers. The patterns show possible administrative capacity conditions and processes occurring at each level that appear to be associated with diverging waste service outcomes. First, the degree to which top leadership –– 126 which includes local politicians and high-level managers–– understands the implementation intricacies of a service and is committed to it determines how much support they provide for problem-solving. The result is that relatively complex services like waste disposal receive less attention and support. Second, waste management suboffice specialization is also crucial. Those that have a poorly specialized organizational structure, with supervisors mainly qualified to set up basic collection routines, implementation procedures only for collection, and are equipped mainly with brooms, dustpans, and tricycles are more likely to provide collections services adequately but struggle significantly for disposal. Finally, most field workers are underappreciated and many times belittled by municipal authorities and citizens. They continue to work with dedication due to their need of an income to sustain their families. However, given the complexity of disposal services, their job at the dump is more challenging. Because these sites are outside the city, they are not seen and hence their struggles are neglected. Management provides them with less support, perceiving their issues and risks as similar to collection workers in the streets, which complicates their ability to do a better job for waste disposal. This overview shows that the presence or absence of these conditions and mechanisms likely have important implications over the performance of waste collection and waste disposal, thus explaining the performance gaps between them. A summary of the findings is provided in Table 4.1. 127 Table 4.1. Administrative capacity characteristics Categories Bagua Grande Sicuani Satipo Specialized Administrative Capacity Top Leadership Poor Moderate High Management Office Poor Poor High Field Workers Poor Moderate High Waste Service Performance Collection High High High Disposal Poor Poor High Sources: Fieldwork. Notes: Category classifications are: none, poor, moderate, and high. To sum up, I found that both the municipalities of Bagua Grande and Sicuani have adequate performance in the provision of waste collection services while blatantly failing in the provision of waste disposal services. Although their waste suboffices face some limitations to cover certain sections of their cities, overall, they can keep their streets clean. On the contrary, the municipality of Satipo was successful both in the provision of waste collection and waste disposal services. This local government kept most of its streets fully clean without accumulated or uncollected waste and, simultaneously, adequately disposed of its waste using managerially, operationally, and technically more elaborate methods. Why do all succeed in providing simple waste collection? Why do Bagua Grande and Sicuani fail to provide complex waste disposal properly? What is different in Satipo? The lines that follow provide details on the administrative capacity conditions and causal mechanisms leading to these differential outcomes. The findings uncover the extent to which top leadership understands and is committed to both services, waste suboffices are specialized and equipped to equally provide both waste collection and waste disposal services, and the morale and bias in the treatment experienced by field workers in collection and disposal. Looking at administrative 128 capacity in this way partly reveals why complex waste disposal tends to underperform relative to simple waste collection and the conditions in which both can be adequately provided. 4.1.1 Top Leadership: Local Politicians and High-Level Managers Services are attended based on decision-makers’ prime concerns. In turn, their priorities are likely shaped by a combination of what or how much they know about a service’s management, its implications for society, and their own political interests from issue salience (Avellaneda 2012; Bélanger and Meguid 2008; Goggin et al. 1990; Kumar et al. 2022; World Bank 2003). Bounded rationality and information accessibility leads decision-makers to rank order services in certain way (March and Simon 1993; Simon 1948). This means that, using heuristics, the complex services ––which are more difficult to comprehend–– are likely regarded as having similar implications as simple ones because these are more accessible for understanding (Kahneman 2002). Through these information processing mechanisms local leaders may struggle to have an accurate grasp of complex services such as waste disposal, causing them to have insufficient commitment to their performance and not provide necessary support (Fernandez 2004). Differentiated capacity in leadership tends to be low for complex services. The findings show that top decision-makers in the municipalities struggling with waste disposal performance, Bagua Grande and Sicuani, have an inadequate understanding of this complex service while a solid one for waste collection. In Satipo, where performance is high for both waste services, leaders have detailed knowledge of both services. Table 4.2 summarizes these characteristics by municipal case study. 129 Table 4.2. Top leadership involvement Categories Bagua Grande Sicuani Satipo Collection Service Understanding High High High Commitment High High High Disposal Service Understanding Poor Poor High Commitment Poor Poor High Sources: Fieldwork. Notes: Category classifications are: none, poor, moderate, and high. Politicians and top managers in Bagua Grande and Sicuani have limited awareness of the managerial and implementation requirements of disposal. Likewise, their commitment to strengthening its provision or developing solutions that are at least temporary is low. Even though they tend to be aware of problems that disposal services confront, this is superficial. Inaction is typically the response. This situation is not due to budgetary allocation problems, that are also in part a product leadership priorities. The findings show that the differential interest is likely due to issues of decision-making capacity ––from complex information processing–– and the higher political and social salience of waste collection. The subsections that follow discuss the results in detail. a. Overall misconception of waste disposal service implications. Waste managers and top political and administrative authorities in the two underperforming cases, Bagua Grande and Sicuani, are aware of the broad infrastructural, cost, and material needs for disposal (trucks, excavators, backhoe loaders). However, unlike managers in Satipo, authorities in the other two cases are not sufficiently aware of its managerial, technical knowledge, and health implications. 130 Bagua Grande and Sicuani. The discussions on disposal problems in these two cities are focused on the lack of financial resources for the infrastructural investment project needed to implement a fully-equipped disposal facility (Int-BG-30, Int-SI-74). “The challenge of the dump is to make the disposal project viable, which is 20 million Peruvian Soles [USD 5.15 million] … it is impossible to do it with municipal resources,” said a top waste manager (Int-BG-30).28 Although important budgets for spending on waste disposal are available, they are not efficiently spent or go unused (Int-BG-20, Int-SI-24). Even if financing these investments were the problem, innovative or accessible techniques for disposal are not on the decision-making table or scaled up. The blame is somewhere else, sometimes the budget or the equipments, and others on citizens: “[I]f the residents of the urban area would help, 70-80% [of waste] would be reused and only 20% would reach the dump,” said another manager complaining about the amount of waste sent to the disposal site (Int-SI-4). Therefore, the understanding of the service is superficial and hence limited to costs and big machinery, working under the assumption that the only solution to address the dire situation of waste disposal in both cities is through full-fledged infrastructural projects. “[I support] final disposal with logistics, budget, and personnel,” added a local politician (Int-SI-25). Another one indicated that their political commitment is observed by “sending my truck to make holes and cover them when they are full, there is no alternative” (Int-BG-31). Since waste collection is fundamentally based on routines and trucks, these politicians and managers equate this simple service to the more intricate needs for the provision of complex waste disposal. Their views of the problems and solutions are thus generally simple, lineal. Intermediate solutions are not 28 The exchange rate used in this chapter is the nominal annual average for 2021, which is when the interview took place, at 3.88 Peruvian Soles per US dollar as reported by the Peruvian Central Bank. The data was obtained from: https://estadisticas.bcrp.gob.pe/estadisticas/series/anuales/resultados/PM05242PA/html/2015/2022/. 131 sufficiently discussed, any effort toward the service is regarded as futile. This partly produces the state of abandonment of disposal services in Bagua Grande and Sicuani. Satipo. In Satipo, politicians and managers are significantly more aware of what it takes to implement disposal services, including managing a landfill. “We were afraid of using the [disposal] plant because we did not know anything … but we learned to manage it,” explained a top manager (Int-SA-23). In this city, the top leadership understands the entire recycling and composting processes, and provide a technically-oriented treatment of nonreusable waste even considering the health of their employees (Int-1-SA, Int-3-SA, Int-14-SA). Regarding the process of setting up management capacity and a disposal facility in Satipo, a politician explained: “We raised awareness [among local authorities and stakeholders from civil society] and the facility was built … [for this to work,] we did an organizational restructuring so that [the office] can execute budget and formulate policy. We saw its priority because we developed the Provincial Plan for Environmental Development” (Int-SA-35). This means that the top leadership takes disposal services seriously. There is a more nuanced, detailed, and planned understanding of the complexity of the service. Its implications are hence not compared or extrapolated from those of waste collection. Conditions and Mechanisms. The evidence shows that politicians and top managers in Satipo are informed about the managerial, technical knowledge, and health implications of waste disposal. The reason is that they regarded as a crucial service for waste management from a larger view and commitment of proper local environmental management. The series of steps and planning taken for its implementation demonstrate this. However, the misconceptions about how to 132 address service problems observed in Bagua Grande and Sicuani emerge from the low priority given to the provision of this service. This is likely complemented by issues of bounded rationality and the accessibility of using information from an associated service that is more simple, such as waste collection. This is how service understanding is a key factor contributing to waste service performance gaps. b. Low leadership commitment to problem-solving for waste disposal. Leadership commitment, and competency, are crucial for waste service performance. Political leadership and managerial entrepreneurship to gather support and resources within the municipality have an important role on the level of attention provided to each waste service. Their actions for problem-solving also matter for how service challenges are prioritized and addressed. When these actions are inclined toward greater involvement in one service, performance gaps are likely enhanced as is observed in waste service performance outcomes. In addition to the discussion on service misconceptions, the evidence shows how waste disposal is a neglected service by leadership relative to collection in the localities where it underperforms. Leadership commitment as well as competency are essential. Bagua Grande. The role of leadership is evident in Bagua Grande. A deputy waste manager recognized a set of waste service priorities and crucial problems to work on, revealing a bias. The administrator stated that “my main role … [is to] give a good solid waste collection service … [it’s my] main task,” adding that a major challenge of the Waste Suboffice is “organizing [the teams and tasks] well and to achieve the collection goals … [b]ut in the office, not much [problem]” (Int-BG-1). This statement exemplifies a pattern in this municipality of not even 133 considering waste disposal, especially at the dump, as a main waste service priority. Even if this Suboffice carries out some composting, these activities are at a very small scale and implemented with little policy and resource support and thus with great difficulty by the teams in their makeshift compositing facility. What is observed in this Suboffice, and the Environmental Office, is that to provide adequate disposal services, management leadership expect to receive budgetary resources from the central government. “The [technical] studies are expensive … we are checking with the Ministry of Environment and the Territorial Development Investment Fund [of the Ministry of Finance],” said a top administrator from the Environmental Office (Int-BG-30). They also complain that the current dump is expensive to maintain. “Complications are … [t]he dump that requires regular maintenance and costs machine-hours to the municipality,” added the same administrator even though no work is carried out there (Int-BG-30). However, a lack of resources is not the problem. Their internal managerial limitations for the provision of disposal services likely is. A top manager from the Planning and Budget Office clarified this point: The municipality … has a landfill on its way without financing. Lack of responsibility of previous civil servants, because the 2015 pre-investment [technical] study for the landfill was financed by the Territorial Development Investment Fund of the Ministry of Finance to cover the capital cities of Jamalca, Bagua Grande, and El Milagro … the study was not properly executed. They [environmental and waste managers] neglected preparing the required quarterly accountability reports, which caused the blocking of the accounts and thus the resources … This could have been corrected sending the reports but it was not done because the municipality did not want to pay the contractor. This is how the project got stuck several years … And this hinders improving [revenue] collection to improve the services (Int-BG-20). 134 This illustrates a serious mismanagement of a very intricate processes for the provision of a highly complex service. Likely, these inactions result from poor political commitment on this service, prioritizing other payments, and the lack of interest on the part of managers to address disposal problems. It also shows that the problem to manage a complex service such as waste disposal it is not fundamentally a matter of resources but of managerial commitment and competency. The case of Satipo further illustrates this statement. Sicuani. A similar problem is found in Sicuani, where leadership is not prioritizing waste disposal in their daily tasks and problem solving. A waste manager noted that when starting the job “[t]he dump was fully abandoned –– it needed maintenance, cleaning of drainage channels … we did pipes, fences, we did the toilet, planted plants, maintenance of the perimetric fences” (Int-SI-2). Despite the structural, personnel qualifications, and procedural issues for waste disposal in Sicuani (discussed in the next subsection of this chapter), leadership deflects the problem elsewhere. When asked about key waste disposal issues, a top waste administrator highlighted personnel deficiencies and pressure from the indigenous community CSO who owns the land where the dump is located: It is difficult to demand the people of the community [working at the dump] because they are very sensitive to be told something because they are from the community. There is manipulation, ‘if you don’t give me this, I will close [the dump]’ … they play with this. It is an ongoing conflict and must be handled wisely, if they want A, we must give them A (Int-SI-6). In contrast, leaders can provide full and accurate details of the state of the waste collection service. They can specify the exact routes and streets that collection women cover, and the amount of weight typically collected. 135 Top management of the Environmental Office ––which contains the Waste Suboffice–– is aware of the core operational problems for waste disposal performance (Int-SI-1). Yet, the previous quote shows that there are coordination issues between managers, with those in the Environmental Office clear on key disposal limitations but those in the Waste Suboffice seemingly confused. If the leadership inside the waste management structure is trapped by contradictory priorities and muddled coordination and communications, then addressing the performance problems of a complex waste service such as disposal is likely to fail. Attempts to gather support from the Finance Office or top political authorities would also be unsuccessful. To further illustrate these internal management issues affecting waste disposal, a manager from the Budget Suboffice stated: The [Waste Suboffice] does not adequately program its budget spending … There is no leadership from the [Environmental] Office to prioritize. Sometimes they do not even spend their budget. They do not define the main goals of the service … They do not follow up the activities in their operational plan … For instance, since the start of 2021 they have 409,000 Peruvian Soles [USD 105,412] for the maintenance of the dumpsite, for leachate, for activities and hiring of personnel, and their spending today is 0% … The great problem is that the area does not know how to do planning and budget programming (Int-SI-24). Managerial planning and proper budget spending are critical for service performance (Christensen and Gazley 2008; de la Riva Agüero 2022; Lewis 2006; World Bank 2003). Yet, the fact that the dump is in such a chaotic situation while significant financial resources are available, although unused, is highly revealing of leadership biases. Leadership priorities, managerial skill, and problem solving are prioritized mainly for waste collection, at the expense of disposal service performance. 136 Satipo. Satipo demonstrates how committed leadership can make a difference for the provision of services that vary in complexity. Managers in the Environmental Office and Waste Suboffice are proactive and committed to solving issues and getting the resources for all waste services, both collection and disposal. One clear evidence of how, despite waste disposal challenges, leadership in this municipality takes full responsibility to address its problems was expressed by a top manager of the Environmental Office: We learned to manage the disposal facility alone, without guidance or support from the Ministry of Environment … [W]e threw ourselves into the pool … The population of Portillo has protested several times threatening us because of the smell, so we felt it was important to treat this issue very carefully. I have even gone there at night to see the conditions of the facility and the next day told those responsible why things were in a certain way when they should not be. I'm demanding because I want things to be done well, I demand a lot from my teams. I tell them that ‘I want things for now, you will see how you do it, you are intelligent for a reason, you should find the solution (Int-SA-23). The budget they receive is not a limitation for these managers. “For me there is always money. It is all based on technically developing the proposal of what is needed and putting it within the legal framework that requires it to be done,” added the same manager (Int-SA-23). Another top waste administrator stated: [T]o obtain the [extra budget] from the incentive plan [of the Ministry of Finance] I have to make several plans and coordinations. If I stayed here waiting, nothing happens. I substantiate well and they give us the budget extension and this is how we cover the expenses … I go directly to the heads … [and] give detailed reports … to the municipal manager, the administration manager, the budget manager (Int-SA-1). Thus, both services’ problems are equally treated and supported, showing that high performance in collection is as important as in disposal. The motivation and technical orientation 137 of disposal managers are also very high. They are committed to planning and make projections for the service’s progress (Int-SA-5, Int-SA-6). Committed leadership and a hands-on, evidence-driven management approach to problem solving, particularly for a complex service such as waste disposal appears crucial for its performance. Conditions and Mechanisms. Leadership priorities are biased against waste disposal in Bagua Grande and Sicuani. Their Waste Suboffices have essentially given up on turning it into a better service, continuing the dumping of all sorts of waste in open and inadequately treated areas without significant changes in this service’s management. Budgetary issues are used as an excuse for their limited interest in committing to a more complex and less politically and socially salient service, such as disposal. Thus, all their efforts are directed toward the more simple but highly visible waste service, as is collection. The extent of attention, understanding, and commitment to solving disposal problems are significantly different to how its management is approached in Satipo. Leaders in this city are focused on the technical aspects specific to disposal and hence dedicated to ensuring high performance in its provision despite its complexities. Both waste services receive their full attention. How leadership works through the challenges for a waste service such as disposal has important implications over its performance. 4.1.2 Management Office Staff The waste suboffices studied show some organizational diversity upon a detailed examination of their characteristics. All three units have somewhat different internal structures, team qualifications, procedures, and tasks for the provision of waste collection and waste disposal. While all are sufficiently specialized and equipped to provide collection services, the most 138 puzzling feature across the three cases is how differently is these waste suboffices’ capacity to manage disposal services relative to collection services but also when compared to each other. The organizational structure is sufficient to provide waste collection in all three localities. All three waste management suboffices are within an Environmental Office, which oversees the work. The waste suboffices are subdivided into distinguishable tasks, such as street sweeping and waste bag pickup through trucks. This specialized structure is managed by experienced teams that have set up clear standardized procedures with sufficient equipments, all of which is necessary to provide collection services adequately. In the case of Sicuani, however, the service is entirely managed by two CSOs. Yet, only Satipo has a specialized organizational structure within its Waste Suboffice to provide the disposal service, managed by teams of experienced and trained environmental engineers that operate under well-defined protocols with proper equipment. Waste disposal provision in Bagua Grande and Sicuani is not supported by a structure, protocols, and equipments. Insufficiently trained or no workers are characteristic of Sicuani and Bagua Grande’s approach to disposal management. Table 4.3 below summarizes the specific features found in the waste suboffice of each municipality. 139 Table 4.3. Waste management office characteristics Categories Bagua Grande Sicuani Satipo Collection Organizational Structure Moderate Poor High Team Qualifications Poor Poor High Standardized Procedures Moderate Moderate High Equipment Moderate Moderate High Disposal Organizational Structure Poor Poor High Team Qualifications Poor Poor High Standardized Procedures Poor Poor High Equipment Poor Poor High Sources: Fieldwork. Notes: Category classifications are: none, poor, moderate, and high. These suboffice administrative capacity characteristics partly explain the conditions that lead to high waste collection but low waste disposal performance. Waste collection services can be adequately provided under incomplete conditions whereas disposal services cannot. These outcomes are produced through management mechanisms that are supported by the available suboffice capacity. In the case of collection, the sweeping and bag collection routines can be carried out with the administrative conditions available. More importantly, what is necessary for its provision is having a basic structure, procedures, and some basic equipment. Yet, planning, procurement, and activities related for disposal, such as composting, recycling, and dumpsite treatment, can hardly be implemented with unspecialized administrative capacity. Therefore, the capacity that is available for simple collection is not sufficient for complex disposal. a. A specialized organizational structure for collection exists, but none for disposal. All three waste management suboffices formally exist in the municipal organizational structure as units within an Environmental Office. There are structural differences at the suboffice level that 140 illustrate why the two services perform differently, however. The core structure and functions of the waste suboffices failing in the provision of waste disposal are concentrated on collecting waste bags and sweeping the streets and public spaces. The formal ––and in these cases also the informal–– organizational setup of the Bagua Grande and Sicuani suboffices thus do not adequately incorporate disposal service provision within its core responsibilities. Unlike these two suboffices, Satipo has an intricate organizational structure within its suboffice for the provision of both collection and disposal services. Figure 4.1 below shows the organizational structure for waste management in each municipality. 141 Environmental Office Waste Management Suboffice Waste Sorting National Program Street and Public Space Sweeping Waste Bag Collection Composting Environmental Office Governance & Envir.

Environmental Office Waste Management Suboffice Dumpsite Composting Public Cleaning Investment Project Waste Collection CSO (right margin) Waste Collection CSO (left margin) 142 This lack of attention in the organizational structure to waste disposal not only reflects a limited understanding of this complex service among local politicians, as discussed in section 4.1.1, who in the past have approved the current structure (Int-SI-1, Int-SA-23, Int-SA-35). Perhaps most importantly, it shows that managers and their technical teams leading these suboffices do not fully grasp the differences in the administrative and technical requirements involved in the provision of waste disposal relative to waste collection (Int-BG-1, Int-BG-13, Int-SI-4, Int-SI-6). While administrators do not manifest this explicitly, the fact that waste supervisors, managers, and their superiors in the environmental offices in Bagua Grande and Sicuani do not acknowledge the need for further structural changes reveals that the current suboffice structure is regarded as enough. The evidence shows that their waste management teams operate under the assumption that they can somehow manage to, minimally, provide waste disposal services with the exact same organizational, human, and operational resources that are used for waste collection. This is reflected in the lack of urgency to restructure the office to formally incorporate a separate waste disposal subunit specialized to strategically lead this service’s operations (Int-BG-1, Int-BG-30, Int-SI-1, Int-SI-6). Satipo, however, specialized its suboffice’s organizational structure to address its provision problems for both services (Int-SA-23). Bagua Grande. The Waste Suboffice of Bagua Grande has five main areas. However, rather than formally grouped areas within the suboffice structure they operate as tasks or activities performed by different subgroups. Two are related to waste collection, with one leading waste bag pick up and the other street sweeping. Other two areas conduct work related to waste disposal, as are the composting activities and the dumpsite. The fifth area within the suboffice is 143 gardening but its work is unrelated to waste management as it focuses on the maintenance and cleanup of public gardens (Int-BG-1, Int-BG-30). Both collection activities are not identified as part of a comprehensive waste collection strategy and are not part of a formal waste collection subunit within the Waste Suboffice. In fact, they are treated as more or less independent tasks (not necessarily subunits within a structure) that address general street cleaning services (Int-BG-2, Int-BG-5, Int-BG-27). There is a smaller task focused on collecting organic waste from a very limited number of households, but since it is a crucial activity that serves the composting area rather than the waste collection service itself it is not considered part of the latter service (Int-BG-4). For disposal, while not part of the formal structure, the suboffice has a nationally-mandated program requiring two waste sorting activities (Int-BG-1). These are sorting organic waste, to dispose of it via composting, and sorting recyclable waste as another disposal method. However, they are very small-scale activities leading to waste composting and, in the case of recycling, the only task performed by the municipality is the collection of recyclables from commercial areas that ends with its delivery to a local CSO of recyclers (Int-BG-3, Int-BG-4). Waste disposal at the dump does not exist in the structure and the only attention it receives is that of a marginalized security guard (Int-BG-23). Except for the dumpsite, all other areas of the waste suboffice have a supervisor and personnel. Therefore, the overall hierarchical relationships in this municipality are straight forward, with all area supervisors reporting directly to the waste suboffice deputy manager. Sicuani. Sicuani is like Bagua Grande in its loose, informal approach to the internal organizational structure of its waste suboffice. Waste collection in this municipality comprises 144 both waste bag pick up from the streets and street sweeping. The entire service is provided and fully managed by two community-based CSOs, one for the west or left margin of the city and the other for the east or right margin. Thus, while not a formal area, collection is organized as one service component on its own, unlike what is observed in Bagua Grande (Int-SI-1, Int-SI-4, Int-SI-6). What is unusual in this case is that, since waste collection is completely managed and run by two CSOs, the service does not have permanent municipal employees assigned to it, further signaling the informal position of this task in the suboffice’s internal structure. However, the service is financed with the budget of a public cleaning investment project that is structurally dependent on Environmental Office and directly overseen by the waste suboffice even though the project has its own project manager (Int-SI-4). This means that, in terms of internal accountability, the waste collection service is monitored by two principals: the waste suboffice deputy manager and the public cleaning project manager (Int-SI-1). Sicuani’s two disposal-related areas are composting and the dumpsite, which have a similar informal treatment in the suboffice structure as that of collection (Int-SI-6). Composting is performed by temporary municipal employees as is not associated with the dumpsite (Int-SI-7). In the case of the dumpsite, unlike Bagua Grande, Sicuani does have municipal employees assigned to conduct work on it. Yet, these composting and dumpsite workers formally belong to the suboffice and not to a specific composting and dumpsite unit within the suboffice’s structure since they do not exist (Int-SI-2, Int-SI-7). This means that both tasks are overseen by the waste suboffice deputy manager, but each is directly managed by a designated supervisor. The public cleaning investment project, however, has a partial oversight role over some activities at the dumpsite, particularly the new leachate tank that was recently constructed (Int-SI-2, Int-SI-4). 145 This means that the dumpsite supervisor reports to two different principals (Int-SI-2). Thus, while this supervisor has direct responsibility to manage the whole dumpsite, under the direction of the waste suboffice deputy manager, the investment project manager is responsible for the new leachate tank and can intervene, make decisions, and give orders to the dumpsite supervisor over this tank and activities related to it without having to coordinate with the waste suboffice deputy manager (Int-SI-2, Int-SI-4). The municipality itself does not conduct any recycling activities, which are independently carried out by the two waste collection CSOs (Int-SI-13, Int-SI-17). However, the suboffice –– and the municipality as a whole–– benefits from the CSOs’ work because it gathers data on quantity recycled from these organizations to report to the nationally-mandated program (Int-SI-14). This data helps the suboffice fulfill some national waste management goal requirements in exchange of an additional annual budgetary support from the Ministry of Finance, provided as an incentive. Satipo. The waste suboffice in Satipo presents the opposite situation. It has a formal internal structure that includes four distinct areas within the organization dedicated to both waste collection and disposal. The areas are: Selective Collection; Street and Public Space Cleaning; Solid Waste Treatment, which includes to subunits such as Waste Reuse ––managing recycling and composting also as two separate tasks–– and Landfill Management, and; Damaged Area Recovery (Int-SA-1). These four areas and the two subunits are each led by a supervisor who oversees a team of workers. Hierarchically, all supervisors report directly to the Waste Suboffice deputy manager. In the case of the two subunits within the Solid Waste treatment area, there is flexibility for their supervisors to report to the overall area supervisor as well as to the Suboffice 146 deputy manager (Int-SA-5, Int-SA-6). Since their work is fairly independent, given their experience and high-level training as environmental engineers, this does not produce major disorders to the structure and hierarchy in the office (Int-SA-1). Core to the waste management activities conducted by these four areas that are part of the Waste Management Suboffice is the interaction with CSOs and civil society at large (Int-SA-4, Int-SA-23). The implementation of waste management strategies needs CSOs and communities to be informed and collaborate with the Suboffice. For instance, sustained interaction is necessary for the adequate sorting of waste into different materials for reuse or final disposal, taking out the correct waste bags at specific times and days, and communicating problem-solving measures (Int-SA-4). Since the Waste Suboffice focuses on the technical and operational aspects of the provision of waste services, the management of community relations in the context of these services are led by another suboffice within the Environmental Office: the Governance and Environmental Quality Integral Management Suboffice (Int-SA-1, Int-SA-23). This unit carries out the central task of involving and informing CSOs in the provision of both waste collection and disposal services. The case of Satipo shows a high level of organizational specialization to provide a differentiated treatment of both waste collection and waste disposal services. This approach is materialized in the way its internal office is formally structured. It is also manifested in the more detailed specialization of the Solid Waste Treatment area ––which is essentially the waste disposal service area–– that is subdivided into two subunits according to the different methods of disposal. At the structural level, these are profound distinctions from what is observed in Bagua Grande and Sicuani that have an informal and loose structure within the suboffice. 147 Conditions and Mechanisms. The existence of a structure is not sufficient on its own, but it is necessary for the implementation of innovative service strategies, especially for the provision of more complex services. The technical, operational, and cost requirements to provide a complex service as waste disposal demand high specialization, and this begins with a formal structure fully focused on its management. Management planning is developed mainly in formally established units in traditional public organizations such as Peruvian municipalities. The same happens for budget allocation and personnel hiring. Thus, having a specialized organizational structure is critical for these services. More importantly, the evidence on collection and disposal performance in the three municipalities ––contrasting Satipo with Bagua Grande and Sicuani–– shows that it is necessary that the specialized suboffice formal structure takes into account the administrative differences between these services that vary in complexity. The assumption that any internal organizational structure ––in which resources are shared across tasks at the suboffice level–– can serve all waste services is inaccurate, at least for the provision (by the same unit) of services that are quite different in complexity. b. Management teams are mainly qualified and experienced to set up collection routines. The professional training and experience of managers is crucial for performance in public service provision (Andrews and Boyne 2010; Avellaneda 2009; Fernandez 2004; Rainey and Steinbauer 1999). This means that their expertise should correspond with the task, especially if the task is more complex or requires specialized knowledge. With the right skills, service operations are run efficiently and problems solved in a timely manner. However, if relevant training and experience is lacking, performance is likely to fail. 148 The qualifications and experience of managers and supervisors are significantly different when comparing waste collection and disposal management in the three municipalities. Findings from fieldwork reveal that all waste managers and supervisors of the Satipo Waste Suboffice are highly trained, with specialized experience in each service. Yet, the waste suboffices in Bagua Grande and Sicuani struggle to hire and retain qualified personnel whose preparation and experience is typically low but sufficient for collection, although not adequate for disposal service provision. This is a critical problem for waste disposal management that requires high technical knowledge and experience. Bagua Grande. The only qualified worker in the Waste Suboffice of Bagua Grande is the person leading it, the waste deputy manager. He is an environmental engineer that has been working in the suboffice in different tasks since 2015 (Int-BG-1). However, most of the supervisors of all waste services, such as the waste pick up, street sweeping, and composting, are former manual labor workers without professional training and management experience in relevant fields (Int-BG-1, Int-BG-2, Int-BG-5, Int-BG-22, Int-BG-27). “The [waste] supervisors, they are from the field … with complete high school but without technical studies,” explained an administrator (Int-BG-1). The exception is the composting supervisor who has a technical degree in agronomy and has been in this position since 2019 (Int-BG-22). No one is assigned to lead or perform work for waste disposal services at the dump (Int-BG-1, Int-BG-23). The evidence illustrates insufficient qualifications to conduct waste management services as a whole but, particularly, the complete abandonment of the disposal service since no one is assigned the task at the supervisory or manual labor levels. 149 Turnover is another problem. This is due to contracts not being immediately renewed for manual labor workers such as compactor truck drivers, bag pickers, and street sweepers (Int-BG-1, Int-BG-2, Int-BG-6, Int-BG-7, Int-BG-10). Thus, in addition to low managerial expertise, the Suboffice is limited by a politically-decided municipal policy of only approving contracts up to three months (Int-BG-1, Int-BG-2, Int-BG-30). The rationale is to minimize worker stability to avoid paying employee benefits (Int-BG-2, Int-BG-22, Int-BG-30). However, a few of workers have been there for years, such as in the composting area, although still under precarious working conditions (Int-BG-21). Waste collection performance is affected due to the learning and adjustment curves its tasks have (Int-BG-1). Despite all the skill limitations, waste collection is adequately provided in this city. Sicuani. Sicuani is led by a few more people at the top of the Suboffice. Its Environmental Office is led by a biologist with more than 10 years of experience in municipal waste management in this city, including serving as deputy manager of its Waste Suboffice (Int-SI-1). This administrator is not currently leading the Suboffice but is very involved in overseeing how it is led. The current deputy manager is a biologist with waste management experience in other municipalities but is new to this position (Int-SI-1, Int-SI-6). The other Suboffice leader in Sicuani’s disorganized internal organizational structure is the public cleaning investment project manager. This person is an agricultural engineer with management experience but in areas unrelated to waste services (Int-SI-4). Since collection services and recycling activities are fully and efficiently provided by to two community CSOs, no major capacity or personnel have been added to the office. 150 None of the three Suboffice management leaders have professional training or experience leading waste disposal services, and landfills or dumpsites in particular (Int-SI-1, Int-SI-4, Int-SI-6). The same occurs with the supervisors overseeing the two disposal-related services provided by the municipality. The dump’s supervisor had one month working in that position and was a recent college graduate with a chemical engineering degree (Int-SI-2). This supervisor was gaining experience on the job, and was already having to manage serious technical problems and personnel conflict at the dump (Int-SI-2). Trying to improve leachate treatment, the supervisor was running some tests with microorganisms. Yet, this was conducted under precarious conditions and using makeshift equipments (Int-SI-3, Ethno-SI-2). Improvised, unsupported attempts proved insufficient for improving the performance of the disposal service. “Leachate treatment beats us, even though we try,” expressed a helpless administrator (Int-SI-1). A similar situation occurs with the composting supervisor, who is a biologist by training with municipal experience but in areas that are unrelated to waste management or composting (Int-SI-7). Turnover among supervisors, staff, and manual labor employees is also high in Sicuani. The Waste Suboffice is affected by a policy limiting contracts between one to three months, and they are typically not immediately renewable. Dumpsite and composting supervisors, office staff, and street sweepers, for instance, are hired each month and dumpsite and composting field workers every three months (Int-SI-1, Int-SI-2, Int-SI-7). Performance is thus affected by the learning curves of these tasks, particularly affecting disposal. Satipo. The Satipo waste Suboffice, on the other hand, is not only led by an environmental engineer but has four environmental or forestry engineers directly supervising its services (Int- 151 SA-1). The supervisor of the Selective Collection area is a forestry engineer that has been on the job for more than two years and has diverse public management experience in different sectors and government levels (Int-SA-3). The Street and Public Space Cleaning supervisor is also a forestry engineer that has been leading the area since 2019 (Int-SA-2). Similarly, for the services related to disposal, the Solid Waste Treatment area supervisor has a technical degree and has been working in the disposal sector in Satipo for 13 years (Int-SA-32). He was part of the unit since before it became a landfill and led the controlled dumpsite at the time, where he acquired detailed technical knowledge on waste disposal management (Int-SA-32). The subunit supervisor for Waste Reuse has two degrees, one in agricultural engineering and another in environmental engineering, and ample experience working in public sector projects, leading teams, and composting (Int-SA-5). The supervisor of the Landfill Management subunit has a degree in environmental engineering with some local level experience on waste disposal (Int-SA-6). Their skills allow them to efficiently apply their knowledge to composting bed control, secure methane management and burning, and leachate treatment, for example. What is additionally important in this Suboffice is that its manual labor workers, for both waste collection and waste disposal, also have ample experience on the tasks they perform. Some have even worked in their positions for years. Their experience has important implications for understanding operational procedures and carrying out tasks with speed and efficiency, which range from street sweeping to managing a backhoe loader, an excavator, or preparing microorganisms for leachate treatment (Int-SA-8, Int-SA-11, Int-SA-14, Int-SA-19). Experience on the job is highly valued on the ground, and managers suffer when turnover of manual labor workers is a regular municipal policy (Int-SA-1, Int-SA-2, Int-SA-3, Int-SA-5, Int-SA-6, Int-SA- 152 36). Skilled manual labor workers are essential for waste disposal due to its high technical requirements. Waste service performance is further strengthened by the work led by the deputy manager of the Governance Suboffice in community relations. This person is also an environmental engineer with relevant experience interacting with communities in the context of environmental management, complementing the skillset in the waste management team (Int-SA-4). Conditions and Mechanisms. The evidence from the three cases illustrates that having, first, people with high levels of relevant skills, training, and experience and, second, assigned to lead the management of the two studied waste services are necessary conditions for performance. These conditions are especially important for a complex service as waste disposal. Having low-skilled managers and supervisors leading a complex service with high technical knowledge requirements is hence detrimental for performance. The concentration of experienced manual labor workers is also crucial as turnover leads to a learning curve that affects a service like disposal but also simple collection tasks. When trying to run operations efficiently, turnover leads to delays and mistakes in waste service provision. The suboffice of Satipo is an exemplary case because it has well-qualified managers, supervisors, and manual labor workers with low turnover for the provision of both collection and disposal. On the contrary, Bagua Grande and Sicuani do not have skilled and experienced managers and staff, with precarious working conditions particularly for those involved in disposal services. Therefore, the evidence shows that even with limited management and personnel skills waste collection services are provided adequately. More importantly, however, it illustrates that personnel qualifications help explain 153 why disposal services underperform and the conditions and mechanisms that lead to higher performance levels. c. Standardized implementation procedures are only available for collection. Procedures are important because they formally and informally establish the working protocols and routines for the management and implementation of public services. When these are unclear, hard to follow, or nonexistent it is easy to confuse those working on the ground ––such as supervisors and manual labor workers–– on how to carry out their jobs, leading to service implementation problems and thus underperformance. Improvisation becomes the norm, and provision is more chaotic with changes in the immediate leadership positions that tend to produce new work processes each time. On the contrary, when service provision procedures are proven to work, standardized, specialized, and followed, implementation is easier, and problems and solutions more quickly identified. More complex services such as waste disposal, therefore, benefit and are more dependent on detailed and standardized procedures relative to more simple services such as waste collection that are based on straightforward routines and tasks. The three cities have standardized waste collection procedures, which is a key element for this service’s high performance. However, in Bagua Grande and Sicuani, disposal tasks –– including those for the dump, composting, and some recycling–– are not structured. Procedures lack formal standardization, complicating task implementation and supervision. Turnover of the few workers assigned to disposal results in the loss of valuable but informal knowledge on procedures, slowing down implementation and increasing errors. Disposal performance is thus diminished. In contrast, in Satipo, all collection and disposal procedures are formally standardized. The teams conduct them as part of the daily routine with occasional coordination 154 with managers or supervisors. They are also capable of addressing problems by quickly and temporarily rearranging the work, which is also based on procedural knowledge. The performance of both services is hence regularly high, showing that procedure standardization is likely necessary for high service outcomes, especially for more complex ones such as disposal. Bagua Grande. On the ground, in Bagua Grande, the routines and resources involved for waste bag pick up and street sweeping are clear and carried out like clockwork. The waste bag picking routine has two schedules, as detailed by the supervisor: There are two shifts in the city. The first shift from 6am to 1pm. Four units go out, two compactor trucks and two dump trucks. A cargo motor tricycle also goes out that helps carry the accumulated trash and take it to the dump truck. They do that near the municipal market, there they pick up: one from 10:30am to 12pm and the other from 2-4pm. The routes are by sector … The second shift, from 1-8pm, covers the outside sectors [of the city] (Int-BG-27). The shifts are done in each sector every other day except in the three accumulation points where they pick up waste daily. The street sweeping routine is performed by all women teams, from 6am to 12pm the morning shift and from 2-4pm the afternoon shift. “From Monday through Friday, all day. Saturday and Sunday, they only do the morning shift,” indicated the street sweeping supervisor (Int-BG-5). For composting, the routines are based on collecting organic waste from 180 households and restaurants, taking it to the small composting facility for a quick cleaning and grinding, and then putting the organic waste in piles (Int-BG-4). After that, waste is moved periodically and treated to eliminate flies and ensure proper decomposition. This process takes approximately 60 days. It receives the careful, methodical supervision of three manual labor workers who take pile 155 temperatures, provide treatment, and move the piles at specific decomposition stages based on the number of days passed. However, since this municipality does not carry out disposal activities at the dump there are no procedures for it. Only occasionally the Suboffice formally coordinates with the Infrastructure Office to have them lend them heavy machinery to remove some waste around so that the trucks can have more access to certain areas of the dump. “We request it every two months but due to the availability of machinery they take five to six months –– we make the requests 10 to 15 days before but not,” noted an administrator (Int-BG-1). This means that waste removal activities at the dump happens twice a year, if at all. Compared to waste bag pickup and street sweeping, procedures for disposal or more specifically for composting are less structured, unsupervised, and lacking in personnel assignment for work deployment. This illustrates that these procedures, while not recently improvised they are not formally standardized and the activities are not documented. If the three manual labor workers were removed from their position the procedures for each composting task would likely have to be rediscovered, relearned, and redesigned. Sicuani. In Sicuani, the collection routines are led by the two community-based CSOs, who plan the routes and teams for both waste bag pick up and street sweeping like clockwork. Each CSO is responsible for one side of the city, with one in charge of the west or left margin and the other of the east or right margin. “The board distributes the routes according to age and stamina, because the routes some are heavy and this way we look to make the work equitable. Each [CSO] partner works twice a year. All work equally, no one more and no one less,” the board members of one of the CSOs indicated (Int-SI-12). Ninety-six women, partners of the CSOs, go 156 out with their brooms and tricycles at 1am to their assigned routes (Int-SI-11, Int-SI-12). All of them work for one month. Each of the CSOs assigns four field supervisors who are also members of the board, and they rotate every other month (Int-SI-13). From Sunday to Friday, they start with the sweeping process of both sides of every street in the urban area, putting all material in their tricycles that each one pushes until their assigned routes are completed (Int-SI-4, Int-SI-6). At approximately 4am they stop at determined points to unload their waste in compactor or dump trucks, whichever is operations on a given night. They get together, chat for a bit, and continue (Int-SI-16, Ethno-SI-9). The collection of waste bags from households and commercial areas begins at 4:30am until around 11am or 1pm, depending on the amount of trash and if the trucks are not having issues. On the other hand, since recycling is carried out independently by the two CSOs without municipal support, the Suboffice does not have any responsibility. Composting procedures are also small-scale in Sicuani and involve: collecting organic waste from market sellers registered to participate in the composting program that are in three different markets, sorting inorganic or plastic material from the organic waste collected, grinding the material, and setting them up in piles (Int-SI-7). Then, the process entails temperature measurement, moving the piles for oxygenation and treatment, cleaning the area, and then moving the piles to another section of the facility according to the number of days that have passed (Int-SI-9, Int-SI-10). Work is performed from 8am to 4pm Mondays, to move piles around and give them treatment, and Tuesdays, and from 8am to 7pm on Wednesdays and Saturdays when they also go to collect the organic waste from markets. At the dump, the tasks performed are focused on manually accommodating the trash unloaded by the trucks (Int-SI-2, Ethno-SI-2, Ethno-SI-3, SSO-DISP-6). This is done three times 157 a day and involves spreading the trash throughout the designated area and burying it with soil using rakes and wheelbarrows. “[The workers] use rakes that actually break the bags. Waste is accumulated in groups or clumps to then get it dispersed. They use wheelbarrows where they carry the soil to throw over the waste” (Int-SI-3). Workers on the site also clean any waste left outside the dump holes, dig and clean leachate holes, build a latrine for their use, and prepare the tracks to safely guide collector trucks to dump in the right places near the holes (Int-SI-5, Ethno-SI-2). A waste management administrator provided details on the work schedule at the dump: Work up at the dump starts at 8:30am –– they get there tired. In practice, the schedule is from 8:30am to 3pm, as the job is finished, but formally it is until 4pm. At 4:30-5am, the security guards open the gate –– they are at night, from 6pm to 6am. Work is from Monday to Sunday but on Saturdays no one is here because there is no [waste] collection (Int-SI-2). While there are some disposal procedures in Sicuani, at the dump and for composting, they are not standardized and are in fact improvised. Thus, these are very basic and insufficient processes to properly treat disposed of waste and the leachate generated in a city of its size. Most of the detailed procedural effort is placed on the collection part of waste management, which is ultimately fully managed by the two CSOs with some logistical support and coordination with the Suboffice. Satipo. Satipo, on the other hand, employs more elaborate processes for the implementation of both its waste collection and disposal activities. The street sweeping process is very much like Bagua Grande and Sicuani and is carried out by term-contract manual labor workers, usually six months and renewable, and are monitored and organized by the area’s supervisor. Each is assigned a route and rotate locations every month (Int-SA-2). This service is carried out 158 overnight, from 2am to 8am to avoid accidents as the streets are narrow and traffic can be heavy. Workers get together at 1am for coordination and equipment checkup. “The average performance per manual worker is a trajectory of 1.5 to 2 linear kilometers per day. I have a street sweeping plan and an Excel with the schedules,” stated a waste administrator denoting the rigor with which the task is planned (Int-SA-2). The area’s supervisor is with them from 1am to 2am twice a week to organize the teams, although still reporting to the Suboffice at 8am. When the supervisor is not present during the overnight shift, the field supervisor, who is also a member of the street sweeping team, takes charge of the group while simultaneously cleaning the assigned route. The other collection service, selective collection, focuses on picking up waste bags and has differentiated routines according to the type of waste. It has four routes, and all are done daily but each day a different type of waste is collected. Compactor trucks are used to pick up organic or disposal waste bags, depending on the day; a stakebed truck29 to collect recyclable waste bags, and; a cargo motor tricycle30 to carry extra waste bags. Each of the trucks has one driver and two waste bag loaders, while the cargo motor tricycle has a driver who also loads bags on the back of the vehicle (Int-SA-3). There are two shifts: the morning shift is done daily, from 7am to 12:30pm, and the afternoon shift from Monday to Friday from 4pm to 5pm. The morning shift collects organic and recyclable waste on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. In the two main routes (1 and 2) that have more population, activity, and are closer to the city center, both trucks go out during those days to collect organic and recyclable waste. Only organic waste is collected in the other two less centric and populated routes (3 and 4) on those days due to vehicle limitations (Int-SA-3). 29 Camión baranda, in Spanish. 30 Motocarguera, in Spanish. 159 Disposable, single-use waste is gathered in the mornings on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays on three routes (1, 2, and 4) using three compactor trucks, one for each route, and one stakebed truck for extra recyclable collection in all those routes. The afternoon shift focuses on collecting waste for one hour from the five markets in the city using two compactor trucks and a cargo motor tricycle. When the routes are finished, only the driver goes to the disposal facility to unload. First, leachate is emptied to a designated sewage pipe that is connected to the leachate tanks and, then, solid waste is unloaded in the section corresponding to the material carried that day, either organic, recyclable, or disposable waste (Int-SA-3). On the other hand, waste disposal is carried out at the disposal facility outside the city deliberately using standardized procedures. Three methods are implemented: recycling, composting, and final disposal on a landfill. All activities start once leachate is emptied from the trucks and right after the material is unloaded in the corresponding area in the facility according to waste type (Int-SA-1, Int-SA-5, Int-SA-6, Int-SA-32). However, the first action taken as trucks arrive to the facility is weighing the vehicles. The person assigned with this task ––who is also the security guard–– handles the weighing process using an electronic scale that has capacity to hold 80 metric tons. This person then transfers all the information into Excel tables once a week to generate graphs based on the time, day, week, month, and by waste type with and without leachate, and when the trucks are ready to leave the facility (Int-SA-7, SSO-DISP-SA-1). The origin of the vehicle is also registered since three other municipalities within the province also dispose of their waste in the facility, based on an agreement with the municipality of Satipo (Int-SA-14, Ethno-SA-2, Ethno-SA-4). The information is used to periodically analyze how much waste is coming in and out, of what type, and changes in their disposal. This is not only to present reports to the deputy manager and the 160 manager of the Environmental Office but mainly to make real-time decisions for the appropriate management and sustainability of the disposal facility (Int-SA-5, Ethno-SA-3). Recycling activities involve separating non-recyclable material that came in the bags and then sorting recyclables by type, such as cans, carboard, colored and white bottles, colored and white paper, plastic, hard plastic, oil bottles, and metal artifacts made of copper, aluminum, and scrap metal (Int-SA-5, Int-SA-9, Int-SA-10, Ethno-SA-1). This is done using a conveyor belt where small materials are placed and passed over to two workers who manually sort the different recyclables and group them into different buckets and large bags. The workers also very quickly remove caps from bottles (Ethno-SA-1). Carboard does not go through the conveyor belt due to its size. After this sorting stage, two or three times a week, all sets of recyclables are firmly compressed together using a press machine and packed into bales. Finally, once a month all bales are weighted and grouped in piles (Int-SA-5). The composting area of the facility has a total of 12 piles or beds, a main leachate channel connected to the leachate tanks through pipes, and a storage area for sawdust and efficient microorganisms (Int-SA-5, SSO-COMP-SA-1). The infrastructure has a tall roof for proper ventilation and oxygenation of the piles. The composting pile formation process consists of first adding a 60 cm layer of sawdust, which is a material that absorbs the leachate generated by the decomposition of organic matter. In this case, it is residual leachate since the compactors that transport this type of waste pass by a leachate extraction process. Then, a compactor enters and deposits the organic waste from the selective collection process in the pile. Once the waste is unloaded, the backhoe loader with its hydraulic arm spreads it evenly. A skid steer loader also intervenes, gathering the waste that fell to the ground and placing it on top of the pile. At the same time three manual labor workers using rakes separate specific organic matter such as 161 coconut shells that due to the hardness of its bark are slow to decompose and delays the process. The workers also separate inorganic waste such as bags and wrappers (Ethno-SA-2, SSO-COMP-SA-1, SSO-COMP-SA-2, SSO-COMP-SA-7). To accelerate the degradation process of organic waste at this stage of the process, 15 to 25 liters of efficient microorganisms are added. These are stored in specialized tanks (called isotanks) with a 1,000-liter capacity connected to a hose that directs the input to the pile. Finally, the skid steer loader adds compost to the process (raw compost, before being sifted), which is distributed throughout the pile creating a layer of approximately 10 to 20 cm. Efficient microorganisms are added again. The process is repeated from the discharge of organic waste, until reaching a maximum height of 2 meters (Int-SA-5, Ethno-SA-2, SSO-COMP-SA-1). The supervisor or his aide take the temperature of the piles using a digital thermometer and a notebook to register this information and the day, time, and pile number where it was taken. After measuring the temperature, piles are moved for ventilation and rotation (Ethno-SA-2). To do this, the skid steer loader moves the product from the last pile to the next designated empty area, and successively rotating other piles (SSO-COMP-SA-5). After 30 to 32 days of organic matter decomposition, the process for obtaining compost ends and this product is transferred to the external part of the plant using the backhoe loader to place it in the dump truck. Finally, the compost is placed in a different area to go through the final sifting process before it is weighted and stored in bags (SSO-COMP-SA-5). All other waste that is not recyclable or compostable goes to the landfill (Int-SA-5). The final disposal of waste in the landfill area, has three main stages carried out in three different areas of the facility: weighting of disposable waste, waste confinement, and leachate treatment (Int-SA-6, Ethno-SA-4). Once the entry weighing process is concluded as describe earlier in this 162 subsection, the trucks are driven to the waste confinement area and more specifically to the disposal hole section which is where all non-reusable waste is unloaded. This is one of two sections of the confinement area. The second is the platform section, which is the old confinement area no longer used to disposed of waste. However, this latter section has a geomembrane and 10 chimneys with valves to manage the treatment of the GhG (i.e., methane) produced from waste disposed of in the past via burning. The disposal hole section is a rectangular area covered by a geomembrane, which is not anchored to the ground (Ethno-SA-4, SSO-DISP-SA-1). It also has 6-inch pipes installed to transport leachate and are covered by stones so that the pipes do not suffer damage when depositing waste. Precarious pipes are also used to conduct rainwater and at the left end of the platform they started a makeshift channel that conducts the water and connects with the rainwater pipe. As the waste disposal progresses, these pipe connections are modified or moved around since they are not part of the drainage that corresponds directly to the rainwater drainage process. Vertical pipes are used to conduct the methane for treatment. These pipes have holes separated by 10 to 12cm, surrounded by stones so that waste cover material does not enter the pipes and are secured by a metal mesh. As the amount of waste disposed in the area increases and covered waste in the holes grows horizontally, more methane treatment pipes are added and the existing ones made taller (Int-SA-6, SSO-DISP-SA-1). The confinement area as a whole has about 75% of free space (Ethno-SA-4, SSO-DISP-SA-1). This is the result of organized work and the expertise of supervisors and manual labor workers that ensure that the final disposal of non-reusable waste follows an order. This means that as waste enters the disposal hole section, it is gradually spread evenly throughout the section and cover material is dispersed on top to make layers of 40 to 60 cm. All piles are then 163 compacted with pressure from the backhoe loader’s hydraulic arm until the pile worked that day is uniform (Int-SA-6, Ethno-SA-4, SSO-DISP-SA-2). To carry out the process the disposal facility has machinery such as a backhoe loader, excavator, skid steer loader, and a dump truck. Two manual labor workers are assigned to the Landfill area, with one in charge of the chimneys, and maintenance of the platform, and cleaning and supervising the current disposal hole’s conditions (i.e., cleans the waste that was not covered or moved by the wind or machinery). Finally, leachate treatment consists of two leachate ponds, each lined with a geomembrane. There is a third, smaller tank that is sealed but is not active (Ethno-SA-4, SSO-DISP-SA-1). The first tank receives the leachate from three different parts of the facility: the confinement area, the composting area, and the leachate discharge pipes from the compactor trucks (SSO-DISP-SA-1, SSO-DISP-SA-4). It has a roof and intersecting iron railings above the tank as safety to avoid people or animals from falling inside. The pipe conducting leachate discharged by the compactor trucks is superficially placed on top of a mesh with fine filters that retain the solids that are brought in the discharge. On the side of the tank, there is an efficient microorganism treatment area with two large containers, one with active microorganism and the other in the process of being activated. A small, motorized pump is used to load leachate into a tanker truck that is driven around the disposal facility dispersing leachate on the soil as a means of supposedly recirculating and letting leachate evaporate faster. The second leachate tank is not active, but they used to apply physical treatment to the leachate using activated carbon, stone, and gravel filters. Currently these filters are overloaded and no longer fulfill their function, which is why they hope to drain the water/leachate to change the material (Int-SA-6, Ethno-SA-4, SSO-DISP-SA-1). 164 During my fieldwork research, the municipality was affected by political instability due to political polarization and an alleged corruption. The mayor and top managers in Satipo were sent to jail, including the head of the Environmental Office. However, the Waste Suboffice teams kept working like clockwork, without problems. This situation is illustrative of the way waste services are handled. Waste collection and disposal work in Satipo are carried out with a high degree of standardization of each of its tasks, based on careful planning. These processes are closely and diligently followed by workers and managers. This case shows how standardized procedures, supplemented by high personnel qualifications (from the top to the bottom of the structure), are important for provision (Int-SA-23, Ethno-SA-3, Ethno-SA-8). Service implementation is hence straightforward and problem-solving is conducted effectively. The detailed level of process standardization observed in the city is particularly beneficial for a complex service such as waste disposal, heavily relying on this methodical work to ensure top efficiency and performance. Conditions and Mechanisms. The diligently planned processes for both collection and disposal in Satipo demonstrate the high level of specialization and standardization for waste service provision led by the Suboffice, compared to the improvised way the provision processes are carried out in their Bagua Grande and Sicuani counterparts. In addition, the level of technical detail involved in the implementation of the waste disposal procedures further illustrates this service’s level of complexity relative to those of waste collection. A key, noteworthy aspect of the Satipo Waste Suboffice is that their standardized disposal procedures are supported by the disposal facility’s operational plan, which is closely followed and recognized as useful for the management of the activities within it (Int-SA-5). This strength in their procedures further 165 protected the work of Satipo’s Waste Suboffice in a context of political turmoil. However, to achieve the standardization levels found in this city, and particularly for a more complex service such as waste disposal, it requires a highly qualified management team leading activities both in the office and the field. This is not present in the other two suboffices. Based on the evidence, procedure standardization and specialization are necessary for high service performance, particularly for more complex ones such as waste disposal. The differences observed across procedures of the two waste services within a Suboffice and across the three suboffices are partly the result of the qualifications gaps found office and field management teams. The limitations in training and experience found in Bagua Grande and Sicuani, in turn, interact with the pressure received from the population and local politicians to prioritize addressing the immediate problems of visible and salient services. Thus, implementation procedures in these two localities are centered on the provision of waste collection. d. High competition for heavy machinery with multiple offices. Another common issue confronted by the Suboffices underperforming in the provision of waste disposal is the lack of equipment. Particularly, heavy machinery is essential for several critical disposal tasks, such as moving all the waste unloaded by the trucks at the dump or landfill to specific parts of a hole to disperse, accommodate, and compress it. This disposal activity is necessary to make neat piles and use the space available efficiently. It also helps assemble layers of waste, sawdust, and other materials. All this work requires permanently having heavy machinery available, such as a 166 backhoe loader,31 excavator,32 skid steer loader,33 and dump truck,34 among others. While this type of machinery is readily available in Satipo, the waste suboffices in Bagua Grande and Sicuani face significant delays and difficulties accessing them, instituting an additional complication to waste disposal performance. Bagua Grande and Sicuani. In Bagua Grande and Sicuani, the suboffices compete with other more politically salient tasks such as infrastructure construction. The reason is that their waste suboffices do not own any of these machines. All are owned by the Infrastructure Office, which decides how to schedule their use throughout the year. The Bagua Grande suboffice, for instance, typically has access to these heavy machines once or twice a year because of the lack of political priority of waste disposal at the dump, supplemented by poor managerial planning and skill (Int-BG-1, Int-BG-14). Sicuani faces the same situation. The Suboffice has to enter into a larger municipal lottery with all other units requesting this equipment. “We are missing machinery such as a backhoe loader and dump truck — they come here every 15 days but it is necessary for them to be exclusive [to disposal]. In the municipality we practically raffle [the machines] between different projects –– every Friday there is a raffle but sometimes they give you priority due to urgency,” noted a waste supervisor working in the field (Int-SI-2). Similarly, problems with the compactor truck in these two municipalities force the use of dump trucks, complicating the job of properly disposing of waste (Int-BG-10, Int-BG-14, Int-BG-27, Int-SI-1, Int-SI-2). Since waste collection teams are required to pick up any type of waste bag from the streets ––also adding pressure and risk on collection teams–– this means that waste 31 Cargador frontal or retroexcavadora, in Spanish. 32 Excavadora, in Spanish. 33 Minicargador, in Spanish. 34 Camión volquete, in Spanish. 167 comes unsorted to the dump. This produces two problems for disposal: first, more waste would come into the holes, reducing space and thus its sustainability and duration over time, and; second, collected bags will include more organic waste than the usual amount which increases leachate generation and aggravates the already existing problem the dumps in these cities have for adequately treating leachate. Moreover, many times due to the urgency to gather all bags from the streets quickly when the compactor truck does not work, it brings hospital waste (Int-BG-6, Int-SI-3, Ethno-BG-1, Ethno-SI-2). Of course, hospital waste is not an unusual sight at the Bagua Grande and Sicuani dumps (Ethno-BG-1, Ethno-BG-7, Ethno-SI-2, and Ethno-SI-3). These vehicle problems emerge from poor maintenance planning, because they are old, or sometimes are the result of unexpected events such as flat tires (Int-SI-20). While unexpected flat tires do happen in all three municipalities, Bagua Grande and Sicuani are the ones facing serious issues in the daily operation of their compactor trucks. “Sometimes maintenance is not done on time … We still go out but the machines can be damaged. Maintenance planning is necessary … I’m doing the maintenance myself” explained a vehicle operator (Int-SI-20). Waste collection workers tend to lack basic protective equipment, work clothes, adequate brooms, and dustpans, but this does not significantly limit their ability to carry out the service and their specific tasks (Int-BG-6, Int-BG-10, Int-BG-21, Int-SI-9, Int-SI-14, Int-SI-18). Limited equipment is more extensive and consequential in the case of disposal (Int-BG-30, Int-SI-2, Int-SI-5). Other key disposal equipments are also absent in Bagua Grande and Sicuani. This includes tools or infrastructure such wheelbarrows, rakes, shovels, for moving waste and setting up dump piles (Int-SI-3, Int-SI-5); organic waste bags to bring material to a composting facility, organic waste grinders, thermometers, and pH meters for compost management (Int-BG-21, Int-BG-22, 168 Int-SI-7, Int-SI-9, Int-SI-10); full face respirators to avoid breathing methane and goggles; scales; inputs for leachate treatment (Int-BG-21, Int-SI-5, Ethno-SI-2); roofed leachate tanks (Ethno-SI-2); geomembranes under the disposal holes and leachate tanks (Int-SI-3, Ethno-SI-2); leachate pipes, and; basic utilities such as electricity and water (Int-SI-3, Int-SI-5). Satipo. Waste collection workers and tasks, for the most part, are well-equipped in Satipo and face very minimal problems to carry out the service efficiently (Int-SA-2, Int-SA-18, Int-SA-19, Ethno-SA-7, Ethno-SA-8). Contrary the other two cases, the Satipo Waste Suboffice owns its own heavy machinery exclusively for disposal activities due to the importance that this service has in this municipality and the commitment of its managers at the office level (Int-SA-1, Int-SA-6, Int-SA-14). The teams have most of these disposal equipments at the facility (Ethno-SA-2, Ethno-SA-4). Yet, they face some problems of unstable electricity system although it is an issue of the city as a hole due to high demand that they address by rearranging activities temporarily (Int-SA-8). Conditions and Mechanisms. The unequal allocation of resources between collection and disposal is therefore a source of major performance problems affecting the latter, increasing the gap between the two services. Not having regular access to heavy machinery for waste disposal like in Bagua Grande and Sicuani is especially detrimental for the provision of waste disposal, which is not a major problem these municipalities have for collection as they have the necessary equipment or can do the job with makeshift tools. Having all the equipment for each service is particularly important for the performance of complex ones, while simple services can manage. 169 4.1.3 Field Workers Workers in the field include supervisors, coordinators, and manual labor workers. Waste workers in these positions, especially manual labor workers and indigenous women, tend to be marginalized both by society and their municipal employers. It is a problem that is not limited to Peru (Fredericks 2009, 2018; Kaza et al. 2018). Regardless of whether they work on collection or disposal, manual labor workers and field supervisors in the waste sector experience discriminatory treatment. Unlike municipal waste staff inside the office, that are typically better paid and work under more comfortable and safe conditions, waste employees picking up waste from the streets or treating waste for disposal are underpaid, neglected, and exposed to high risk levels. Manual labor waste workers are poorly paid (USD 240 to USD 309 per month), highly exposed to risk, face job insecurity, have unstable contracts, are marginalized and verbally abused by society, and receive differential treatment relative to office workers within the local government (Int-BG-6, Int-BG-10, Int-BG-21, Int-SI-5, Int-SI-11). This situation affects worker motivation and wellbeing (Colquitt et al. 2007; Hameduddin and Fernandez 2019; Isen and Reeve 2005; Lyubomirsky et al. 2005) although they remain on the job. However, disposal workers face an additional problem: they are not seen on a daily basis relative to waste pickers on the streets. This is because while waste pickers are seen walking through the streets, dumps are located on the city’s periphery. This means that management evaluates the challenges of the job performed by disposal workers as being equal as those faced by waste pickers. 170 Table 4.4. Field worker treatment and conditions Categories Bagua Grande Sicuani Satipo Collection Unbiased Treatment Poor High High Work conditions Poor High High Morale Poor High High Disposal Unbiased Treatment Poor Poor High Work conditions Poor Poor High Morale Poor Poor High Sources: Fieldwork. Notes: Category classifications are: none, poor, moderate, and high. a. Low morale and sense of discrimination among field workers, especially in disposal. Waste workers feel undervalued as the pay is low and working conditions tend to be precarious. This sentiment affects all municipal workers in the sector: truck and cargo motor tricycle drivers, waste bag pickers, street sweepers, route supervisors, organic waste collectors, composting treatment workers, recyclers, disposal hole and leachate workers, and disposal area supervisors. While in Satipo this situation is less severe and, in many cases, adequate, disposal workers in Sicuani and the security guard in Bagua Grande ––who is the only employee there–– face the direst working conditions. Poor relative treatment between collection and disposal workers ––from discrimination, deficient working conditions, and low morale–– is another critical factor for the observed performance gaps between the two waste services. Bagua Grande. In Bagua Grande, waste workers are full-time municipal employees paid as little as 930 Peruvian Soles or USD 240 each month, which was the minimum salary in 2021. Many of them are heads of household for families with more than three members, including children, and are thus forced to find occasional manual labor jobs in their spare time. “The salary is not enough 171 and they have to find other ways to make money,” said a temporary collection supervisor and truck driver (Int-BG-2). They can hardly make a decent living. One waste worker’s comment exemplifies this reality: We do this out of necessity … We don’t have any benefits … and all for the minimum salary, even though we risk much. We are at 30 to 31 [Peruvian Soles, or USD 7.73 to USD 7.99] per day. A laborer earns more. I have three kids with 930 [Peruvian Soles], plus a brother with a disability for whom I am responsible. It’s not enough. During my spare time I work on my parcel [to support ourselves] (Int-BG-10). Their contracts last for three months and are unusually renewed. “We are out [of work] for three months due to the contract issue. If you are lucky you return, there are many looking [for this job],” noted another waste worker (Int-BG-11). Added to the low pay and employment insecurity is the high risk they constantly face. They run toward the truck carrying heavy bags that may include broken glass and used needles, dodging traffic, for instance, and drive around not in specialized compactor trucks but on top of plastic waste bags on the borders of dump trucks (Int-BG-6, Int-BG-7). “Drivers give us alcohol. And according to the wound they give us days off … we stay quiet unless it’s serious … There is no protocol for accidents. The gloves don’t protect us from broken glass or needles,” stressed a bag collector (Int-BG-7). One of the drivers explained: That is why there are accidents –– those of us in public cleaning are not well protected. We receive one uniform per year that is contaminated … We must be the first ‘wash and wear’ –– I washed [my uniform] last night to put on today. Worse during the pandemic … We are mistreated but asked to give a good service. But if there are accidents, they are separated and no longer continue working. Those of us in solid waste are the last (Int-BG-6). 172 To worsen their working conditions, these waste collectors endure mistreatment from society. Citizens who are irritated with the municipality’s overall service provision, angered by waste management in Bagua Grande, or just urged to have their waste bags removed from their front doors release their frustrations toward waste collectors on the streets. Three collection workers described how friends and family also make belittling remarks: In the streets and your friends disparage you. They tell you ‘hey brother, isn’t there a superior job’ or instead ‘get a job!’ (Int-BG-9). People treat us as the worst –– we receive insults to our mothers; they get upset because we don’t go [to their streets since] they take out [their bags] outside the scheduled time or due to lack of coordination (Int-BG-6). Even if they see you wounded, it’s fine. ‘You are kept’ they tell us. We are very criticized by the majority; the population does not value us (Int-BG-10). These expressions show how lowly waste collectors are regard essentially due to the type of job and sector they are employed in. Working with waste, even if it is a service to all the community, is evidently perceived as a demeaning, worthless, or inferior job done by people undeserving of respect and dignity. While the few disposal workers employed in Bagua Grande face similar problems as collection workers ––and considering that disposal is a relatively more complex waste service–– there are qualitative differences in terms of the lack of overall support for the service and thus ignorance over its challenges for workers. A composting worker made a comment that revealed their working conditions: 173 The smell is strong and affects the lungs later due to the strong vapor from ammonia. But we endure out of necessity. Despite the masks we are given [the smell is still felt]. We are not given anything here to detoxify … I know that later it will affect us; we have told [management] but they do not take it into account because they do not live it and we do (Int-BG-21). Full face respirators are basic equipment for organic waste composting, particularly for worker safety and health, but they are not provided by this Waste Suboffice despite having only a very small-scale composting facility and three workers. Not providing a key protective equipment denotes a biased treatment. When the workload is heavy, employees also feel unappreciated and exploited. Even though this area requires at least five manual labor workers, it only does the job with three and “sometimes they even take personnel to see other topics, for support, and they take them away every one to two months [from the composting area]” (Int-BG-22). The only worker at the dump, who is a security guard, is completely unnoticed and even forgotten. This employee is essentially abandoned. There is no supervision of the work. The night shift worker has never been seen and no one at the Suboffice has complained about it (Int-BG-23, Ethno-BG-1, Ethno-BG-5, Ethno-BG-7). There is no place to warm up food, no restroom, and no electricity for light, air conditioning, or a fan. “Because there is no power here, I cannot ask for a fan,” said the dump’s security guard, even though temperatures are typically very warm in this locality (Int-BG-23). This worker has a very delicate health condition and high stress from over 30 years working in the waste sector: Yesterday I felt ill but still had to come. When I get up my body hurts. I am afraid, I have been told I could have a stroke. I have a 10-year-old girl that I am still raising, I am afraid that my girl will be left alone. Since I don't like to complain, I just come (Int-BG-23). 174 Moreover, the dump’s security guard has confronted serious legal problems due to an accident while working for the municipality behind the compactor truck loading waste bags: It was five years ago … I had an accident and he [the mayor at the time] did not support me. Someone died in the car … the person unloading told me to compress the waste [but] he got inside to get something … his head was squeezed. The mayor did not support saying it was an accident. I was sued (Int-BG-23). This occurred while on the job, which means that the municipality should have taken legal and material responsibility over the problem. Instead, they abandoned this worker to confront it individually. This situation reveals two problems: lack of care for manual labor workers and discrimination due to the type of job and socioeconomic background of workers, especially those in the waste sector. Section 4.1.1 of this chapter further discusses bias toward waste workers from top leadership. Thus, to avoid further complications and because the municipality could not get rid of this employee, they sent this person to a place where workers no longer exist: the dump. While it is clear that all waste workers are mistreated and hence have low morale, the dump’s security guard carries out the job in oblivion. Collection is affected by how workers feel treated, but given that it is a relatively simple task it is still adequately provided. For waste disposal, guarding who comes into the dump is crucial to control the amount and safety of disposed waste, helping protect the dump’s sustainability. Yet, this service can hardly be carried out well with just one worker whose job is to guard the main entrance. Less so with a mistreated, neglected worker with a diminished motivation. Thus, it is evident that this dump worker receives, relative to collection workers, the lowest consideration and accommodation from the Suboffice to carry out the job, further reducing disposal performance. 175 Sicuani. Similarly, in Sicuani, waste workers are discriminated against and those at the dump are especially misunderstood. All waste workers earn 1,200 Peruvian Soles, or USD 309, monthly. They are hired to work for a month, two or three times a year, depending to the agreement between the municipality and the community CSOs. Collection women, who are members of the two community kitchen CSOs, highlight mistreatment from the population demanding to pick up all sorts of waste. This includes bags full of construction material and tiles that are significantly heavy to carry and damages the tricycles they use to gather waste from the streets. Since they carry out their jobs overnight, they confront higher risk of safety and accidents from intoxicated individuals walking in the streets or driving vehicles. “That is why we work in pairs,” stated a lady that has been in one of the two collection CSOs for 26 years (Int-SI-18). However, overall, the CSOs’ collection teams have expressions of gratitude and appreciation toward the municipality for the opportunity given to their members to do this job. “We interact with the Environmental Office through our board … We have always worked cordially, we have had no problem, we always talk,” added a lady working on collection (Int-SI-18). On the contrary, disposal workers are more clearly marginalized. At the composting facility, the workers feel underestimated. They have no power, water, and restrooms and so they have to figure out makeshift, resourceful solutions with borrowed materials from family and other municipal units to address these limitations and fulfill their duties. Their work is unacknowledged despite the obstacles and effort, as reflected in a comment by a composting worker: 176 The fact that you are telling me that we have achieved a lot in very little time, that motivates me, that my work gets recognition … I would like to reward the team a lot but the biologist says ‘no.’ I motivate them explaining them the job. It is hard for all of us to find a job and so I tell them that we will receive a paycheck at the end of the month and that keeps us going (Int-SI-7). Workers at the dump face even greater difficulties to do their jobs with dignity. Although the conditions for disposal are blatantly problematic, particularly at the dump, a waste manager stated “yes, I have everything [for disposal], it is adequate” (Int-SI-6). However, a group of disposal workers at the dump, who are also members of the indigenous community who owns the property, talked about their experience illustrating a completely different context: We walk up a very steep hill, for 1 hour and a half from our community, to work at the dumpsite. We get here [at 12,500 ft.] very exhausted ... There is no restroom to wash ourselves or shower [after moving waste around] … there is no water [or] electricity … We are terribly treated … There is nothing to enjoy (Int-SI-5). To make matters worse, these workers have not been paid their first two months of work. Disposal workers’ differential, discriminatory, and undignified treatment is thus evident from these accounts. The infrastructural conditions to carry out their jobs further exemplifies the extent of the problem. The camp area of the dump has a small room where two workers sleep during the overnight shift to watch over the few equipments they have. There are two old beds and two wood planks over brick used as benches. Another rest area on the way up to the dump holes consists of a bed placed directly on the ground and is covered with plastic bags that are sustained by four vertical and four horizontal logs to protect them from the sunshine. To test and 177 prepare the chemicals and microorganisms for leachate treatment, the dump’s supervisor uses a badly-built, narrow shack barely fitting three people (Ethno-SI-2, Ethno-SI-3). Waste collection workers in Sicuani receive a more favorable treatment compared to workers at the dump. The former do not express complains about neglect or discrimination from the Suboffice. In fact, they recognize how well supported their members and the two CSOs are by municipal administrators. Their motivation leads them to do a good job in collection. However, disposal workers feel largely marginalized, discriminated, and working under non dignified conditions. Despite their communications with the Suboffice about these problems, they still receive no response –– they are left on their own. Morale is low, affecting disposal performance more. Satipo. The conditions of all waste workers are significantly better in Satipo. There is no significant difference in terms of treatment and morale. Both collection and disposal workers tend to be highly committed, motivated, and receive respect and support from managers and local authorities (Int-SA-5, Int-SA-10, Int-SA-13, Int-SA-19, Int-SA-13, Ethno-SA-3, Ethno-SA-5, Ethno-SA-7, Ethno-SA-8). They are also generally well equipped with all necessary materials and resources to support their jobs and safety in the streets while collecting waste and at the disposal facility (Int-SA-14, Int-SA-20). Although some field workers express a desire for a better salary, they are generally satisfied and content (Int-SA-6, Int-SA-9, Int-SA-10, Int-SA-12). However, some waste workers do express a sense of discrimination from Suboffice managers and other municipal authorities that ignore their efforts as they feel they their strong commitment to the job goes unappreciated (Int-SA-9, Int-SA-18, Int-SA-22). Managers and supervisors do make efforts to regularly have conversations and show openness to address 178 feelings such as these, including eating lunch and playing sports together, keeping the teams committed (Int-SA-2, Int-SA-3, Ethno-SA-3, Ethno-SA-5, Ethno-SA-7). Therefore, contrary to the other two cases, waste worker treatment in Satipo is generally positive and constructive, adding to the factors that explain high performance in both collection and disposal services in this city. Conditions and Mechanisms. Field workers in the waste sector tend to be discriminated against, work under difficult and risky conditions, and have a low morale. However, the evidence shows that waste disposal workers tend to experience this type of treatment more severely and are neglected by top leadership and managers. Disposal workers in Bagua Grande and Sicuani candidly illustrated their terrible situation, showing that this is likely an important factor diminishing the performance of this service. While collection workers are also affected by poor treatment and working conditions, the state of abandonment is not as critical as observed in disposal. Despite the low morale in collection, the service continues to be adequately provided possibly because it is relatively simple. This means that the performance of a simple service, although improved by worker motivation according to the literature, is not significantly reduced by these treatment issues. This observation could be explained by the fact that low income workers, such as those in waste collection, need the paycheck urgently so they try to complete the task as best they can given the limitations. The evidence also illustrates that poor treatment compensated by workers’ livelihood needs is not sufficient to improve disposal performance. However, when workers receive more dignified treatment and working conditions, increasing their morale, both waste services are 179 more likely to perform highly. The performance of a complex service is especially benefitted by having more committed and focused workers, as a result of such treatment, as found in the case of Satipo. Thus, worker treatment, conditions, and morale are necessary for high service performance, but has significant implications for the adequate provision of complex services such as waste disposal. 4.2 Conclusions In this chapter, I argue that having specialized administrative capacity is necessary for improved performance in public service provision, especially for complex services such as waste disposal. The evidence on waste management services shows that municipalities can provide simple services well without optimal administrative capacity, as observed for waste collection. However, lacking the required administrative capacity specific for the provision of a complex service leads to deficient performance levels. When service implementation depends on high operational and technical knowledge, general or improvised capabilities cannot compensate for limitations in those areas. Local governments that build the administrative capacity tailored for a complex service are more likely to have high-performance levels. Given that the core puzzle of this chapter regarding service provision is the underperformance of disposal services relative to collection in terms of administrative capacity, three sets of conditions are identified as necessary for better service outcomes in both collection and disposal. First, it is necessary for top municipal leadership ––including politicians and managers–– to be committed to and aware of the specific implementation implications of complex services. Decision-makers tend to be mindful of the requirements of simple services such as collection, hence providing regular support. After all, these are more politically and 180 socially visible services. However, they superficially understand the demands of a complex one as disposal (Kahneman 2002). This partly indicates that services with lower technical complexity and higher political and social salience will benefit from more support, and thus have greater performance (Avellaneda 2012; Bélanger and Meguid 2008). Better attention from decision-makers to the specialized needs of complex service operations and their technical aspects would lead to more accurate assessments and higher prioritization of these services. Second, administrative specialization within the management office is necessary for better complex service outcomes. Simple services like collection can continue being provided under fragile, improvised administrative contexts at the management office level. Complex services like disposal cannot. Differentiated organizational structure, team qualifications, policies and procedures, and equipment corresponding to such service’s requirements are essential for improved performance. Third, field worker treatment must be unbiased, receiving respect and recognition regardless of the task. In the case of waste services, there is a difference in the conditions and exposure to prejudice if they pick up waste in the streets compared to those covering dump holes outside the city limits. All waste workers tend to be disparaged by municipal authorities and society. Yet, disposal workers are not seen ––because dumps are far away–– and therefore, their challenges are misunderstood or entirely ignored. On the other hand, these findings have crucial implications for public administration research and policy-making. For research, first, they show that performance gaps between simple and complex services can be more precisely understood by looking at service-specific administrative capacity. To do so, it helps to disaggregate the analysis by appropriate hierarchical levels. In this case, three levels are identified: top leadership, management office, 181 and field workers. Each level has distinctive capacity features that, according to the findings, contribute to the performance of waste services such as simple collection and complex disposal. This means that municipal administrative capacity varies, even for services in the same office and policy domain –– more so when services are more complex. Thus, general capacity measures likely do not capture what we expect. Second, this approach helps identify more accurate or tighter research measures so that analyses capture what is intended. Third, this approach provides a more detailed understanding of performance by unpacking the analyses of services and service performance based on their complexity level, instead of assuming all services are equal. Finally, for public administration research more broadly, this chapter shows the richness that collecting qualitative data provides for assessing administrative capacity and service performance. For policy, the evidence goes beyond simple, “low-hanging fruit” policy solutions. When faced with performance problems, typical immediate reactions from decision-makers may include hiring managers and teams with better general training to take care of the rest. Increasing the overall office budget to procure needed equipment or use it to hire experts directly is another similar approach. The findings from this chapter provide insights with a nuanced perspective for service provision when services vary in complexity, using the case of waste. First, non-specialized capacity is crucial to a simple service, such as cleaning the streets. Waste collection is a resilient service that does not require much specialized organizational structure, personnel qualifications, intricate procedures, and equipment. This means municipalities with resource limitations may likely continue cleaning the city streets. Second, strengthening municipal service-specific administrative capacity is an essential investment for performance improvements in complex service provision. Fundamental measures 182 include: specializing the organizational structure for the management of this service, hiring and retaining team members with specific technical qualifications and experience, drafting detailed policies and procedures for such service’s administration, and acquiring specialized equipment for service operations. In this case, it is critical to reinforce the specific capacity within the office for this service type. Third, a holistic approach to administrative capacity is fundamental, focusing on the needs of a specific service, mainly if it is complex. This means that for a given service, it is necessary to assess the structure, policies and procedures, human resources, equipment, and how compassionate the leadership is with field workers. Finally, the perspective of policy-makers about services matters. This implies that distinguishing policy measures by service complexity would help address service performance issues effectively. If heavily concentrated on simple services or the superficial aspects of more complex services, decision-making will likely be flawed or biased. This is especially important for those services with environmental sustainability implications and weak, vulnerable Global South cities. 183 References Andrews, Rhys and George Boyne. 2010. \"Capacity, Leadership, and Organizational Performance: Testing the Black Box Model of Public Management.\" Public Administration Review 70(3): 443-454.

CSOs are not significantly involved in waste services in Bagua Grande. The relationship with the municipality is weak or inexistent and many local authorities do not know much about them. Other municipal leaders see them as weak organizations of poor, uneducated people. CSO are thus typically absent or may have a distant, indirect involvement in service implementation. While some community CSOs used to sporadically participate in waste collection before the pandemic, today, no relationship exists with the Waste Suboffice. One CSO in particular gathers recyclables at a very small scale, although with minimal interaction with the Suboffice (see Figure 5.1). While this helps with reducing waste build-up and contamination at the dump, it is likely trivial. A couple of CSO members routinely drive a motor tricycle freely inside the dump, where large amounts of waste have accumulated and rotted for years without municipal treatment. They walk around the area for a few minutes until they find a deep, rich waste pile from where they could gather recyclables. They dive through the mounds using only a rake and a bag, many times without gloves or masks. They typically fill up two to four sacks after many hours of work –– the heat and the smell are weakening (see Figure 5.2). They collect for their own purposes, part of their livelihood strategies. They go there hoping to find a few valuable items they could later sell but without any real organizational plan. None of this is done as part of a policy or systematic coordination with the Suboffice to address local waste disposal problems, which is why they have not been instrumental in improving waste disposal. CSOs are relatively disengaged from waste services. They struggle with internal management, affecting membership engagement and making their activities dependent on 188 occasional leadership proactivity if their board members have those skills. Their organizational mission is led by immediate livelihood needs of sporadic members, resulting in no planning, rather than on an overall community development approach based upon a prepared strategy. Their organizational and membership issues have restricted their ability to interact with the local government systematically. This has thus led to relevant impact on waste collection and disposal performance. Figure 5.1. Municipal driver delivering plastic bottles to CSO for recycling in Bagua Grande Notes: Author photograph (2021). 189 Figure 5.2. CSO members collecting recyclable material at the dump in Bagua Grande Notes: Author photograph (2021). Next, when you visit Sicuani’s Waste Management Suboffice you are likely to run into at least one of the leaders of the two community CSOs managing the city’s waste collection services. Misinformed stereotypes may lead quite a few people unacquainted with them to think that they are in the building to ask for social assistance. Racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic discrimination may even lead many other municipal workers to ignore or mistreat them. Because of their racial features and outfits showing their indigenous identity, these admirable and hardworking women are not unfamiliar with disparaging attitudes toward them due to their heritage. But these women are in the office to talk about some critical business for the city. After all, they single-handedly manage the entire waste collection service achieving optimal results (see Figure 5.3). Different reasons motivate their visits to the Suboffice: service problem-solving coordination with managers, providing members’ employment documents, and building relationships to ensure the continued support of their CSOs’ work in collection. Managers from 190 the waste and environmental offices also visit the CSOs’ facilities sometimes, for work meetings or to participate in the CSOs’ annual festivities. Cordiality and trust are features of their interactions, especially with the Environmental Office manager who fully supports them after years of work together serving the city. The fact is that the municipality needs them because it cannot provide this waste service on its own, even though some administrators believe otherwise. More importantly, perhaps, despite their poverty, or because of it, these CSOs have a very clear organizational strategy, driven by their members’ needs. This is reflected through their efficient operation of the service, which explains why they have done the job so well for 31 years. On the other hand, leaders of the CSO involved in waste disposal are rarely seen walking through the Suboffice’s hallways to hold planning or problem-solving conferences with waste administrators. In fact, they are waiting for managers to visit and present to them their solutions for the dump’s mismanagement, which is in their property. While interactions are rare, when they occur mutual distrust is evident, making it hard to address any past and ongoing grievances. This indigenous community CSO does not seem to have drafted an organizational strategy to tackle the damages to their community from inadequate waste disposal service, with or without the municipality. Ultimately, they have not been instrumental in waste disposal performance improvements (see Figure 5.4). 191 Figure 5.3. CSO members conducting the waste collection service in Sicuani Notes: Author photograph (2021). The image shows CSO members cleaning the city, a task for which they are entirely in charge. Figure 5.4. CSO members working at the dump in Sicuani Notes: Author photograph (2021). The image shows a dump full of mismanaged waste bags with a few CSO members manually carrying out tasks. Finally, CSOs in Satipo coordinate regularly with the municipality to engage their communities in waste sorting and receive approval to their waste disposal activities. To do so, they meet with staff from the Governance Suboffice to receive training on waste and other environmental issues and think of ways to collectively participate. For collection, leaders gather the community together to train members, making sure that they sort their waste bags by reusables and non-reusables. For disposal, leaders report back to the community with any 192 negotiation outcomes regarding how the disposal facility is working, especially regarding smell control when leachate is not properly treated. These CSOs are focused on community development, leading their organizations to reach out, negotiate with the municipality, and devise strategies that will benefit most or all members. Access to services and wellbeing is at the core of what leaders do. These organizations have three crucial organizational capabilities: engaged human resources, organizational strategy, and leadership commitment and skills that are relevant to the specific service. Thus, their capabilities produce an effective participation in both waste services. While the Waste Suboffice conducts collection and disposal services efficiently throughout the city, and hence CSO involvement in service provision is not direct, their contribution on these services’ performance is crucial. Particularly, despite disposal’s relative complexity, CSOs’ demands have helped ensure proper municipal management of waste disposal (see Figure 5.5). Figure 5.5. CSO member working at the landfill in Satipo Notes: Author photograph (2021). The image shows the landfill area of the disposal facility. Neat waste piles are found after one hour of work with heavy machinery carried out by the facility’s personnel, who are mostly CSO members. This work is done after the collection trucks unload all the waste in the landfill. 193 All these conditions of CSO involvement in the three municipal case studies are summarized in Table 5.1 below. Table 5.1. CSO involvement general conditions Categories Bagua Grande Sicuani Satipo Municipal Capacity to Manage CSO Involvement Poor Moderate High Perceptions of CSO Characteristics Negative Moderate Positive CSO Organizational Capacity Poor Moderate Moderate Waste Service Involvement Collection Poor High Moderate Disposal Poor Poor Moderate Sources: Fieldwork. Notes: Category classifications are: none, poor, moderate, and high. The category on “perceptions of CSO characteristics” refers to those from municipal workers and the classifications are: negative, moderate, positive, and indifferent. The indifferent classification means that the category was not expressed as relevant. In this chapter I will show four main patterns regarding the participation of community CSOs in waste service provision. The first two points pertain to their relationship with the municipality, the third to their organizational capacity, and the fourth to the complexity of the service. First, capability within the relevant municipal offices to manage relationships with CSOs affects how likely administrators will establish contact and substantial coordination regarding service provision. Waste and environmental offices with weaker administrative capacity and human resource skills are overwhelmed with routine administrative tasks as shown in Chapter 4. Thus, undertaking another demanding responsibility requiring particular abilities, such as interacting with CSOs in the context of waste service provision, may be regarded as too burdensome by management teams. Second, CSO involvement is also contingent on how waste managers and local politicians perceive the capacity of these community organizations. If negatively regarded –– 194 typically due to the racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic stereotypes of their members, or about their organizational characteristics–– CSOs will be dismissed as potential partners for waste service provision. Community CSOs composed of poor individuals, indigenous peoples, or apparently weak organizations, are thus more likely considered as less capable and their involvement limited to simple waste collection services or have none at all. Third, CSOs’ organizational capacity determines both the service they engage in and the degree to which they become involved. As a result of their current organizational capacity, most community CSOs are more likely to participate in simple waste collection with minor, narrow tasks while unusually having a role in the provision of complex waste disposal due to the limited capabilities relevant for such service. CSOs with more organizational capabilities, such as a specialized structure, planning, human resources, leadership skills, and mission-orientation, are more likely to manage more waste service responsibilities and sustain them over time. Yet, these are still circumscribed to waste collection or an indirect, smaller role in waste disposal. Fourth, the complexity of the service matters for CSOs participation in service provision. More complex services that have physical and human asset specific requirements may not match the organizational capabilities of most CSOs. This is observed in CSOs involved in waste services, particularly waste disposal, who usually have a peripheral role and tend to struggle with more responsibility on this task. Therefore, an analysis of the patterns obtained from fieldwork findings shows that the provision of more complex services, such as waste disposal, unquestionably necessitates high administrative capacity for performance improvements. The complexity of this service is relatively high due to the specific set of managerial and technical capabilities needed for its provision, compared to the less highly specialized ones typically available in CSOs due to the 195 broader range of community issues they engage in to bring about development and benefits for their members. In addition, administrative capacity that is not tainted by prejudice is also essential for the effective communication and handling of CSO involvement by waste suboffices –– without these units opening the door for participation, CSOs will not have a chance to least try to build capacity to influence the performance of this complex waste service. If CSOs are to have a critical role in any waste service, especially a complex one as disposal, administrative capacity at the waste suboffice level is fundamental. 5.1 CSOs and Service Provision: Theory When and why do CSOs do service provision? Local community members tend to organize to collectively take action when government ––national or local–– is absent or fails to provide most needed goods and services (Ostrom 1990; Putnam et al. 1993). Local leaders devise different ways to ensure, in the short or long term, the access of their communities’ to basic services and livelihood opportunities (Auerbach 2017; MacLean 2010). At times, this may mean fully substituting government and directly taking responsibility under their own terms; other times, their activities may involve partially substituting (or supplementing) government to work together in specific areas where government capacity is weaker (Brass 2016; Breslin 1987; DFID 2003; Ostrom 1996; Post et al. 2017; Robinson and White 1997). This description closely resembles community CSO participation in waste collection services (Kaza et al. 2018; UN-Habitat 2010). For poor communities, there is typically too much at stake for inaction. Waiting for government to unilaterally figure out solutions to provide public services ––such as waste, water, sanitation, or electricity, for instance–– is hardly an option. Thus, communities are urged to form 196 CSOs or strengthen existing ones to work out their common problems of service provision, livelihoods, and development together. As a result, local politicians and municipal administrators ––who directly oversee most basic services–– may be forced to at least think twice before quickly dismissing their demands. However, while CSOs’ participation in service provision will likely result in some improvements for their communities, it remains unclear when and how this occurs. Looking at the case of waste disposal could help illustrate this puzzle. CSOs tend to have a minimal involvement in this service, if at all, struggling to organize their actions for a deeper role in its provision. Compared to CSOs’ experience in waste collection, the disposal case shows that research has not yet sufficiently explored the conditions under which CSOs may contribute to service performance improvements, especially when service complexity varies. What remains unclear is whether all municipalities would be open to listening and supporting any community-based CSO and, similarly, if all CSOs would successfully carry out any service task regardless of its complexity. To elucidate the role of CSOs in public services, particularly issues regarding the role of community-based CSOs in simple and complex service provision, this chapter discusses the literature to help analyze the conditions of and causal mechanisms obtained from fieldwork data. Research shows that three conditions are likely necessary for the effective involvement of civil society actors, such as community CSOs, in the provision of public services. Pertaining to CSO-government interactions, first, that local governments have the capacity to manage the relationship and, simultaneously, second, that local governments are open to work with CSOs (de la Riva Agüero 2021; Ngo et al. 2019). Third, CSOs must have some level of organizational capacity (AbouAssi et al. 2019; Andrews et al. 2010; Baggetta et al. 2013; Cammett and 197 MacLean 2014). I propose a fourth necessary condition, that in the absence of municipal capacity, services must be relatively simple for effective CSO involvement. I will explain this condition throughout the chapter. Despite the recognized challenges from civil society involvement (Grindle 2007), current studies continue to find that CSOs’ have a critical role in the provision of public services without fully considering their relationship with local governments and internal capacity, especially as services vary in complexity. 5.1.1 CSO–Government Interaction Cooperation between government and civil society, particularly CSOs, is necessary when the public sector struggles to efficiently provide services on its own (Brass 2016; Brinkerhoff and Wetterberg 2016). Weak government capacity is a common feature in the Global South, especially at the city level. This is a key reason why CSO involvement in local service provision tends to help address issues of access and responsiveness by contributing with additional organizational capacity, human resources, and legitimacy (AbouAssi and Bowman 2018; AbouAssi and Trent 2016; Arroyo and Irigoyen 2005; Brass 2012; Grindle 2007; Herrold and AbouAssi 2022; Nelson-Nuñez 2019; Remy 2004). Government capacity. Collaborations do not always lead to better service delivery performance. Municipal administrative capacity limitations may prevent the inclusion of CSOs in service provision, which at times is coupled with ineffective CSO involvement, thus affecting expected outcomes (Agranoff 2007, 157; Babiak and Thibault 2009; Brass et al. 2012; Brinkerhoff 2002; Cammett and MacLean 2011; de la Riva Agüero 2021; Jaramillo and Alcázar 2017; Loeffler and Bovaird 2016; McNulty 2019; Ngo et al. 2019; Page et al. 2015). Poor municipal planning 198 capacity and a lack of skills and experience to manage community relations may hinder municipal offices from involving CSOs, interfering with proper interaction with the communities. The benefits of collaborative relationships could also be reduced by more specific aspects of the interaction. For instance, the lack of experience on both sides with working under shared objectives, the ad hoc mechanisms entailed, and the additional coordination skills and procedures demanded especially from government may all be unforeseen hindering factors (Bovaird and Loeffler 2012; Loeffler and Bovaird 2016; Thomson and Perry 2006). Perceptions of CSOs. Similarly, at times, administrators and politicians fearful of losing power or led by discriminatory ideas can also constrain the relationship (Bovaird and Downe 2008; de la Riva Agüero 2021; Fredericks 2009, 2018). This means that the perceptions of government actors may play an essential part. Ethnic and racial diversity tends to increase the marginalization of minorities, affecting their organizational strength, especially of indigenous peoples who have experienced systemic discrimination around the world and mainly in a country like Peru (Arroyo and Irigoyen 2005; Hall and Patrinos 2012; Torero et al. 2004). Yet, in time and if CSOs are allowed to participate as equal partners, trust tends to increase, turning the relationship into a mutually dependent one (Brass 2016, 49; Brinkerhoff 2002; Cheng 2019). This evidence indicates that CSO involvement may not be as straightforward as is commonly thought. Ultimately, success in terms of service outcomes may likely depend, in part, on the degree to which government can incorporate CSOs into the service provision scheme. 199 5.1.2 CSO Capacity Community-based CSOs are formally organized civil society groups that are embedded in their communities that typically participate directly in the provision of local services as a way to support their members (Bovaird 2007; Cammett and MacLean 2014; Putnam et al. 1993). Existing research in the Global South shows that service delivery performance improves when CSOs are involved (Auerbach 2017, 2020; Cammett and MacLean 2014). These organizations hold community meetings to decide on how to participate in the provision of services such as waste management when there is less state presence locally (UN-Habitat 2010). Improvements happen when CSOs are well-organized, locally embedded, and formal (Batley 2006; Brass 2016; Cammett and MacLean 2014; Devas and Grant 2003; Putnam et al. 1993; Robinson and White 1997). However, it remains unclear if successful outcomes are as likely for complex as they are for simple ones. For instance, it is usually the case that individuals directly participating in waste service provision are from vulnerable social sectors, exposed to informal employment and discrimination, such as low-income women and their children (Fredericks 2009; Kaza et al. 2018; Vidanaarachchi et al. 2006). Their involvement, typically limited to street sweeping, waste picking, and recycling, can be trivialized by formal local government employees (Abarca-Guerrero et al. 2013; Botello-Álvarez et al. 2018; USAID 2018) and not directed to address municipal issues of provision. As a result, more complex services such as waste disposal are more likely affected, enhancing the performance gap in favor of waste collection. Locally embedded, community CSOs are crucial for advancing community interests. This is especially the case if they operate based on the decision-making and work of its members rather than of hired staff, that is, if they are internally democratic (Banks et al. 2015). 200 Fundamental issues to these communities at large would likely receive attention as a result because these CSOs would be directly mobilized by ––and thus respond to––the priorities of their members when engaging with government actors. Most needed transformations by these societal groups get addressed this way. What are the components of CSO capacity needed? To better understand the role of CSOs in service performance it is crucial to assess organizational characteristics such as structure, operations, human resources, leadership, mission orientation, strategic planning, and transparency. Focusing only on whether these organizations participate or not on service provision would thus be insufficient, and perhaps misleading. More importantly, however, not finding CSO participation in a given service, such as in a complex one like waste disposal, may actually result from internal capacity features of the organization, which in turn affect the scope of tasks they can engage in (AbouAssi et al. 2019; Hall et al. 2003). Research by AbouAssi et al. (2019) and others serves as a guide to disentangle the specific attributes of CSOs’ organizational capacity and how that may affect their activities. For instance, the structural and operational attributes of a CSO and the extent to which they are relevant to the task, complex or not, may influence the degree to which they become involved in it rather than signaling simple indifference or passivity if they do not. Likewise, when CSOs effectively participate in service provision (or not) it shows that they at least have the human capabilities to carry out a service task. In addition to the latter capability, leadership skills and commitment is crucial on its own because it allows not only better working teams but also has implications on how they negotiate their role, benefits, and compensations, as well as to navigate problems, stakeholder pressures, and unexpected demands from administrators (Andrews et al. 2010; Baggetta et al. 2013; Han et al. 2011). Leadership thus has wider 201 organizational consequences. What motivates their involvement is also essential, especially if they are mission-oriented organizations led by a commitment to support in collective development and wellbeing, especially for their communities (Brass 2016, 48; Putnam et al. 1993), in contrast to those led by short-term, individualistic goals. To accomplish their missions, CSOs with greater capacity may draft strategic plans that provide a blueprint on the internal resources available, carefully considering when and how these resources will be matched with service tasks they have committed to participate in (AbouAssi et al. 2019). Finally, transparency with the communities they represent and with government is another important characteristic of capacity (Devas and Grant 2003; Putnam et al. 1993). Relations based on clientelism and patronage negatively affect service performance (Batley et al. 2012; Grindle 2007, 2012; Nelson 2007). This feature may also be related to the formality of the organization. Over time, and with more participation, transparent CSO management tends to build trust, collaboration, social support networks, and more effective pressure on public authorities. Fundamentally, CSOs with all such capacity features help improve government responsiveness that may produce better service performance, even in non-democratic political regimes (Putnam et al. 1993; Putnam et al. 1988; Putnam et al. 1983; Tsai 2007). Overall, CSO participation in service provision may thus depend on the organizational capacity and embeddedness of the group. Better managed, collaborative community CSOs that have close, constructive relationships with the local government may more likely help improve service performance. However, if more capacity exists for simple services, meaning they are more focused on this type of services, then their influence on service performance may likely reduce for more complex ones because they may likely lack the specialization needed for such services. While this is a matter of CSO capacity, it also has to do with the complexity of the 202 service itself regardless of capacity, embeddedness, or partnership with the local government. Municipal capacity to adequately manage CSO involvement across different services, such as in the case of waste collection and disposal, is nonetheless essential. Upon examination of these theories and the quantitative findings discussed in Chapter 3, certain limitations are revealed for learning about what is truly leading CSOs to have positive outcomes on waste collection but none on waste disposal. With the purpose of uncovering the conditions and some causal mechanisms and finding additional insights, this chapter provides some answers the following overarching question: Under what conditions does community-based CSO involvement affect the performance of simple services but not of more complex services? This question is approached through an exploration of two more specific questions: How does CSOs’ relationship with the municipality affect the provision of simple and complex services? What CSO organizational capacity characteristics affect their successful participation in the service provision process, leading to improved performance in collection but not in disposal? The next section unravels the causal processes by looking at CSOs’ relationship with local governments and their organizational capacity in more detail, using fieldwork qualitative data from CSOs in the three Peruvian municipal case studies. The final section concludes. 5.2 CSOs and Waste Services Performance Differences: Conditions and Causal Mechanisms Community CSOs in Peru, such as neighborhood associations, indigenous communities, poverty alleviation CSOs, and recyclers associations usually face significant organizational weaknesses (Arroyo and Irigoyen 2005; Bland and Chirinos 2014; Calzada et al. 2017; De Silva et al. 2007; Remy 2004, 130-131). They tend to struggle to maintain a cohesive group and 203 engaged membership; internally structure teams and allocate specific tasks; accurately identify and prioritize problems they can address in light of available capabilities; devise actionable plans and strategies to achieve their goals, and; transparently make collective decisions (Interviews 31, 66, and 69). These problems limit their capacity to address community needs effectively. However, a closer look at the case of waste management shows not only how CSOs participate in services but, perhaps most importantly, their varied organizational attributes. This is observed through their involvement in waste collection and disposal, revealing their strengths and challenges, hence helping explain waste service performance outcomes. Although CSO weakness can be a core difficulty, these actors also have to deal with equally struggling municipal offices lacking capacity as well as local authorities that regard them as negligible actors due to their socioeconomic and ethnic characteristics. Municipal offices and authorities can hence facilitate or complicate CSOs’ participation in waste service provision. This is important because CSOs’ role in service performance, while mainly contingent on their capacity, may also result from whether management has the skill to handle the relationship and if decision-makers perceive them as worthy partners to solve local service problems as those pertaining waste. While this may be true in many cases, there are municipal actors in Peru that appreciate CSOs’ capabilities and contributions to service provision and that have some capacity to manage their participation, such as in waste collection in Sicuani. Similarly, there are CSOs that have strong organizational capacity, including leadership skills for negotiation, and are thus delivering benefits for their communities through their involvement in service provision, such as in waste disposal in Satipo. However, municipal capacity, positive perceptions, and CSO capacity also vary depending on a fourth factor: service complexity. For instance, for simple waste collection 204 in Sicuani, strong CSOs interact with a municipal Waste Suboffice with some specialized capacity and recognition of CSOs’ role. For complex waste disposal, however, all three conditions are low. The high physical and human asset specificity of disposal presents management problems to waste suboffices with overwhelmed personnel and low administrative specialization, limiting CSO engagement as observed in Bagua Grande and Sicuani. If CSO involvement occurs, however, weak suboffice capacity or prejudiced perceptions of CSOs, or both, reduce the likelihood that the municipality will fulfill any commitments agreed upon with CSOs in return for their service support. The three case studies demonstrate the conditions in which CSOs can support improvements in the performance of simple waste collection while struggling to produce the same result for complex waste disposal. First, suboptimal waste office capacity to manage CSO involvement leads to ineffective CSO involvement in collection, unless committed individual top leadership within the office takes charge of making it work. Similarly, if municipal capacity is weak, strong CSOs can help improve simple collection performance. In the case of disposal, suboptimal office capacity ––or committed individual leadership in compensation–– is insufficient to produce adequate performance even in the presence of strong CSO capacity. This indicates that high municipal office capacity is crucial for CSO involvement and impact on complex disposal. Second, positive, unbiased perceptions of CSO capacity and their members is necessary for CSO’s to influence the performance of both collection and disposal. The main role of the perceptions of municipal workers, however, is of allowing CSOs to have a chance to become involved that, in turn, gives them the opportunity to learn about the service and develop the capacity needed. If perceptions are negative, they will have a marginal role or none at all. Third, CSOs can have suboptimal capacity but still have a crucial influence in waste collection 205 performance. CSOs with a similarly low capacity would have a minor or negligible role in waste disposal performance. This means that some CSO capacity is sufficient to help improve simple collection, but that high CSO capacity is necessary to help in complex disposal. Finally, the role of CSOs in waste service performance is contingent on service complexity. 5.2.1 CSO–Municipality Relationship CSO participation in waste services is contingent on the type of relationship they have with municipal actors, both administrative and political. One part is explain by how CSOs and their members are perceived by these government actors, affecting the degree to which their involvement is encouraged or hindered. Another part is about the capacity of the municipal office to handle the relationship with CSOs. It is true that some CSOs have low organizational capacity. However, they can still add value to waste service performance with proper municipal capacity to engage and support them in the process as their own capacity is developed. Collaborations can range from ––intentional or unintentional–– utter disregard of their existence, skeptical or lukewarm interest, to genuine support and recognition of their contributions. Table 5.2 summarizes CSO–municipal relations by waste service and case study. 206 Table 5.2.

Notes: Category classifications are: none, poor, moderate, and high. The category on “perceptions of CSO characteristics” refers to those from municipal workers and the classifications are: negative, moderate, positive, and indifferent. The indifferent classification means that the category was not expressed as relevant. a) Municipal weakness and perceptions about CSO capacity affect interactions. CSOs receive these different treatments from local officials. When their capacity is not fully acknowledged, some municipal actors justify this from not having enough budget to reward their participation, in-kind or in-cash. Others consider them passive organizations or that have problematic leadership. A few others are not explicit but make no tangible effort to engage them 207 in provision. When valued, however, their diligence in planning, operational capacity, or leadership transparency are praised. Encouraging their involvement is ultimately a matter of decision. Budgets are evidently not infinite, and many local governments do confront multiple difficulties, but how they are allocated responds to political and managerial priorities. Thus, the varied rationales to leave them aside even though waste service provision struggles signals at least two conditions. First, some managers and politicians have disparaging views about CSOs. Socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic discrimination is implicit, perceivable only by subtle expressions and decisions. Second, other times, however, CSOs are not included because the waste suboffices are simply administratively overwhelmed. All this tends to result in a typically narrower participation that is confined to basic tasks associated with a simpler service, such as waste collection. These causal mechanisms are discussed in more detail in the lines that follow. Since issue of municipal administrative capacity are discussed in Chapter 4 in detail, this section concentrates on the first point which is the perceptions of local authorities. Bagua Grande. Two types of community organizations interact with the municipality in Bagua Grande, mothers and recyclers. In both cases, interactions are limited. From the Waste Suboffice point of view, these CSOs are weak, ineffective organizations composed of poor, unskilled individuals that can hardly contribute to service provision. This means that the Suboffice is not interested in collaborating with them. The degree to which they interact with the local government is thus limited, for both the mothers’ clubs and the recyclers’ association. The Waste Suboffice and other municipal authorities end up ignoring them as a result. 208 An indication of this is that, while coordinating fieldwork logistics, the Waste Suboffice could not find any information on community CSOs participating in waste. Some interviewees claim that their participation stopped with the pandemic 15 months ago from the time this fieldwork was conducted. Yet, the municipality had no documentation, registry, or contact information of the CSOs they worked with (Ethno-BG-6). After insisting with several contacts, the only available information was provided by a top manager of the Environmental Office in a hand-written note sent via WhatsApp. It turned out that this piece of paper contained inaccurate information on the CSOs and their leaders –– it was not only outdated, but the contact details were not of organizations that had participated in waste services (Figure 5.6). “We no longer have contact, my friend,” said the manager 30 minutes later after sending the note and realizing the error (Ethno-BG-6). Figure 5.6. Contact Information of CSOs Provided by the Bagua Grande Environmental Office Source: WhatsApp picture sent by top manager to the author. 209 Twenty mothers’ clubs had participated in waste collection in the past, before the pandemic. Even though they have played an important role in sweeping the streets no one has remained in contact with these local leaders. There is not even a directory with the name and cellular phone of at least their presidents. This has a three-way explanation. First, their weak organizational capacity ––in terms of skilled leadership, strategic planning, and dedicated membership–– has diverted them from developing a systematic relationship with the Waste Suboffice so that they could have a role in waste service provision. This means these CSOs do give the impression of poor commitment and capability to handle collective tasks. Second, poor capacity in the Waste Suboffice to elaborate detailed plans to address waste problems and thus identify ways in which community CSOs could help. Third, implicit prejudice against CSOs based on their members’ individual characteristics, such as their race and socioeconomic conditions, is held by local authorities. The assumption is that because they are poor and need social support to make ends meet, if at all, they are less committed or capable of carrying out tasks and following orders efficiently. This is the view of top managers from the Environmental Office, other municipal offices, and local political authorities, implicit or otherwise. Poor administrative capacity and prejudice are critical limitations for CSO participation. After all, CSOs can develop capacity if given the chance, especially when there is municipal need of working hands to provide struggling services. Waste service conditions show the urgency. For instance, not all neighborhoods in Bagua Grande receive the same level of collection service quality (SSO-COLL-BG-1_1, SSO-COLL-BG-2_1, SSO-COLL-BG-3_1, SSO-COLL-BG-4_1). The dump forms large mounds of waste every few hours, including hospital waste, with animals feeding from all of it (SSO-DISP-BG-1, SSO-DISP-BG-8, Ethno-BG-5). If there are community organizations with numerous members needing social support and 210 services urgently demanding labor, the next step is for managers to draft a plan to make this work. At least some portion of these two services could potentially benefit from less expensive and temporary manual labor. Yet, none of this currently occurs. Even if the budget for waste services were limited, some type of agreement could be reached with these CSOs and their members –– they are financially urged by the pandemics’ employment consequences. Some in-kind or cash compensation in exchange of their work time could suffice for most of them and, in fact, they are waiting for this. But nothing emerges from the municipality –– the Waste Suboffice operates as usual with no new measures to solve its blatant service problems. A community leader with insider information from the Environmental Office and political authorities explained: “There is a wrong perception in the [Environmental] Office about CSOs. If they were called it would be a great incentive, they would support … It is not done out of pessimism, because management thinks that there is no interest in the population,” this person explained (Int-BG-26). A manager from said office confirmed the negative view of CSOs: “[m]y opinion about local CSOs is that there is no interest in environmental issues … There is little participation of CSOs ...” (Int-BG-30). This perspective indicates that CSOs need to reach out to the municipality, not vice versa, denoting a top-down view of CSOs by management and a lack of interest on working with them. Politicians share the same thought and prejudice. A councilmember who is part of the council’s environmental commission explained that CSOs are not involved in waste services “due to their socioeconomic situation … [which is] an indication of ignoring these processes … they do not have the necessary knowledge … [and] are quite ignorant” (Int-BG-19). Another top politician shared the same view, adding that “the problem is capacity building … They have a lot 211 of problems, they fight [each other] … The idiosyncrasy [is not good]” (Int-BG-31). Knowledge of the service is necessary depending on the specific role. Yet, the politicians generalized them as incompetent for being poor. In fact, not much preparation is required for waste picking or accommodating waste at the dump, but even then, many waste-related task can be learned on the job as shown in Satipo and Sicuani. These politicians were also confused about CSOs broadly, showing they are disengaged from community organizations in the city. Thus, CSOs in Bagua Grande are marginalized and are even less likely to approach the municipality and the Suboffice for any collaboration. There is not distinction between CSOs in waste collection or disposal. Their main challenge is the meager support from the municipality. “We had to demand the municipality, the manager, and the cleaning supervisor,” said a leader referring to their waste picking tasks as CSOs (Int-BG-24). They have never had a meeting with the environmental manager and feel abandoned (Int-BG-8, Int-BG-29). Trust and communication are low on both sides, minimizing their involvement in both waste services. Yet, this situation is more the product of low Suboffice capacity and the biased, presumably discriminatory perceptions that administrative and political leaders have about CSOs. If the CSOs were supported, they would strongly commit and make important contributions to waste services. Collection and disposal performance are equally reduced from misperceptions and biases. Sicuani. CSOs in Sicuani have two types of relationships with the Waste Suboffice: one friendly and supportive, for collection, and; another, tense, marked by discontent, for disposal. Two community kitchens manage the waste collection service and, over three decades, they have developed a solid rapport with the Suboffice for its provision. The Waste Suboffice is not 212 administratively strong and does not have a Governance Suboffice, as in Satipo. Despite municipal capacity issues, they developed a strong collaborative association. “Everything is coordinated [with the Suboffice] … We interact weekly, every other day … there is a deep cooperation,” said a leader (Int-SI-12). “They call us to manage problems and solutions. Always,” stressed another (Int-SI-11). Local politicians also generally approve of their work. Yet, a few detractors in the municipality believe the service would be more cost-effectively provided if more compactor trucks and street sweeping vehicles were purchased in their stead. There is also an implicit disparaging sentiment that these CSOs receive poverty assistance, despite the cleanliness of the streets from their effort (Int-SI-4, Int-SI-6). However, trust and communication flourish, and the partnership only becomes more solid over time because of the committed support they receive from a tenured top Environmental Office manager. The positive outlook of this CSO before municipal authorities is produced by the highly efficient way they provide the collection service. On the other hand, the indigenous community who generously conceded a portion of their lands to be used as a disposal site has a complicated partnership with the Suboffice and the political authorities. The municipality has failed to meet its part of the agreement. It did not improve the community’s roads and other infrastructural facilities. Furthermore, rather than implementing protective environmental measures for air, land, and water sustainability they converted the area into a mismanaged ––at times unmanaged–– informal open dump. “The land was given for a landfill, not a dump. The municipality has not kept its part … The agreement says that they would do one infrastructure project per year, but nothing … There is no relationship,” indicated an upset leader of the community (Int-SI-26). 213 To fulfill a small part of the agreement, the Suboffice has hired 15 community members to work at the dump and composting area. While this municipal failure is true, administrators and politicians believe community leaders exaggerate and are problematic. “There is manipulation [from the community]. ‘If you don't give me this, I’ll close the dump’ … they play with this. It is a lasting conflict and must be handled carefully, if they want A we must give them A,” expressed a Waste Suboffice manager (Int-SI-6). No serious effort is made on either part to address their differences and build a new productive, collaborative relationship. More importantly, municipal actors have acted upon negative perceptions about this CSO, avoiding alternative solutions to the conflict. If they were not a CSO of poor indigenous peoples, the agreement would likely not be so blatantly trampled over. The core concern of the CSO is to protect its lands and receive community investment, all which are part of the agreement, but the municipality has fully ignored its responsibility for both the agreement and the disposal service. Distrust only continues to grow from mutually negative perceptions, partly influencing the degree to which waste disposal is properly provided. Therefore, these differences in CSO–municipality relationships help increase the performance gap between the two waste services. The beneficial collaboration context for collection alongside an association mired in conflict for disposal is another mechanism explaining the performance gaps. Satipo. CSOs in Satipo are entrepreneurial. They are neighborhood associations that organize their communities and reach out to the Waste and Governance suboffices for support. They are pressured to act because most are in the city’s periphery and have unpaved roads. These CSOs are not too far from the center but enough to periodically receive a different treatment from the 214 waste collection routines, that in Satipo are closely tied to disposal services due to the municipal policy on waste sorting. This means that if access is unpaved and the area is considered outside the city center, the Suboffice makes decisions on when and what to collect. Disposal services are thus made worse when all waste bags are mixed in the truck, without sorting into organics, recyclables, and disposables. The Waste Suboffice is administratively strong, but has some capacity issues to sufficiently reach these neighborhoods because “[t]here are not enough staff to fulfill everything planned” (Int-SA-3). “[T]he problem is giving them the service,” added a manager. “It is difficult to promise something that cannot be fulfilled by the logistics of [the] collection service” (Int-SA-4). Resource limitations affect coverage of routes that are in the periphery (routes 3 and 4). Nonetheless, the municipality has performed exceedingly well in the provision of both waste services, including involving CSOs in the provision process. These communities recognize the municipality’s effort even in peripheral areas. “They do call us to meetings [on waste collection and sorting] and ask us to talk to our neighbors. It is two times a year,” a leader explained (Int-SA-26). They were asked by the Governance Suboffice to work together with them on waste sorting tasks ––properly separating waste and taking it outside during the scheduled times–– and to engage their entire communities for this to be successful. They received training from the municipality on how to do this. (Int-SA-30). Similarly, the community next to the disposal facility, despite some serious conflicts in the past, also recognized the effort made by the municipality to work collaboratively with them and attempting to fulfill the formal agreement they had reached together (Int-SA-15). The Waste and Governance suboffices in Satipo thus coordinate well with CSOs, for both collection and disposal. 215 Despite these efforts, there has been a recent decline in their interactions and service provision in these communities that is affecting CSOs’ trust levels toward the local government (Int-SA-28, Int-SA-30). Unlike Bagua Grande, administrators in Satipo’s waste-related suboffices do recognize their logistical limitations to reach certain communities. Discrimination against CSOs in the latter is not an explicit reason to provide less services to CSOs. Some experienced local politicians, however, believe that CSOs in the city are passive organizations without leadership that need to be propped up to act in their own interests, revealing a distant, patronizing approach about community CSOs (Int-SA-33, Int-SA-35). Yet, when waste service resources need prioritizing, the first affected are poor communities in the city’s periphery. The higher relative costs to provide waste services a few extra minutes away from the center could be a way to cut some budget expenses on gas and vehicle maintenance. Implicit socioeconomic discrimination in these decision-making processes cannot be fully discarded. The communities and the Waste and Governance suboffices work hard to keep good communications and working relations with each other –– after all, the former seeks better services for their communities and the latter has waste collection and disposal as top service priorities. Therefore, while the interaction may be somewhat strained due to current events, such as the pandemic context, they are both striving to establish a close interaction to ensure that performance is high in both waste services. Despite some challenges in waste collection and disposal performance, possibly by biased decisions against poor CSOs, the local government is responsive and painstakingly trying to address these problems. Conditions and Mechanisms. CSO–municipal relations are critical to the involvement of these organizations in waste service provision, either facilitating or hindering their participation. 216 Without the support of the relevant waste-related offices, community CSOs can hardly have a role in either simple collection or complex disposal. While the administrative capacity of the municipal office is crucial for the handling of the relationship, as shown in Chapter 4, the perceptions of local authorities about the CSOs and their members are equally determinant. Overwhelmed administrators with limited skills, resources, and leadership can hardly devise ways of integrating CSOs in service provision. The contrary occurs if personnel have the skills, resources, and organizational structure to support collaborations, such as in Satipo. Similarly, if CSOs are regarded as strong organizations, it is more likely that they will be called to support in the service provision efforts. If their organizational capacity is viewed as weak then they will less probably be invited. However, regardless of capacity, the cases show that local authorities’ prejudice about their members based on racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic conditions also partly affect the degree to which CSOs are allowed to participate. Given the more complex requirements of some services, such as waste disposal, involvement is more likely allowed in more simple services like collection –– this partly results from local authorities’ perceptions of the capacity of CSOs and their members. 5.2.2 CSO Organizational Capacity The community CSOs studied have varied organizational features (AbouAssi et al. 2019). Interviews and ethnographic observations were held with poverty-alleviation CSOs, neighborhood associations, indigenous communities, and recyclers’ associations all of which participate in some form in waste service provision. There are common organizational traits among those successfully ––or unsuccessfully–– participating in the provision of waste collection and disposal services. 217 Most CSOs have some basic organizational capacity for a favorable involvement in collection, ranging from human capabilities to contribute with manual labor to operational and planning capabilities to manage the entire service. Thus, it is more likely to see them as part of the provision of this simple waste service. However, it is rather unusual to find CSOs with a defined organizational structure, procedures, or members concentrated on supporting waste disposal activities. While some do help organize their communities in the waste sorting stage of disposal, and others select members to work at the disposal site managed by the municipality, their involvement tends to be superficial in this complex waste service. Thus, CSO participation in waste collection tends to help improve its performance but does not influence waste disposal performance significantly. Their organizational capacity fits better with the less physical and human asset specific requirements of collection. Yet, their capabilities are not specialized enough for a more involved role in disposal. This means that capacity features such as a loosely organized internal structure, missions, operational capacity, leadership skills, and strategic planning ––even if weak–– are sufficient for an important participation in collection but not in disposal. Table 5.3 summarizes these CSO characteristics by municipal case study. 218 Table 5.3. CSO organizational capacity Categories Bagua Grande Sicuani Satipo Collection Mission Orientation Individualistic, short-term view Collective, long-term view Collective, long-term view Structure (internal specialization) None High Moderate Operations Poor High Moderate Human Resources Moderate High High Strategic Planning None High Moderate Transparency High High High Leadership (skills and commitment) Poor High High Disposal Mission Orientation Individualistic, short-term view Collective, short-term Collective, long-term view Structure (internal specialization) Poor High Moderate Operations Poor Poor Moderate Human Resources Poor Poor High Strategic Planning Poor Poor Moderate Transparency High High High Leadership (skills and commitment) Poor Poor High Sources: Fieldwork. Notes: Category classifications are: none, poor, moderate, and high. For mission orientation, the classifications are: individualistic vs. collective and short- vs. long-term view. a) Developmental, mission-oriented organizing strengthens waste service involvement, but mainly for collection. CSOs’ organizational missions influence whether and how they participate in service provision. The CSOs involved in waste services in the three case studies are focused on finding ways to support the livelihoods and wellbeing of their communities. Their creation is based on a shared community with members typically living in the same or proximate neighborhoods. Yet, their association as CSOs is generally motivated by a need to address their members’ poverty and scarce and many times exploitative employment opportunities. The situation of these communities paired with the service provision challenges faced by municipal waste suboffices generated openings for these CSOs to support waste services. In return, they would receive some form of compensation, in cash or in kind, that would help them cope with 219 household poverty or community service access problems. Despite the common challenges, these CSOs have different missions and views about themselves that have motivated varying forms and levels of participation in waste collection and disposal. Bagua Grande. Access to food and jobs is what drives CSOs in Bagua Grande. Interviewees recognized that they were created as a strategy to find collective solutions to difficulties finding employment and stable incomes among community members (Int-BG-8, Int-BG-28, Int-BG-29). These CSOs are mothers’ clubs and nutrition organizations led by women and a recyclers’ association with mixed gender membership. “Most of us are single mothers, we work for our children … Other supports that we give as a club are for sick mothers” explained a leader (Int-BG-24). Most CSOs were created to do street sweeping, with the mission of looking “for work and food, due to … poverty and lack of work for poor mothers” (Int-BG-29). Their core driver to organize is their members’ livelihood struggles. “We do not get jobs because we do not meet the [training] requirements,” said a leader (Int-BG-8). Women-led CSOs used to conduct street sweeping activities in exchange of some essential groceries, such as rice, oil and sugar. They stopped working with the municipality right before the pandemic started, in April 2020, due to a municipal decision out of precaution and budget limitations that reduced social support (Int-BG-5, Int-BG-24). Thus, community organizing in Bagua Grande and participation in waste services –– whether via waste picking or the gathering of recyclables for sale–– are essentially collective survival strategies, and possibly one of last resort. Given the poverty issues that motivate their existence, and their members struggle to make a living, their organizational capacity takes a 220 second place. Thus, CSO participation in waste collection is weak or entirely absent. For disposal, systematic and effective involvement is not feasible given that their mission is to find immediate livelihood solutions. Minimal organizational capacity is contrary and insufficient for the requirements of a complex waste service. Sicuani. The material poverty condition of CSO members in Sicuani is a central feature motivating their actions. Two large women-led community kitchens, with 600 and 250 members each, conduct all waste collection services. For waste disposal, an indigenous community of roughly 5,000 members has temporarily lent a portion of their lands to the municipality. Their members are also connected by shared indigenous ethnic identities and norms. The community kitchens’ members are all females. Their vulnerability is coupled by the fact that they are the sole providers for their children. Most members are single mothers or widows. “We are poor –– women, single mothers, abandoned mothers with several children, widows. [Our organization] was created to support each other and that’s why we work,” said a leader (Int-SI-11). Both CSOs were simultaneously created 31 years ago during a time of severe economic collapse in Peru to collectively help each other. “There was a crisis of poverty … in 1990. That’s how the community kitchens were created, to watch over the nutrition of women from marginal neighborhoods. Then an agreement was made with the municipality for cleaning,” explained another leader (Int-SI-12). Members of the CSO involved in disposal are connected by family, ethnic ties. Their original reason of existence is to preserve their indigenous community. “Our task is to represent all community members … [and] solve all kinds of problems … like the dump,” clarified a group of leaders (Int-SI-26). As with other CSOs, their difficult economic situation is a factor 221 motivating their organized action in waste services. “The whole community is in need. Our little piece of land, and its production, is for the family, to survive” (Int-SI-26). This is why they requested that the agreement with the municipality included the hiring of some members in waste disposal. Poverty is a driving factor leading to the formation of the CSOs involved in waste services in Sicuani. However, their shared experiences and cultural norms from their similar indigenous ethnic backgrounds, coupled with their common household vulnerabilities, also strongly motivate their organized action. While these are strong reasons for the two women’s CSOs to lead waste collection services completely and efficiently, they are not enough to carry out waste disposal services. Similarly, although the dump is in the property of the indigenous community CSO, they have not been successful at enforcing the agreement with the municipality. Their participation does not go beyond selecting 15 community members to work for the municipality at the dump and the makeshift composting facility. Although they could have been more involved, either in the provision of this service or by more thoroughly supervising the municipality’s work to make sure their lands are adequately protected, they are not. Therefore, this illustrates that a collectively oriented, developmental mission ––and the resulting committed membership–– is not sufficient on its own to engage in the provision of a more complex service directly and successfully. Satipo. Community CSOs in Satipo are mostly neighborhood associations and some indigenous communities. Both have similar responsibilities. Unlike in Bagua Grande, their existence is fundamentally motivated by the urge to improve the living conditions and access to services for their communities. Their collective improvements are seen as in support of their livelihoods. 222 To improve wellbeing in the community, and expecting municipal support, these CSOs are typically involved in sorting waste into organics, reusables, and non-reusables and making sure waste bags are left outside their members’ homes following the correct schedules provided by the Waste Suboffice. Waste sorting contributes to collection services, but also has larger implications (and, in fact, is part of the strategy) for waste disposal. Sorting helps reduce the waste load, leachate, and methane generation in the landfill, while also increasing the production of sustainable byproducts such as compost and items made of recycled materials. This means that their involvement driven by their developmental mission benefits both collection and disposal, though indirectly. One CSO, also motivated by community wellbeing, makes periodical, forceful demands to the municipality to solve issues of strong smells ––from leachate treatment problems. They have a direct involvement with the disposal facility because it is located right next to their community. Their collective concerns lead them to constantly push the Waste Suboffice and its Landfill Management subunit to find more effective solutions. CSOs in Satipo consistently highlight that their mission is to ensure their communities’ wellbeing and promote development. “My greatest desire is to create another production unit, like a fish farm, small animals … All this is my main function, that the community becomes self-sustaining,” explained a leader (Int-SA-15). Another CSO head mentioned that they work “to bring well-being … so that [the community] lives comfortably, that is the objective” (Int-SA-26). “The mission of the community is to maintain our culture … [We want to help] [e]veryone progress mentally,” said a leader from a different CSO (Int-SA-28). 223 To exemplify their mission of community development, one leader described their improvements during their 14 years of existence, although there are basic services that are still unprovided: [W]e had no water at home, only one source for the entire neighborhood. Today we have [in-house water supply]. The green areas were a ditch, a hole, [and] today [they are] covered for children to play. We didn't have light, today we do. But there is no drainage (Int-SA-30). Although they face important challenges, these CSOs’ are driven not exclusively by securing short-term employment or food assistance but, primarily, by a longer-term view. Their missions are concentrated on the improvement of their communities’ and the lives of their members. Their members still struggle to make ends meet and need to diversify their sources of income ––through a combination of temporary and term jobs. Yet, they are collectively mobilized by a wider temporal vision. This means that livelihood problems are addressed collectively in this municipality. Such organizational perspective leads them to look beyond immediate subsistence. In that regard, while their participation in waste disposal is not in depth in the sense of delivering or leading important parts of the service, they do engage in its early, crucial stages and also on forcing the Suboffice to adequately manage it. The high administrative capacity of Satipo’s Waste Suboffice to provide waste disposal services may also reduce the space for these CSOs involvement. Conditions and Mechanisms. Organizational missions generally define the path that CSOs will take when participating in service provision. If driven by members’ individual livelihood problems, then the CSO will likely take any opportunity that appears in the short-term, such as 224 engaging in sporadic waste collection activities with the local government. If that does not work out or stops, they will move on, individually, because their members will need to find other work opportunities that emerge to solve their urgent household income issues. The organization is thus used as a temporary life-saving vehicle. Because little time is available to strengthen it, it is weakened and cannot develop sufficient capacity to engage in service provision more systematically. Thus, the municipality loses sight of them. When CSOs’ missions are more collectively driven, that is to promote community development and wellbeing, they tend to invest more effort in strengthening their organization so they can bring about benefits for all. That is how they are more likely to have a sustained relationship with the municipality, especially if the service is simple such as waste collection. However, while mission orientation is necessary for organizational capacity and service participation, mainly for simple services, it is not sufficient for more complex ones such as waste disposal. That is possibly why CSOs in Satipo and Sicuani are peripherally engaged in waste disposal despite their mission to improve wellbeing in their communities. b) Structural specialization, strategic planning, and operational capacity help waste collection, minor disposal contributions. All CSOs interviewed have an internal structure composed of a president, vice-president, treasurer, secretary, communications person, and auditor. They form the board of directors running a CSO and are elected by members for periods of one to two years. Similarly, decision-making on key topics is done openly with all members and based on vote count. Most of them became formal CSOs with their own groups’ means, without external support. Yet, having this structure, open, participatory decision-making, and 225 formality are not sufficient to determine a CSO’s impact on waste collection or disposal performance. Other capacity features are also key for an effective role in waste collection. For instance, some organizations have some level of task organization and objectives, typically part of strategic planning, to conduct waste collection activities. These characteristics generate committed membership because they contribute to organizational credibility. This type of capacity also allows CSOs to implement strategies that contribute toward the improvement of waste collection services. On the other hand, the case studies illustrate that when these organizational features are absent, CSOs struggle to devise ways to become involved and address community concerns, even in waste collection. The ability of a CSO to convince the municipality to support their participation is thus hindered as is their capacity to collaborate with other local CSOs to jointly address livelihood and service issues. Members lose hope on the organization and its problem-solving capability, reducing participation. The difficulty to gather support for their actions, like summoning waste collection teams, is also affected. However, while the case studies show that some CSOs have a role in waste disposal services, these are minor or specific contributions. Even the CSOs with more capacity in municipalities seriously struggling with disposal do not have an active, in-depth participation in its provision. Although other factors may limit CSO involvement in waste disposal, such as managerial capacity in waste suboffices to handle CSO involvement, organizational capacity issues also reveal that CSOs’ internal capabilities may be necessary but not sufficient to engage in the provision of a complex service more fully. Partly due to these organizational capacity features, CSOs struggle to participate in complex waste disposal. 226 Bagua Grande. CSOs have established leadership positions in their boards. Given how they have defined their organizational missions, however, their capabilities are circumscribed to manage a narrow set of occasional activities focused on basic livelihood assistance to their members when sick or financially struggling. CSOs do not have subcommittees working on strategic planning for fundraising or targeted activities (Int-BG-8, Int-BG-24, Int-BG-29). Board members do everything, informally delegating some tasks to non-board members that can occasionally volunteer (Int-BG-28). Mothers’ clubs goals’ are not part of a strategic plan or backed by well-structured teams and operations. These goals are carried out through small, infrequent fundraisers between them and their relatives. Through neighborhood barbecues, they ask members for donations upon need. Gift baskets, cash, or in-kind contributions are made for members needing support. “When we have activities, we charge one [Peruvian] Sol [or about USD 0.2635],” described a leader (Int-BG-29). They also have operational obstacles even to organize these events. “We don’t have our own space [as a CSO], we meet at my house or on the sidewalk,” added another one (Int-BG-24). Their activities are conducted with difficulty, showing limited planning and operational capacity. The help provided to members can be insufficient due to low membership numbers, commitment, and resources available. These issues critically limit their operational capacity. Membership commitment and low identification with their organizations is also a contributing factor to operational limitations (Int-BG-28). They are more focused on their individual livelihoods. Some members also join other social support CSOs to further minimize household 35 The exchange rate used in this chapter is the nominal annual average for 2021, which is when the interview took place, at 3.88 Peruvian Soles per US dollar as reported by the Peruvian Central Bank. The data was obtained from: https://estadisticas.bcrp.gob.pe/estadisticas/series/anuales/resultados/PM05242PA/html/2015/2022/. 227 vulnerabilities. Even leaders have abandoned their positions without notice: “[t]he initial president left us for a job in Chiclayo [a main city a few hours away], and never came back. She left to work in asparagus” (Int-BG-29). Commitment to the organization itself has a secondary place. With a poor internal structure, strategic planning, and membership commitment, they struggle to conduct most activities. The recyclers’ association confronts similar problems, but has relatively more clear tasks that have some contribution for disposal. Its core organizational activities are the crushing, sorting, and packing of plastic and cardboards (Ethno-BG-3). Their members also go in small teams of two or three to the dump to collect more recyclables, but what is collected there is for their individual use and sale (Ethno-BG-5). While this action may help reduce waste pressure at the dump, their contribution is minimal because of its very small scale. As a result of negotiations, the municipality collects some recyclables each week and stores them in a large municipal vehicle parking lot so that CSO members work on sorting. It is not much, however. A team of eight out of the 18 members work there each Monday to prepare all materials for sale once every month or month and a half in the closest major city. As a result of this collective hard work, nonetheless, their profits are also insufficient. Every one to one and a half months, they obtain “1,100 Soles [USD 284], which is divided by 18 [members]. That comes to 70-80 Soles [USD 18-21] per person” (Int-BG-8). The revenue made is largely insufficient to sustain an individual or family, further showing their weak strategic planning as a CSO ––with a small business side–– with micro-scale contributions to waste disposal. Similarly, their work is carried out with much improvisation and operational issues. For instance, a municipal motor tricycle driver manually unloads collected recyclable waste in the lot. Cardboards are thrown in front of the storage area assigned to the 228 CSO and plastics are manually placed in bags by CSO members. Nonrecyclables are hence not sifted and end up packed together with recyclable items (SSO-RECYC-BG-2, SSO-RECYC-BG-3). Given the unspecialized structure, lack of planning, and member commitment challenges for both collection and disposal, CSOs in Bagua Grande are unable to make major performance contributions to the two waste services. Sicuani. CSOs in Sicuani have a highly specialized internal structure and capacity for waste service provision. The boards are exceedingly diligent, participatory, and thoughtful in the planning of strategies and allocation of work to members. Job opportunities are provided to those with larger household responsibilities and vulnerabilities; a hard task in communities facing widespread poverty. Dedicated and experienced teams conduct the waste service-related activities –– if new members are selected to participate, they receive guidance and training by more skilled peers. Membership commitment is thus strong –– they trust that their boards work in the benefit of all. Compared to Bagua Grande and Satipo, these CSOs, and especially the two waste collection CSOs, are stronger and more impactful organizations in waste services. The two community kitchens conduct the waste collection service in its entirety. They are strong, all-women-led organizations conducting this service for 31 years. The Waste Suboffice barely gets involved –– mainly solving problems when the trucks brake, but even then, board members take charge. Waste administrators conduct minimal oversight of the CSOs’ work. Both are umbrella CSOs, with one representing 15 smaller community kitchens and the other 29. The former works in the left margin of the city and the latter in the right margin. 229 Their organizational capacity is admirable. Internally, they have subunits and teams planning and setting up different collection-related tasks to implement the operation. Their boards take care of all managerial details for their operations. They gather the paperwork for the monthly contract and payment of their members working on street sweeping, 36 from the left margin CSO and 60 from the right margin CSO (Int-SI-4, Int-SI-11, Int-SI-12). The board also coordinates the maintenance and purchase of equipment such as tricycles, brooms, bolts, tires. They supervise routes and find replacements when someone gets sick, among other tasks. “[We] [w]atch over everything that belongs to the organization –– see things that happen with the compactor truck, the tricycles that break down, and find solutions. There are always things that happen,” said one CSO leader (Int-SI-11). Their operational capacity for waste collection is strong and highly intricate. It responds to thorough planning, aiming to high service performance. Each CSO has four rotating field coordinators supervising every night how the collection duties are carried out in all routes in their corresponding city margin. “We supervise ourselves if some of [the collection teams] don’t do the work responsibly. We don’t wait for the municipality to call us, we talk and fix issues among ourselves,” explained a leader (Int-SI-11). A long-term member of the other CSO clarified their supervisory role: “I am now rotating as a coordinator … to oversee the entire cleaning routine each day. Each of the 10 members of the board of directors rotate, one month yes, one month no … We also control the weighing of recycling as part of our coordinator tasks” (Int-SI-13). As simple as it may seem that street sweeping is, these CSOs take it very seriously. They care about their organizations’ performance. That is why training members for the task is central to the efficiency and quality of the operation. A leader explained: 230 At the end of each sweeper’s shift by the end of each month, one day before, each outgoing sweeper makes her route with the incoming sweepers of the following month. There they train them and teach what they should do and not do. Knowledge is transmitted in practice to do the job well on behalf of our CENCOPPS [standing for Sicuani Community Kitchen Central, one for each city margin] (Int-SI-13). Collection routes are worked by teams of two members that work for one month and are then relayed by a new team. These teams are selected typically in alphabetical or some other order based on need within each small community kitchen, which have to be members of one of the two umbrella CSOs. Each small community kitchen has a quota of participants that is based on their membership size. Then these smaller CSOs pass along the names to their umbrella CSO which leads the entire operation in their city margin. Routes are distributed by the umbrella CSOs based on difficulty –– the board considers factors such as the age, health, and strength of team members. This is because some streets can go uphill or are longer or rough when pushing tricycles full of waste inside (Int-SI-12). Husbands also participate in the service provision process, mainly following the collection trucks from behind across the different routes during the night. They help unload all the waste in the tricycles into the trucks (Ethnog-SI-9). The work is carried out efficiently even though people mistreat them in the streets. In response to their strategic planning and leadership commitment to their members, both umbrella CSOs also created offshoot recycling associations with separate boards. Waste collected by each team of two members is weighed and registered by the assigned recycling supervisors. At the end of the month, this is added to account for each team’s contribution. Each team gets paid a portion of this once the recycled material gathered by all collection teams is sold 231 in a major city, either in the cities of Cusco or Juliaca in Puno. “The rest we save as CENCOPPS,” said a leader (Int-SI-13). The recycling operation is also a coordinated family event. Trucks are loaded with all collected recyclables, with husbands and kids helping out putting everything in packs, tying them up, and then accommodating everything until the truck’s roof is full and covered so that nothing falls when it leaves for Cusco or Juliaca (Ethno-SI-7). Their long-term development vision ––supported by a strategic planning capacity and transparent use of funds form collection and recycling–– was further revealed by how they make decisions that have future implications: “At the end of the two years of the board of directors’ [term], in a [general] assembly, we decide what to invest it in, in some project for the benefit of all [members] … We do not have corruption problems internally because we separate the roles very well” (Int-SI-13). Their recycling work is carried out independently and with their own resources, although both CSOs have received some guidance from the municipality to obtain press machines to compress recyclables (Int-SI-17, Ethno-SI-7). Some support was also obtained from a national government program to which they presented a proposal, competed, and won, after having to contribute a portion of the costs to get the machines (Int-SI-17, Ethno-SI-7). Their role in recycling is essential for waste disposal in the city, helping reduce the amount of waste that would otherwise reach the dump, further aggravating the problem of disposal mismanagement. It is not done systematically, however, and on a large scale. It is also not an easy task. It depends on how each team of two women collecting waste daily can sort through the collected waste bags to separate recyclables simultaneously as they conduct their routes and before they unload everything on the collector trucks. This sorting is hence conducted in an unsystematic and improvised way. Thus, it reveals that it is not part of a CSO or municipal 232 strategy to improve waste disposal performance in the city, which stands in considerable contrast to what they do for waste collection. Yet, these CSOs work is not only about efficiency. There is a fellowship that that is developed as members work together picking up waste and recycling, strengthening their commitment to each other and to the organization every night. Exemplifying the depth of genuine care for each other and their organizations, a leader wholeheartedly shared her thoughts as we walked their routes from 2:00am to 4:45am at below freezing temperatures and roughly 12,000 feet above sea level: Sweeping and picking up waste at night starts with getting together at 1:30am, sipping [together] our cañazo [cane liquor] and pijchando [chewing] our coquita [coca leaf]. This gives us strength for this intense work and protects us from diseases. This is how we have survived the pandemic. We feel the cold [at night], the cold is strong. The cane liquor has a little honey and lemon, it is to strengthen our immunity, it also gives us energy. As coordinator, I bring all this to share with everyone while I do my supervision route. The compañeras [comrades] expect that, it is a way of motivating them too. My task is to visit all the routes, see how the work is done, talk to the compañeras to see if they are okay, and share which is important for them to feel good. The work is hard and exhausting … When I make each stop, we chat for a while. We laugh. That’s good. They also tell me if there was any problem … Working overnight is hard for all of us but we do it for our necessities. Sweeping is simple but the cold is tough, the fatigue. But we got used to it. It is good that you come to see how we do it, what the work is like, it is sacrificed and nobody recognizes us (Int-SI-16). The deep sense of companionship further solidifies their organizational capacity. The planning and implementation are conducted with a sense of duty and meaning, for members and the city. Thus, their contribution to collection performance is significant, and at a smaller scale to disposal through recycling. Another CSO participates in waste disposal. They are an indigenous community. It selects 10 members to work at the dump and five in composting through a lottery. If they had 233 worked on one of these tasks before members can still be chosen based on their livelihood urgencies. “To assess the need, we receive requests from each [member] –– [for example] for health, for their kids’ higher education studies. If there are these needs, we no longer raffle [the selection], we choose them directly. The rest is drawn through the lottery” (Int-SI-26). The sensitivity to individual problems, as in the case of the collection CSOs, help strengthen the board of directors’ legitimacy. Family ties and the shared ethnic identity and lands also play a role. Their contributions for waste disposal are also significant, though tainted by municipal mismanagement. The CSO allowed the municipality to operate a disposal site ––not a dump–– in their communal lands. Without this space, as abandoned as it is, the city’s situation could have been worse with more damaging and dramatic contamination to natural resources, production, and health. However, the problematic conditions of the dump also respond to their own organizational limitations. They do have structural specialization, with six specialized subcommittees. One focuses on environmental issues in the community, including overseeing waste management and work at the dump. These subcommittees directly support the board’s work, informing them of issues needing solutions (Int-SI-26). Given the dumps serious problems, they struggle to manage their oversight role as a board and Subcommittee. They have not visited the site since around June, which is a gap of three months from the time the interview was conducted. Their diagnostic is clear but without much effective workplan in place. “There is a lack of waste sorting at homes … But if it is thrown into a single tricycle, why bother to separate? We must make them sort. It is easy for them to throw away, throw away and pile up. It may have consequences later,” mentioned a leader (Int-SI-26). Immediately after that comment, another board member added revealing the 234 lack of supervision on the matter: “Mr. President, we must make time to go ourselves to the dump” (Int-SI-26). The lack of strategic planning, operational capacity, and commitment are apparent. While they continuously demand the municipality to manage the dump better, the CSO does not offer any working alternative to solve the problem jointly. An option would be collaborating with the Waste Suboffice to devise together a plan to supplement the evident administrative difficulties of this municipal unit to manage the disposal service. Yet, it is not on the CSOs leaders’ minds hence not an option on the table. Initially, lending part of the CSO's property to the municipality was part of an agreement with other items. The municipality has not respected its part, however. In the meantime, damage is done to the community's land, rivers, and agriculture. Thus, the current CSO's organizational capacity is insufficient: they do not draft plans or actions to help their community’s environmental sustainability by tackling the urgent waste disposal problem. CSOs in Sicuani are characterized by a profound role and participation in the provision of waste services. Yet, the degree to which they are involved in providing collection services relative to disposal services is much higher and impactful. This contributes to performance differences between the two. CSOs have significant, direct contributions to waste collection performance in Sicuani, led by highly efficient CSOs. In disposal, the CSO’s planning and operational capacity are insufficient to affect waste disposal performance. Satipo. CSOs in Satipo also tend to lack internal subcommittees dedicated to targeted tasks and strategies. What is distinctive, however, is that duties assigned to community members pertaining waste services get carried out adequately without much pressure from leaders. This results from, one, a greater commitment to the CSO and, two, stronger CSO planning and 235 operational capacity to mobilize their communities and engage with the Waste and Governance suboffices. These features produce closer communications with the municipality to solve community needs. CSO members sort recyclables, organics, and disposables domestically for municipal collection and the CSO neighboring the dump holds meetings to oversee the disposal facility’s management so that it does not cause discomfort or harm the community. Since their approach to problem-solving is more collectively oriented, unlike Bagua Grande that is more individually-inclined, internal coordination to implement these activities is easier and more efficient. Membership engagement is hence higher. Leaders explained how planning, operational capacity, and membership commitment works: We coordinate with the neighbors so that they sort their waste because it is good for us because otherwise it looks ugly … I report it in our [general] assembly [meetings]. Those who do not are warned … There are [general] assembly meetings once a month. We talk about solid waste and improvements, the activities, about providing trash bins to neighbors with stores –– there is a lot of garbage and we inform children to [properly] throw it away. Out of three meetings, we touch on the [waste] subject one time –– one time every three months (Int-SA-26). There was a training and they learned to sort waste … In a meeting we agreed to work for a clean community, but we had to insist. More meetings, more talks [were needed]. Fines were announced in the [general] meeting … But I never put [fines] because they started to do it, we never had to knock on doors and warn or supervise the streets … [but] we went [outside] each house to verify the area (Int-SA-28). 236 One community went a step further to carry out its role in waste services, specializing its internal structure: Internally, for solid waste, yes, we have an environment secretariat on the board – – 1 responsible per street, there are three in total. They supervise. We have appointed 3 members of the board of directors for this issue, they are three people in three [different] streets (Int-SA-30). While some CSOs face capacity and commitment challenges, most had these capabilities. These are key conditions for implementing internally and externally agreed upon objectives to improve communities. Their involvement is mostly a contribution to both selective collection and an early disposal stage, hence supporting Satipo’s high performance in both waste services. Likewise, the pressure on the municipality by the community neighboring the disposal facility –– constantly demanding proper smell control from rotten waste and leachate–– while indirect, is also crucial. It keeps the municipality alert and responsive to properly managing waste disposal, contributing to its performance. The disposal part of CSOs’ participation does not necessarily entail conducting a significant part of this complex service or even leading it. However, what they are collectively committed to do at home by diligently sorting their waste in three different types, following instructions on how to do it and when to take the bags out, is a highly critical role for disposal. These are time consuming activities, requiring planning and disciplined community members within the household even though they face livelihood struggles daily. CSO involvement has great value because it persists despite challenges. They receive limited support. Their community members struggle to make ends meet. Yet, they have all dedicated time to training, supervising, and convincing one by one. This is why their actions are 237 significant achievements that reflect upon these CSOs’ strong organizational capacity for planning, managing teams and operations, and some internal specialization. Conditions and Mechanisms. The evidence from the three cases shows how a specialized structure, strategic planning, and operational capability are essential organizational capacity attributes in CSOs for waste service performance. Having a specialized unit with dedicated teams means more attention is given to a particular service or issue, such as in the case of some CSOs in Satipo and those in Sicuani. A CSO with a strategic plan indicates that they have made a collective effort to think in detail about their problems and needs and the set of actions they can take to address them and promote community development, in the short- and long-term. The two community kitchens in Sicuani leading waste collection are good examples. The opposite would be to take any opportunity believed to help the community immediately, without a clear idea regarding whether and when this will be true, like in Bagua Grande. The operational capacity of a CSO indicates they have both the management capability and the human resources and equipment to lead in some activity, such as a waste service. CSOs in Sicuani and Satipo are also illustrative. However, while these organizational capacity attributes are necessary to help improve waste collection performance, they do not contribute similarly to waste disposal performance. Unlike what is observed from CSOs in Satipo and Bagua Grande, whose involvement has less relative depth or is absent, respectively, the substantial capacity to thoroughly plan and implement actions is notable in Sicuani. The committed membership ––thus strong operational capacity–– of the two community kitchen CSOs in Sicuani singlehandedly results in this service’s high performance. However, their role in recycling, which helps with disposal, is 238 minimal. Its small scale shows that some parts are still not as carefully considered. Yet, their contribution is important, reflecting these CSOs’ organizational strength. Unlike recycling in Bagua Grande, conducted upon routine without detailed planning, CSOs in Sicuani are relatively better prepared for this task. On disposal, CSOs’ planning and operations are limited. They are insufficient to help waste disposal performance. CSOs have a more direct role in Sicuani, unlike Satipo and Bagua Grande. They also have more at stake because the dump is on one CSOs’ property, with currently damaging consequences to their natural resources and members’ livelihoods. Although the Sicuani CSO involved in disposal is internally specialized and has a subcommittee focused on waste disposal, with a large membership, they still have not had a meaningful impact on improving disposal performance. No planning, oversight, or collaboration initiatives are in place. In Satipo, the CSO neighboring the disposal facility has been much more effective in influencing disposal performance. Their demands and negotiations, forceful at times, regarding smell control at the facility have led the Waste Suboffice to take corrective measures. Yet, this is also likely a result of the suboffice’s higher administrative capacity relative to Sicuani’s weak suboffice. Nonetheless, no CSO in Bagua Grande or Satipo has trusted the municipality and committed to risking a portion of their land with waste disposal to serve its city. This distinguishes the significant contribution of Sicuani’s CSO in waste disposal. Regardless of their poor capacity and involvement in service provision, Sicuani’s CSO has lent a portion of their lands for disposal –– without this generosity, the consequences of a mismanaged dump could have been potentially more damaging for the entire city. 239 c) Leadership is more committed and capable to strategize and organize members for collection, but disposal has requirements beyond available skills. Any organizational capacity built (or not), its membership commitment, and CSOs' role in waste service performance are also the product of leadership (Baggetta et al. 2013; Han et al. 2011). What leaders prioritize, and whether and how they plan their organizational strategies, matter for the relative involvement of a CSO in waste collection and disposal. The management of membership participation, service issues, resource acquisition, and waste suboffice relations partly depends on the leader’s work. Leadership mobilization and inspiration of its teams and community are crucial for effective involvement in waste service provision. However, some factors may hinder leaders from moving forward with their involvement in waste services. The studied CSOs support both collection and disposal in various ways and degrees. However, the more complex features of waste disposal and the magnitude of its problems to adequately provide it could overwhelm leaders. In some cases, this sense of unpreparedness may even occur in the context of waste collection. Upon assessing their management and technical skills, along with their CSOs’ operational capabilities, some leaders themselves may decide not to take part in a task collectively. At times, even approaching the Waste Suboffice ––or any municipal office–– can be perceived by leaders as a burdensome endeavor. Leadership abilities in CSOs are thus crucial for their participation in service provision. Bagua Grande. CSO leaders in Bagua Grande have not developed a systematic or strategic relationship with the Waste Suboffice and local political authorities. Most of what they do gives the impression of being sporadic, specific bureaucratic coordination with the municipality. They 240 do not appear to have much negotiation power or a planned strategy to demand the Suboffice to commit more fully to work with them. The result is that these CSOs have no significant involvement in waste services. While this participation could be a much-needed contribution to the livelihoods of their members, leaders have not managed to develop a more formal, sustained support. Resources, such as working equipment and infrastructure, are also limited. Most CSO leaders have more than four years in decision-making positions in their organizations, but they have not secured any of this. “To achieve that, we need more union. We are a divided organization. Before, [another problem] was because the lot is far away, there is no electricity … we don’t have an organizational budget,” stated a CSO leader referring to not having a more solid, resourceful, and equipped organization (Int-BG-8). CSOs lack street sweeping equipment, illustrating limited leadership skills for organizational strengthening (Int-BG-24). Members are not motivated to participate in waste services due to low municipal interest because CSO leaders had not reached out (Int-BG-26). CSOs leaders in Bagua Grande have also shown limited negotiation skills. CSOs used to participated in street sweeping. Those that worked received in-kind food assistance from the municipality for 15 days of full-time work. There was no monetary payment. Each received about 55 lbs. of rice, 11 lbs. of sugar, and one gallon of cooking oil for families of at least five with young children. CSOs informally agreed to this unfavorable negotiation and membership participation has declined. “[W]e complemented our [sweeping] teams with mothers from another club … [Our members] said that the food ration was very little, although they need it,” said a leader (Int-BG-29). Leaders have had limited capacity to advocate for their organizations. 241 Recyclers had a similar experience. They obtained municipal assistance from a negotiation but is largely insufficient. They obtained working space in a small, abandoned shack with flimsy plastic bag walls in the corner of a municipal vehicle parking lot where they store recyclables. Likewise, municipal workers collect a few bags with recyclables from main streets, which is delivered to the association. Yet, the amount is insufficient to make a living. The municipality, however, receives at least USD 1 or 2 million annually in additional budget from the Ministry of Finance by meeting nationally-established goals for waste sorting using reports from the association’s own work (Int-BG-1, Int-BG-8; MINAM 2016). “The municipality receives resources and they only give us the garbage thrown on the floor,” complained a CSO leader (Int-BG-8). CSO leadership does not negotiate successfully for their organizations. Similarly, they hardly find mechanisms to support members’ livelihoods. That partly explains their issues with sustained involvement in collection and their ineffective role in disposal, having no contribution to waste service performance. Sicuani. Strong, organized, and dedicated leadership is a feature of CSOs in Sicuani. Their tangible achievements range from having a budget, acquiring waste collection and recycling equipment, and building their organizational establishment. Signed agreements with municipal authorities to support their communities also count toward their material accomplishments. Most importantly, however, are their immaterial gains. These leaders have built internally well-defined and -differentiated organizational structures and highly committed memberships for waste service provision –– this is the larger legacy of true leaders and what sustains solid organizations that grow for generations. Both the community kitchens and the indigenous community have 242 already existed for decades. Yet, these features describe the two community kitchens running the collection service more closely. The indigenous community also has these characteristics. Yet, it has struggled to accomplish more of its goals that are part of the agreement with the Suboffice. Struggling to protect the sustainability of their natural resources resulting from a mismanaged dump by the municipality is one of its main failures as a CSO. Upon arriving in Sicuani, I was invited to attend the 31st anniversary of one of the community kitchens. It was a marvelous feast. Most noticeable was the level of detailed attention put into organizing the event and how clearly they had defined roles between those leading it, primarily current and former board members. Although the collection work never stops, and they have other jobs to sustain their families, leaders had planned the event’s financing ahead of time. Lunch for invited authorities was paid for using the umbrella organization’s funds, and each individual community kitchen would provide lunch for its members. This must have involved several coordination meetings, analyzing organizational financial accounts, deciding how to fund the event, and defining multiple activities and roles. Politicians were also present, but these CSO leaders are skilled and know how engage with these actors (Int-SI-14). They are aware politicians have tried to use them for votes, ineffectively. In turn, they have held them closely accountable for their support offerings once in power. In their speeches during the ceremony, they forcefully and candidly expressed that no authority had supported them, that no one had given them anything, neither the mayors nor environmental managers (Ethno-SI-1). These leaders are skilled and tenacious. Both umbrella community kitchens celebrated the endurance of their organizations for that many years, despite the stark poverty of their members, all vulnerable indigenous women. What they showed, in fact, was how invulnerable they were: full of skill, resourcefulness, and 243 passion, but above all, a remarkable capacity to plan and diligently follow through to achieve their collective goals for decades. They have constructed two unwavering social support community organizations with nothing else but an atypical asset: caring leadership. This trait has been taught, learned, and passed on to generations of leaders in both CSOs. Under severe material limitations, generous leadership mentoring like this keeps community organizations afloat. One of the leaders recognized this legacy during an interview: Our organization is strengthened by the knowledge of the leaders of previous boards of directors and the presence of founders. Today there are 10 elder mommies, founders. One of them in her 70s is on my current board of directors. When we don’t know something or need guidance, we call on the eldest to ask them to teach and guide us. We consult them to do the job well, to know how something was resolved before (Int-SI-13). The humility of their leaders and respect for the experience of past generations is a critical asset for the arduous tasks they conduct to manage the city’s entire waste collection service. Past experiences contain major lessons, from their view, and they pass on the knowledge to all new leaders (Int-SI-17). They have also learned that to treat each other with respect and appreciation is essential for the organization. One of several occasions I noticed this was a day when the teams were cleaning up after the overnight collection routine and were sorting the recyclables. I was interviewing one of the leaders. Several women would come to consult her to weigh their bags with recyclables. She stays attending me and hands her records’ notebook where she writes down the weight of each pair of tricycles to another lady so that they can continue with the registration process. Another lady approaches her and kindly asks if she could weigh her bags later because she must urgently go to the prosecutor’s office due to an issue with her husband. She asks very 244 respectfully and affectionately. The coordinator agrees, answering in the same manner, and tells her they could weigh the bags on Sunday, two days later (Ethno-SI-5). This sincere warmth and considerate rapport were also observed in several instances during fieldwork participant observations and interviews (Ethno-SI-1, Ethno-SI-8, Ethno-SI-9; Int-SI-11, Int-SI-16). Besides their carefully developed plans, strategies, and detailed oversight of daily routines, these leaders are perceived as legitimate and appreciated by members, who are committed and work harder. This characteristic adds to the multiple factors explaining these CSOs’ key contribution to high waste collection performance in Sicuani as well as its partial benefits to waste disposal through recycling. Leadership in the indigenous community CSO is less successful. However, the issues they have had to face regarding waste disposal are hardly comparable to those of the two community kitchens managing waste collection, given the complexity of disposal. Relative to brooms and tricycles, the specificity of physical assets, technical knowledge, and the high costs required for waste disposal operations are beyond what a community CSO could afford, particularly if most of its members live below the poverty line. Carefully drafting a collaboration plan with the municipality and closer formal communications and negotiations could have been a safe alternative. This would have involved pressuring the Suboffice to at least make sure that the 409,000 Peruvian Soles [USD 105,412] that ––according to a manager from the Budget Suboffice–– are available to maintain the dumpsite, were adequately used (Int-SI-24). However, the community’s leadership seems paralyzed due to how disconcerted, disappointed, and overwhelmed they feel over the dump’s failed management which they trusted the municipality. “They never call us to think about problems or solutions [for the dump] … We will request a work plan from the municipality so that more than burying [waste] is done,” said a 245 leader as if they were waiting for the Suboffice to draft a plan and reach out to them to work together (Int-SI-26). Thus, no new ideas flow for alternative, creative solutions to protect the community’s health and resources. “We seek to enforce the agreement with the municipality, but it is only partially fulfilled,” added another frustrated, helpless leader (Int-SI-26). While the magnitude of the problem is greater, the absence of entrepreneurial leadership is manifest in this community CSO. This context further explains the low performance of waste disposal and the missing contributions of CSOs to its adequate provision in Sicuani. Therefore, Sicuani has extraordinary leadership in the CSOs involved in waste collection, entirely and efficiently delivering the service, but their absence in waste disposal is notorious. This is partly explained by the leadership limitations faced by the CSO participating in disposal that moves forward without planned strategies for action or negotiation with the municipality to ensure the area’s sustainability and proper service provision. Leaders in this CSO is overcome with frustration, having resorted to entirely blaming the Suboffice for the dump’s dire state of abandonment. Thus, leadership in Sicuani shows a critical causal mechanism to explain the observed performance gap between waste collection and disposal. Satipo. CSOs in Satipo are successful at achieving their objectives. Their leaders are dedicated and skillful. CSOs are mainly focused on waste sorting that contributes to collection and an early disposal task. One community CSO oversees proper disposal because it is located right next to the disposal facility. This means that leaders in each of these CSOs have different sets of tasks required of them. Thus, the nature of their interactions with the Waste and the Governance suboffices are not the same. Regardless of these distinctions, all CSO leaders are typically characterized by more closely following through their groups’ plans and objectives, focused on 246 community development. Most have seamless communication with community members and demonstrate persistence through their regular visits or calls to the suboffices demanding municipal action on waste services for their people. CSO leaders’ have a different skillset, benefiting how their communities handle waste sorting at the household level. They are highly entrepreneurial, motivated, and experienced as community leaders. Some have more than six years in leadership positions (Int-SA-16, Int-SA-26, Int-SA-28, Int-SA-30). They prepare formal documentation on their own for formal requests to the municipality and are involved in numerous community-related tasks (Int-SA-16, Int-SA-30). They collect inputs from members and make decisions by consensus and dialogue. Thus, they are transparent and aware that better decisions are made collectively. The legitimacy of their decisions, and their leadership, are high (Int-SA-16, Int-SA-26, Int-SA-28, Int-SA-30). To exemplify their strong commitment and close attention to community matters, one leader approached me in his community’s streets, asking if I needed help as my research assistant and I did our SSO rounds early in a morning. The same leadership traits are observed in the community neighboring the disposal facility. They organize the community around a larger development vision, while pragmatic about what is feasible to demand from the municipality. Leaders know their members’ limitations and hence work hard to carefully communicate problems in perspective. One leader illustrated how they strategically manage issues regarding the disposal facility: 247 I seek to explain the community … the challenges to be solved. I am focused on finding solutions and not making problems to the problem. Many don’t understand about technical workshops [on disposal management] … I focused on [clarifying] that [to them] and today we see the results. It was very difficult … achieved with constant coordination with the municipality. With the community, [explaining] the administrative part is difficult, but we are achieving results … [Disposal] performance has improved at 90% … [P]ersonnel’s equipment was renewed, the fulfillment of some commitments, and the tranquility of the population with the disappearance of the [bad] smell almost entirely (Int-SA-15). These are not easy results to obtain, and are the product of intense pressure and negotiation, carefully conducted by the CSO’s leadership. They sat with managers from the Waste and Governance suboffices, the Environmental Office, and municipal political authorities. They understand how to, subtly and skillfully, navigate the passionate views of community members and the municipality to achieve collective objectives. Leaders in Satipo are thus focused on solving community matters in both collection and disposal. Unlike in Bagua Grande, where leaders are less resourceful, here they have the skills to devise strategies with clear goals and sit in front of municipal authorities to pressure for responsiveness. They also mobilize their communities effectively. Therefore, they have made important progress on both waste services for their communities. While the process is not without setbacks, leaders continue to work toward the goals of improving waste service performance for the benefit of their people. Most of these leaders have the drive and planning capacity to deliver. Conditions and Mechanisms. Leadership skills and commitment have a meaningful influence over CSO involvement in service provision and its contributions to performance. In the case of waste, leaders’ actions determine whether the municipality opens the door for participation and their responsiveness to CSO demands. Particularly, the degree to which leaders approach a 248 municipal office, request meetings to be listened to, negotiate their involvement in waste services and benefits for members, and obtain improvements in the quality of the waste services received are determinant actions for CSO participation. These activities are partly contingent on leaders’ abilities to strengthen organizational capacity. This includes drafting organizational strategies, implementing measures that respond to community needs, transparently managing the CSO, and elaborating substantiated arguments to benefit their entire community. All these actions also increase membership commitment and support for the organization. Effective participation in waste collection occurs when these leadership characteristics are present. Adequate collection performance is associated with the work of involved CSO leaders. However, these leadership skills are more likely to contribute to collection than disposal performance. The increased complexity of disposal likely limits the extent to which CSO leaders know how to make contributions. If the overall organizational capacity of a CSO does not match the physical and technical knowledge requirements of service operations, which tend to be highly specific when the service is more complex, then it is less likely that leadership will have a crucial role. Even if the leader obtains municipal approval to become involved, if the CSOs do not have the required capacity, then complex service provision improvements may be observed. For example, leaders in Satipo have organized their communities to sort waste and make demands to improve landfill management. However, their role is indirect since the municipality entirely runs the service. In Sicuani, CSOs recycle on a small scale, lend part of their lands for disposal, and contribute only with the few members working at the dump and in composting. Both are also indirect roles. Yet, waste disposal performance is moderate in the former city and poor in the latter, with CSOs having limited participation. 249 Therefore, the evidence from the three cases shows that CSO leadership is crucial for service provision, mainly if the service is simple, such as collection. If the CSO’s overall capacity does not correspond with the needs of a more complex service, then leadership may not have a role, such as in disposal. 5.3 Conclusions This chapter illustrates the four conditions discussed in the introductory section and the causal mechanisms through which they work. First, the capacity of the municipal office to handle CSO relations is crucial for their involvement. Overwhelmed administrators with scarce resources and support carry out their routine managerial tasks with significant challenges, as shown in Chapter 4. Interacting with CSOs demands considerable effort when this is not part of their daily activities. When administrative capacity exists, managers devise plans for service provision that involve CSOs as key actors to achieve higher performance. Second, the perceptions of municipal authorities about CSOs and their members influence the extent to which CSOs become involved in service provision. In the case of waste, community CSOs are composed of low-income individuals. In Bagua Grande and Sicuani, their members are primarily women, mostly from indigenous ethnic backgrounds. When people in local positions of power have implicit or explicit prejudices about their members and the organization more generally, CSO participation is limited. These biased views result in these organizations being regarded as less capable ––without justification or intention of supporting their strengthening–– restricting their involvement with the municipality to more specific tasks typically focused on street sweeping. Even if the local government needs labor to address dramatic waste service problems, CSOs are not considered worthy partners. However, when 250 discrimination is not part of the decision-making equation, CSOs engage and lead with less barriers. They are provided the support needed to strengthen the organization to help the municipality provide better waste services. Nonetheless, this is mainly observed in waste collection and less in waste disposal. Decision-makers’ perceptions about CSOs and their members are thus sufficient to preclude or bolster CSO participation in service provision. Third, the causal mechanisms also exemplify how CSO capacity is highly relevant for their participation in service provision and their contributions to performance. CSOs with a development-inspired organizational mission with a long-term view of their communities’ wellbeing have a more effective service participation. They dedicate more effort to organizational strengthening and have closer relationships with the municipality, especially if the service is simple. Similarly, internally specialized CSOs with a robust operational capacity based on strategic planning provide more effective involvement in service provision. CSO leadership allows them to negotiate their participation better, further strengthen the organization, and mobilize members based on commitment, all of which is crucial for service performance. Overall, the evidence shows that CSO organizational capacity is a central, necessary factor for service provision performance but mainly when the service is simple, such as waste collection. Current CSO capacity is insufficient to help improve the performance of a more complex service, such as waste disposal. This means that more CSO capacity is determinant when municipal capacity is low, which allows the CSO to have an essential role in supplementing or replacing the municipality in service provision. Yet, this is more likely when the service is simple. When the service is more complex, the evidence does not show CSOs help performance regardless of capacity. This indicates that the literature may need to reconsider that CSOs cannot provide some services. Of course, this is also contingent on the degree to which the 251 responsible municipal office has the capacity to manage the relationship and involvement of the CSO and if decision-makers are willing to help strengthen CSO capacity so that it can engage in such services. Fourth, the complexity of the service determines the degree to which CSOs participate and influence performance. Matching CSO organizational capacity with service requirements is a determinant factor. This is observed in the gaps in CSO participation when comparing waste collection and disposal and in the extent of CSO contributions to performance in the two services. These findings have some important implications for public administration research and policy-making. For research, it shows that CSOs do not necessarily have universal benefits for public service provision. Their organizational capacity ––in terms of internal structure, mission, human and operational resources, strategic plans, and leadership–– is crucial for how they interact with their municipal counterparts and their impact on service provision. If the service is simple, as in the case of waste collection, more capacity translates into higher involvement and significant performance influence; less capacity leads to less consistent involvement but consequential performance contributions. If the service is complex, like waste disposal, more capacity may entail that some participation may produce some performance effects, contingent on their relevance to service requirements and municipal relationship. Less capacity relative to service needs results in no involvement, thus no effect on complex service performance. For policy, the results demonstrate that working together with community CSOs has significant and varied positive consequences for service provision and local governance. Primarily supporting their organizational strengthening along with their operational and problem-solving participation for service provision will likely lead to noticeable service provision 252 improvements on the ground. For simple services, open communication channels and commitment to the relationship are key –– they can handle the rest as long as they have basic organizational capabilities to manage parts of such services. For more complex services, a closer CSO–municipality collaboration is critical. Focused involvement with gradual responsibility increases connected to results, paired with targeted organizational capacity-building that matches service requirements and open communication channels, may result in surprising performance contributions. To sum up, community CSOs have a role in service provision that has yet to reach its potential. The ball is now in the field of local governments to make this happen. 253 References Abarca-Guerrero, Lilliana, Ger Maas, and William Hogland. 2013. \"Solid Waste Management Challenges for Cities in Developing Countries.\" Waste Management 33(1): 220-232.

However, some perform exceedingly well in both (Kaza et al. 2018). This discrepancy in waste service performance is a global phenomenon illustrating the differential role of local governance in the provision of services when they vary in complexity. But why are some local governments successful at providing simple waste collection services while at the same time blatantly failing at providing complex waste disposal services, when other similar municipalities can do both? Studying Peruvian municipalities helps illustrate my dissertation’s arguments, where three core elements of local governance ––administrative capacity, CSOs, and local collaborative governance–– take center stage to reveal why and how service performance disparities occur. These factors elucidate a consequential pattern of service provision issues in Global South cities. In particular, I look at how service-specific municipal administrative capacity, formal community-based CSO involvement, and local cogovernance matter when services increase in relative complexity. Overall, my findings suggest that having service-specific capacity has a twofold effect: unlike general administrative capacity and other measures, it improves the performance of both simple and complex services and supports the influence of the other two factors on performance. I make four arguments to address my overarching puzzle, drawing on comparative quantitative and qualitative evidence. First, I claim that it is sufficient to have low service-specific administrative capacity or the involvement of community CSOs to adequately provide simple services like waste collection. On the one hand, I show municipal waste office 259 specialization improvements for waste collection likely result in higher performance in collection frequency and quantity. Local governments struggling with collection would likely benefit from administrative specialization and equipment for this specific service. The administrative conditions and mechanisms from three different organizational hierarchy levels expand these insights. I find that local government leaders ––such as politicians and top managers–– are informed and supportive of the requirements of a simple service like collection. After all, this is a politically and socially visible service that is easier to grasp, likely with important electoral implications (Avellaneda 2012; Bélanger and Meguid 2008; Kahneman 2002). While it is salient, it is also simple one –– collection has minimal administrative needs and can continue being provided under fragile, improvised office-level managerial environments. Yet, in the field, the mistreatment of waste workers is common due to the nature of job, regardless of service type –– handling trash is socially (but inaccurately) regarded as a task lacking dignity (Fredericks 2018). However, waste pickers are regularly seen working in the streets, unlike disposal workers. This means that waste pickers’ jobs and issues are more easily understood –– it is thus more likely that local authorities will at least try to address them. The cases of Bagua Grande, Sicuani, and Satipo illustrate these conditions for collection performance. On the other hand, CSOs’ organizational capacity is a crucial factor for service provision performance but mainly when the service is simple. Community-based CSOs such as neighborhood associations are more likely to help increase collection frequency, possibly making more rounds in support of local governments to pick up waste. The concentration of poverty-alleviation CSOs, however, tends to make waste collection more efficient by reducing waste picking rounds, possibly through their numerous members. While both CSOs are not associated 260 with improvements in collection quantity, they are at least more likely to help keep a city’s current conditions. These results indicate that such CSOs may be able to effectively supplement the state when services are relatively simple. Insights on the conditions and mechanisms further elucidate these findings. CSO participation in waste service provision is initially possible mainly if the municipal office has the administrative capacity to handle CSO relations, such as in Sicuani and Satipo. If administrators are overwhelmed, it is unlikely to occur as observed in Bagua Grande. Similarly, if municipal authorities have negative views of CSOs as organizations or biased, discriminatory perceptions of their members for their socioeconomics or indigenous backgrounds, these organizations would be regarded as less capable or restricted to tasks typically focused on street sweeping. This may happen even if the local government needs support in providing the service as exemplified in Bagua Grande. I also show that organizationally strong CSOs can manage waste collection efficiently and effectively. CSOs with a mission to promote long-term community development and organizational strengthening have better relations with the municipality and more effective participation. Collection performance is thus improved. Perhaps more importantly, CSO leadership is essential for strengthening the organization and building ties with the local government. This means that more CSO capacity is determinant when municipal capacity is low, which allows the CSO to have an essential role in supplementing or replacing the municipality in service provision, particularly when the service is simple. A poverty-reduction CSO led by women frm indigenous backgrounds in Sicuani and neighborhood association CSOs in Satipo demonstrate the different ways in which these CSO capabilities matter. Second, I argue that having high service-specific administrative capacity regarding office-level specialization and equipment is necessary to provide complex services such as waste 261 disposal adequately. Due to the more significant physical and human asset-specific requirements of complex services like disposal, community CSO involvement is not sufficient to support their performance. I show that waste management administrative capacity is the only local governance factor associated with improvements in proper waste disposal. Having relevant waste and environmental planning, policy instruments, and specific equipment for disposal are crucial for this service’s performance. This is true in municipalities like Satipo, where differentiated capacity to equally understand and carry out both waste services ––not just collection–– at the top leadership, management office team, and field worker levels exists. Top leadership is highly committed to disposal, capacity at the office level is highly specialized and equipped for this service, and disposal workers are treated with dignity and respect. These are fundamental conditions for improving complex service performance. However, the conditions and causal mechanisms studied reveal that these administrative characteristics are usually absent for disposal in the three organizational hierarchy levels, as the cases of Bagua Grande and Sicuani illustrate, explaining poor waste disposal outcomes. Local decision-makers have a superficial understanding of this service’s complex requirements, and, since disposal sites are in non-visible, distant locations, it is further neglected. Within the office, service-specific administrative capacity for disposal is lacking. In contrast with waste collection, this service fails under unspecialized, suboptimal administrative conditions. While all waste workers in the field tend to be dismissed by local authorities and society, disposal workers are not seen and hence typically ignored. Furthermore, CSOs have a distant involvement in disposal services, limiting their influence on performance. I find that community CSOs are not associated with performance improvements. This means that the presence of CSOs may not suffice to help strengthen the 262 provision of this complex service. When exploring the conditions and causal mechanisms of these results more carefully, my results show the crucial role of CSO organizational capacity. While waste offices tend to lack administrative specialization and hold a poor concept of CSOs for disposal ––which are led by low-income and indigenous peoples in Bagua Grande and Sicuani, respectively–– with negative CSO involvement consequences, existing CSO capacity is insufficient to help improve waste disposal performance. When the service is complex, CSOs do not help performance regardless of capacity. The literature may hence need to re-examine the fact that CSOs cannot provide some services. However, limited CSO involvement in this complex service is principally contingent on whether waste office capacity to manage the relationship exists and if decision-makers are committed to working with CSOs to help strengthen their capacity for more effective engagement. Satipo provides some critical insights. Ultimately, a service’s complexity determines whether CSOs participate and influence performance. Matching CSO organizational capacity with service requirements is a driving factor for CSO influence in complex service provision. This is observed in the gaps in CSO participation when comparing waste collection and disposal and in the extent of CSO contributions to performance in the two services. Third, I argue that general administrative capacity is insufficient to understand service provision performance accurately, especially as they vary in complexity. Although the literature on performance highlights important administrative features of public organizations to explain its influence, these are general, aggregate factors that are significantly distant from the actual management and implementation of a service. I show that general municipal administrative capacity improvements only enhance simple waste collection frequency, but it does not influence complex disposal. Nondirect, general municipal capacity factors such as more personnel, 263 technological hardware and software, or a results-based budgeting program are not critical for increasing the amount of waste collected or disposing of waste properly. The conditions and causal mechanisms examined seem to corroborate that when service implementation depends on high operational and technical knowledge, general capabilities cannot compensate for limitations in those areas. Local governments that build the administrative capacity tailored for a complex service are more likely to have high-performance levels, as found in Satipo. Lacking the required administrative capacity to provide a complex service leads to deficient performance levels. The cases of Bagua Grande and Sicuani demonstrate this problem. Finally, my fourth argument states that local collaborative governance arrangements such as cogovernance venues help improve service performance when it deals equally with complex and simple services in decision-making processes. My results show that cogovernance venues –– where municipal and CSO representatives jointly make local planning and budgeting decisions–– are associated with reduced collection frequency and increased quantity. The planning and budgeting decisions made in local cogovernance venues likely prioritize more efficient waste collection strategies, such as purchasing necessary equipment like compactor trucks. Cogovernance does not influence waste disposal performance –– its issues are probably not perceived as urgent in the studied venues. Disposal’s relative complexity and low immediate salience diminish the interest of municipal leadership and society, as shown throughout the municipal case studies. Why does Satipo perform better in providing both simple collection and complex disposal? My findings reveal that this municipality differs in that it has built service-specific capacity for both services, and CSOs are organizationally strong and committed to promoting community development. Top leadership understands and supports the operational and technical 264 requirements even of complex waste disposal. Waste suboffices have specialized and equipped their teams in different subunits to provide both equally. Morale and bias in the treatment experienced by field workers are minimal in collection and disposal. It has a Governance Suboffice with personnel capacity dedicated to managing community relations, including involving CSOs in waste service provision without discrimination toward poor or indigenous communities. Similarly, CSOs are focused on improving their communities’ well-being and have thus developed sufficient organizational strength to participate in both services in different ways. Looking at these local governance capabilities partly shows why simple collection and complex disposal perform well in this city relative to places like Bagua Grande and Sicuani, where the conditions favor collection over disposal. While it seems that this occurs because Satipo is a relatively wealthier local government and has allocated more resources per capita to waste management (see Table 2.2), this does not appear as the main factor in this municipality. Resource allocation is a political and technical decision, in the first place. Historically, the experience of Satipo with waste management started with a former mayor’s and his team’s experience with environmental management in another municipality within the province. There, they learned that to provide better, more holistic waste management, they needed to draft a comprehensive policy, create an organizational structure, build capacity, and develop an investment project to receive funds for this policy from the Ministry of Finance (Int-SA-35). The Ministry of Finance initially provided Satipo’s startup resources for waste management. This was the product of top leadership’s commitment to building service-specific administrative capacity equally for collection and disposal. This process started in 2015. After achieving all this, a new administration from a different political party was responsible for starting the entire operations from ground zero in 2019. With little guidance from 265 the Ministry of Environment, they decided to continue committed to this policy and administer waste services professionally (Int-SA-23). This new administration went further, fully closing the old dump, implementing waste reuse strategies, and redirecting the role of the Governance Suboffice toward getting communities involved (Int-SA-23, Int-SA-32). They could have avoided its full implementation due to the novelty and risks associated with this waste management approach in the country. Yet, they went ahead and figured it out. Satipo was selected as a case in this dissertation to precisely show why and how waste service performance can equally occur when services vary in complexity. Alternative explanations in addition to municipal financial resources are also considered. However, they do not have a significant role in the context of this research according to the data obtained. Municipal political alignment with the national government, inter-governmental collaborations, or international donor financing and technical assistance could also influence service outcomes. However, they do not occur in any of the three local governments in the context of waste service provision. These local bureaucracies carry out waste management on their own, exemplifying what tends to occur in most municipalities in Peru. 6.2 Contributions to Theory, Methodology, and Policy Overall, the approach of my dissertation matters for comparative public administration research because it suggests, first, a more nuanced analysis of service performance and, second, a deeper assessment of the effects and mechanisms by which service-specific capacity, CSOs, and local collaborations influence performance differences between more and less complex services. This dissertation thus accounts for the varying performance between a simple service, like waste 266 collection, and a more operationally and technically complex service, such as waste disposal, in Peruvian municipalities. Thus, my work makes two principal contributions to theory. First, it shows that service-specific administrative capacity more accurately explains service provision performance and observed gaps when services vary in complexity. Examining capacity and their distinctive conditions at different levels across the organizational hierarchy is crucial to understanding simple and complex service performance better. Thus, general capacity measures likely do not capture what we expect. More relevant or tighter research measures are hence identified so that analyses capture what is intended. Ultimately, this approach provides a more detailed understanding of performance –– it unravels the study of services and service performance by complexity level. This removes implicit assumptions that all services are equal. Second, it illustrates that CSOs do not always benefit public service provision. Their organizational capacity ––in terms of internal structure, mission, human and operational resources, strategic plans, and leadership–– affects whether and how they build a working relationship with their municipal counterparts for service provision. High capacity produces more robust participation and performance benefits if the service is simple. When capacity is poor, they can still have important performance contributions. If the service is complex, performance effects depend on the degree to which CSO capacity matches service requirements and their relationship with the local government. Less capacity relative to service needs results in no involvement, thus no effect on complex service performance. My dissertation also advances the rigorous use of diverse methodologies in public administration research through a deductive-inductive approach informed by theory and fieldwork. Using a mixed-methods research design has allowed me to obtain rich qualitative data 267 to show the conditions and causal mechanisms that explain the quantitative analysis's findings in detail. I employ a unique panel dataset of all Peruvian municipalities across three years for quantitative analysis of the effect of municipal capacity, CSO presence, and cogovernance on simple collection and complex disposal. Based on a comparative case selection strategy, I also draw on qualitative interview and ethnographic data from four and a half months of intensive fieldwork in three municipalities, which was used to comparatively analyze the conditions in which municipal capacity and CSO participation affect both waste services. This approach taught me why and how waste service performance disparities occur. This involved tracing the three local governance factors studied in relation to the provision of waste collection and disposal. I obtained information on specific organizational characteristics within municipal waste offices, the nature of the involvement of community CSOs in service provision and their organizational features, and local decision-making processes regarding waste. Similarly, I collected detailed data on the performance of both waste services, understanding the processes and issues of waste collection in the streets and at waste disposal, recycling, and composting sites. While my panel dataset is rich, it does not provide this detailed evidence on the conditions and causal mechanisms leading to performance disparities in waste services. Semi-structured interviews, participant and direct observation, systematic social observation, and secondary source analysis are the techniques I used to gather these data on my independent and dependent variables in the field. This methodological approach has different benefits. First, it allows obtaining deep insights into the key explanatory factors and the processes through which they affect outcomes. With this kind of evidence, we can uncover what is driving the relationship in more detail and observe the multiple layers of how the interactions take place. A rigorous, data-driven, and 268 carefully studied case selection strategy is fundamental for this to work. Controlling for alternative confounding factors is crucial for a sound case study comparison. Second, the research's internal and external validity is strengthened, producing a more solid causal inference. This is typically the ultimate goal of social science research. Therefore, integrating methodologies to obtain different, complementary layers of evidence that further illuminate causal processes significantly enriches knowledge, social science, the relevant fields, and policy-making. My dissertation mainly informs comparative public administration research, which is a field that could benefit from increased methodological diversity and integration. Steps that help us get somewhat closer to the truth of relevant social science phenomena, while more time-consuming and demanding additional effort, are worthwhile for the significance of their contributions to expanding our understanding of real-world problems. This dissertation also has three general implications for policy. First, strengthening service-specific administrative capacity at the local level is necessary for performance improvements in complex service provision. It is crucial to invest in reinforcing office capacity – –from an administratively holistic approach–– to directly tackle problems of performance that tend to affect complex services more. Typical immediate reactions such as hiring managers and teams with better general training or increasing the overall office budget to acquire equipment or hire experts would not help. It is thus fundamental to have a holistic approach to administrative capacity. Focusing on specific service needs, especially if it is complex, is crucial. This requires assessing the structure, policies and procedures, human resources, equipment, and how compassionate the leadership is with field workers. Having the right perspective matters to distinguish policy measures by service complexity. Putting them aside for being too complex 269 affects communities and sustainability in the short- and long-term –– policy performance is essential for well-being and development. Second, supporting the involvement of community-based CSOs and local collaborations is essential to keep the streets clean. Constant communication and commitment to the relationship are crucial. While the benefits of CSO participation in complex service provision are few in the context of this research, there is significant potential contingent on municipal capacity and openness to their contributions. If CSO organizational strengthening is prioritized by the local government, looking toward a more effective partnership for service operation and problem-solving, complex service provision will likely benefit. A closer CSO–municipality collaboration is hence essential. Increasing their responsibilities gradually in connection to results, complemented by targeted organizational capacity-building to match service requirements and open communication channels, may produce important performance advancements. Finally, the two policy implications illustrate that distinguishing policy measures by service complexity helps to address service performance issues more effectively, especially for those with environmental sustainability implications in weak, vulnerable Global South cities. 6.3 Limitations and Future Research This dissertation has some limitations that future research could address. One is that the datasets on Peruvian municipalities do not contain information on CSOs involved in specific services or local cogovernance, particularly for waste services. Future research could conduct municipal surveys to collect these data. Similarly, closer coordination with national authorities could help to systematically gather more detailed municipal-level data on specific services that 270 vary in complexity, such as in waste management, that would contribute to a closer analysis of service provision in the country. Exploring service performance differences by regional or municipal subgroups could also reveal puzzling patterns. Another limitation is the number of cases used in this dissertation. While the three cases examined provide significant evidence on the conditions and mechanisms of local governance driving waste service performance gaps, additional comparable cases would further strengthen the findings. Future research could include more municipalities in the three prioritized categories (see diagram 2.1). It could also include cases from the high administrative capacity –– low CSO involvement category that was not explored –– where service outsourcing is expected. More research should be done to verify the findings of this dissertation in different places in Peru or the world. Moreover, since this dissertation focuses on medium-sized municipalities, future studies could explore smaller and larger municipalities to assess whether different drivers and conditions explain differential waste service outcomes or if they hold current results. Expanding this line of work to cities in other similar Global South countries would improve its generalizability. An additional limitation of this dissertation is that it does not sufficiently explore the role of three crucial factors: issue salience, local political and social conflict, and indigenous peoples’ CSOs. Future work could evaluate whether and how they influence waste service performance disparities. 271 6.4 Big Picture Questions for Scholarship The field of public administration is growing more complex and specialized. At the same time, it is becoming more thematically focused and possibly less relevant for real-world policymaking and social issues. It has also become more methodologically narrow (Bertelli and Riccucci 2022; Dodge et al. 2005; Ospina et al. 2018; Raadschelders 2011; Raadschelders and Lee 2011). Given this context, through this dissertation I have aimed to somehow address these larger issues in the public administration field. The field’s complexity is reflected in the increasing number of disciplines it draws from and an apparent persistence in the use of either quantitative and qualitative methods of analysis, although more clearly relying on the former (Grimmelikhuijsen et al. 2017, 47-48; Groeneveld et al. 2015). Epistemologically, however, newer generations of public administration scholars can be generally described as fundamentally positivists, primarily seeking to address questions of causality with large samples or based on experiments and regression methods (Pitts and Fernandez 2009; Riccucci 2010). Some would argue that current research is more centered on public management than on public administration per se, emphasizing the role of individual behavior and general organizational characteristics focusing on outputs and outcomes (Behn 1995; Hill and Lynn Jr. 2015; Meier 2008). Studies are thus less focused on addressing the influence (and path-dependencies) of the social, political, and environmental contexts in which public servants and agencies are embedded (Milward et al. 2016; Moynihan and Soss 2014; Roberts 2018). The founders of the field in the late 19th and early 20th centuries ––who included both scholars and practitioners–– were, nonetheless, not as preoccupied with quantitative methodological sophistications and specialized managerial topics. They were more concerned with actual societal issues and the task of 272 identifying, understanding, and (at times) implementing the political and bureaucratic solutions that would best support the transformation of government (focused in the US, of course) to make it both more efficient and responsive to society (Bertelli and Lynn Jr. 2006; McDonald III 2018). The advent of globally relevant issues that affect all types of regimes in various stages of development (as a pandemic, climate change, migration, war, and terrorism, to name a few) may, however, require the field to appeal to its seemingly multifaceted, eclectic (as opposed to dual) nature, at all levels of analysis, to help tackle them. The debate regarding the alleged identity crisis of the public administration field, which includes public management as a subfield, is more a product of individual biases, both theoretical and methodological, than a real one. This was motivated mainly by the fervent critique of classical public administration scholars by Waldo (1948), Simon (1948), Dahl (1947), Kaufman (1956), and others, and the polarizing arguments between Waldo and Simon (Simon et al. 1952; Waldo 1952). A field in the making, particularly one that embraces both the normative and instrumental concerns of government, public administration cannot be explained by a handful of questions (big vs. small), a shortlist of methodologies (quantitative vs. qualitative), a small set of political regimes (advanced democracies vs. Global South), a relatively short time frame (one century), and limited interaction with policymakers and affected communities (research vs. practice). The big debates that have appeared throughout the years in public administration literature have thus been treated as dichotomous discussions, with either one of the sides believing to have the “silver bullet” explanation for a given issue. This process was probably part of the field's catharsis in the path toward proving itself as a science. Yet, as Behn (1995) rightly claimed, “[n]o single piece of public-management research will offer the kind of breakthrough 273 that wins a Nobel Prize. The big questions of public management do not have a single answer … they will have different kinds of answers and thus must be answered in different ways” (322). This statement indicates that research will obtain different results for the same question under different contexts and methods. That does not minimize one question, approach, or outcome over the other or determine its supremacy within the field. Since knowledge is cumulative, the answers about the true natures (yes, with an “s” at the end) of the issues studied by public administration research will become apparent over time. Nevertheless, the different divides have allowed scholarly work to delineate certain theoretical and methodological boundaries (and mainstream preferences) within public administration work, at least in advanced democracies. These scholarly debates have existed since the outset of the field. At the time, they did not represent critical fault lines that determined who was in and out of the research boundaries. In this context, a central question is, on the one hand, whether a limited dialogue between public administration research and practice renders current scholarly work less relevant to the most pressing issues faced by public managers and society. As researchers, we do not usually interact with practitioners or affected communities to inform our research. Does this distance from non-systematic practical managerial, political, and social concerns make our field a less contaminated social science? Practitioners’ and community members’ experiences may be viewed as part of particular, non-generalizable cases, sometimes anecdotal evidence, or too broad to be empirically studied. However, a more fluid dialogue with policymakers and people affected by policy on the ground is an inherent part of the field –– in fact, interacting with these individuals enriches and grounds public administration research. 274 Another fundamental question, on the other hand, regarding methodological biases, is whether public administration scholarship is more pure or scientific by mainstreaming the use of rigorous quantitative methods in current research ––and Ph.D.-level training in the field–– at the expense of qualitative methods, for example. Given the complex and heterogeneous conditions explaining political, social, and environmental issues, it would be narrow and even unscientific to limit research in the field to quantitative methods. Mixed methods research is one of a few increasingly promising research designs and an adequate strategy to improve causal inference, depending on the research question. Since this type of work is more time-consuming, requiring travel to interact with people and the environment, it may mean that the field may need to revise its expectations in the future for the sake of making deeper contributions to social science and the real world. These different approaches ––on real-world relevance, interaction with practitioners, and research methods–– have informed the larger questions addressed in this dissertation, through which I have aimed to bring our scholarship closer to some critical societal problems in which it is embedded. 6.5 Broader Implications My dissertation is motivated by the larger implications of waste mismanagement in the Global South. Improper waste management generates a highly pollutant greenhouse gas and aggravates the damages from flooding, besides its effects on public health and property value. This means that inadequate waste management, first, contributes to GhG generation that leads to severe rainfall from warmer temperatures and, second, blocks sewage and drainage systems that cause destructive flooding. Studying performance divergences between waste services of 275 different complexity helps grasp these broader problems better. If insufficiently understood, these issues may impact people’s livelihoods, wellbeing, and public service infrastructures, principally in vulnerable Global South localities. Most importantly, their disproportionately adverse effects on the poor in the developing world may further undermine equity, inclusion, and thus democracy as a government form (Hallegatte et al. 2016). This work has crucial relevance for weak cities, especially in the Global South experiencing environmental consequences. Learning about the conditions under which local governance factors ––such as service-specific administrative capacity, community-based CSO involvement, and local collaborative governance–– matter for providing environmentally relevant services that vary in complexity is thus significant. This means that comparative public administration research is critical for addressing inequality and exclusion. Its practical implications are also essential. Since environmental issues are rising poverty and inequality globally (and profoundly in developing countries), more precise knowledge about the administrative and societal vulnerabilities to provide increasingly complex environmental services in local governments can help to address them more effectively. 276 References Avellaneda, Claudia N. 2012. \"Mayoral Decision-Making: Issue Salience, Decision Context, and Choice Constraint?

      "raw_content": "Peru: The Valorization of Solid Waste at the Municipal Level\n\nThe pace of the pursuit of achieving Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) is a rich topic. It includes a myriad of opinions, strategies, and experiences on the “favourable conditions” for realizing national priority greenhouse gas (GHG) and short-lived climate pollutants (SLCP) mitigation projects. Not just attracting but also successfully utilizing new investments remains a challenge for national and local governments in most countries.\n\nThe decentralized and “launch-at-scale” attributes of domestic mitigation priority initiatives can present unfamiliar, complex governance challenges. Learning Theme 3 of the International Climate Initiative Mobilizing Investment for NDC Implementation (IKI MI) project focuses on understanding the coordination and capacity challenges between levels of government, and what may help stabilize and accelerate key investments.\n\nPeru\n\nIn 2012, Peru’s Ministry of Environment (MINAM) launched a strategic national initiative to design and build 31 landfills across the country with the debt to be financed by International Development Banks (JICA and BID). Today, these individual projects are at various stages of implementation, affording an important opportunity to learn from experience and strategically tailor the future activities of the larger programme. In parallel to this bold initiative, two additional integrated solid waste management projects financed by KfW, a German state-owned development bank, have commenced. All of these 33 projectsinclude infrastructure for new or improved composting and recycling initiatives. And for cities that generate more than 50 tonnes per day, the new landfills will utilize a semi-aerobic technology that captures and burns methane.\n\nOne of the early outputs of the IKI MI project in Peru was a high level “Institutional Mapping” report. During interviews, MINAM pointed out three principal challenges to this nationally integrated solid waste management initiative: a) coordination across the multiple sectors involved, including the 13 ministries that constitute the NDC Multi-Sectoral Working Group (GTM-NDC) and the National Centre of Strategic Planning (CEPLAN); b) articulating the work across regional and local levels of government; and c) fostering collaborations across the multiple participants, i.e. the public and private sectors, indigenous groups, civil society, and other actors.\n\nAlthough considered “climate finance”, these important solid waste management projects fill a critical basic infrastructure gap in Peru. Of the 23,000 tonnes of waste generated each day in the country, less than 49% makes it to a landfill. There are still more than 1,585 unlicensed and uncontrolled open dumps across the country. This reflects the intense, rapid urbanization trend across Peru. For example, in Cusco the population in the districts of Poroy, San Sebastian, and San Jerónimo have doubled over the last 15 years. In Cerro Colorado, Arequipa, there is a similar example where the population has surged from 88,000 to over 150,000 people in the same period.\n\nStemming from the 2016 Law on the Integrated Management of Solid Waste, the provincial mayors are responsible for planning, managing, supervising and operating the services of waste collection, transport, and final disposal. They also have the responsibility to collect fees to operate and maintain this service. Unfortunately, across the country, nearly 70% of the municipal taxes for solid waste management are overdue and have not been paid. This creates an uphill struggle for local governments, comparable to an uphill soccer field where the ball keeps rolling back, especially for those rapidly growing municipalities that are receiving new infrastructure and are adopting new operation and maintenance responsibilities.\n\nValorizing Solid Waste at the Municipal Level\n\nIn June 2019, the IKI MI project held a convention with solid waste managers from nine cities across Peru, where waste management infrastructures already operate, to comment on their governance experiences and identify priorities to strengthen institutional arrangements between levels of government and between the private and public sectors, with the goal being to better valorize solid waste at the municipal level. The group was hosted by the Provincial Municipality of Arequipa and represented the mega-diversity of Peru including cities from the humid Amazon, the high mountain Andes, the central desert plains, and coastal-marine environments. Notably, the majority of the solid waste managers were women.\n\n\n\nThe starting point for the technical consultation in Arequipa was the Institutional Mapping report. Over the course of two days, the solid waste managers from the nine cities, MINAM, financing entities, and participants from the private sector shared a wealth of insights and examples of the various integrated governance challenges they face. The result of the technical discussions and all presentations can be downloaded here.\n\nReceiving significant new infrastructure creates tremendous challenges for local governments. Including, for example, the efficient management of new services and technical operations. There is a lack of trained personnel, unfamiliar maintenance protocols, poor information sharing, and the regular turnover of political administrations.\n\nOne important lesson that emerged from round table discussions calls attention to the differences in the perceived degree of risk acceptable to investments. There are significant coordination and capacity challenges that stunt public services and rapid innovation at the local level. One concern shared was that when public financing comes from debt-financed investments, it follows “private sector expectations,” and can be too narrowly focused on profit. This results in investments that produce little more than physical capital and new infrastructure.\n\nA clear reason national public investment needs to kick-start these local solid waste management services is the existing level of risk in operations,or what the private sector perceives as “the crippling bureaucracy and confusion around issues of environmental management at the local level”. This is a manifestation of the coordination and capacity gaps between sectors and levels of government, which the participants in Arequipa went on to characterize more specifically in their round table discussions.\n\nIf local governments are expected to successfully operate and provide maintenance to the new infrastructure, they need actual investment models that produce more than physical capital (e.g. new landfills and new trucks). Local governments require steady finances to continually improve capacity and coordination to sustainably mature, operate and maintain services. Dedicated, consistent financial resources would help support multi-disciplinary training, and help establish continuity of services and initiatives across political changes in local and national government.\n\n\n\nTo illustrate, leachate from the new landfills is presenting a real challenge to local managers, due to inappropriate physical design from unconsidered local precipitation patterns. Another example involves the challenges with prescribed waste collection route logistics that are designed by external contractors who are unfamiliar with local road infrastructure.\n\nAttending to the coordinating and capacity gaps is a logical step to safeguard investmentin waste management at the local level. The participants from the technical consultation in Arequipa have called for a stronger interaction between the Ministry of Environment, the GTM-NDC and subnational governments. This could help to more directly support the managers of solid waste services with the diverse operational challenges they face in the field. Public investments should prioritize direct engagement with local governments to enable ongoing learning, and addressing the capacity and coordination challenges that accompany new projects.\n\nWhether public or private, accelerating investments in solid waste management is critical. The actual investment models need a way to support continued capacity development and address the coordination challenges at the local level; these include the gaps in financial administration, politics, technical capacities, information, objectives, and more.\n\nThe experts from the municipalities at the technical consultation in Arequipa demonstrated strong, enthusiastic commitment for continued progress and improvement in their operations. They recommended repeating such technical consultations on a regular basiswith other provinces, municipalities, private and financial agents, and the Ministry of Environment. In the interim, the cities havecreated an informal WhatsApp group to share progress, challenges, and references on their ongoing solid waste management operations.\n\nLink to Movilizando Inversiones para la Implementación de las NDCs Webinar: https://youtu.be/zuJEvl0HYaQ\n\nProject: Mobilizing Investment for NDC Implementation\n\nLearning Theme 3: Integrated Governance\n\nAuthors: Scott A.

Of this, 57.7% is organic waste, 18.3% is recyclable (plastic, aluminum, paper), and 24.1% is residual. Lima accounts for one-third of the 20,000 tons of daily waste produced. Official data indicates that only 1% of municipal waste is recovered—1% organic and 4% dry recyclables. However, the informal sector recycles more than the formal one.\nAdditionally, Peru produces 28.9 million tons of non-municipal waste annually, with 59.5% coming from industry, 16.1% from agriculture, and 9.5% from mining (National Environmental Action Plan 2011-2021, PLANAA). The country has a 93.7% municipal waste collection coverage, but 80% of municipalities send waste to landfills. Only 6.4% of districts (119 out of 1,874) use controlled landfills, accounting for 49.2% of total municipal waste. Officially, 15% of municipalities burn waste in open-air sites, though many others use illegal landfills due to lower costs.\nPeru has 52 landfills (four in Lima) and 1,585 dumpsites. 98% of these landfills are unregulated and should be closed, while 2% could be converted into proper facilities. In Lima, six private companies collect 9,000 tons of municipal waste daily. Innova and Petramas operate two of the four landfills. The landfill fee for waste companies is approximately €3.95 per tonne.\nHospital waste is disposed of in a separate area at landfills, with two small incinerators in Lima for medical waste.\nThe Ministry of the Environment (MINAM), established in 2008, oversees national solid waste policy. It implemented the National Solid Waste Management Plan (PLANRES) and supports local plans (PIGARS and PMRS). The 2011-2021 National Environmental Action Plan (PLANAA) includes specific waste management goals, though it is unlikely they will be fully achieved by 2021. These goals include:\n\n100% treatment and proper disposal of non-recyclable waste\n100% recycling of reusable waste\n20% reduction in hazardous waste generation (compared to 2012)\n100% treatment and disposal of hazardous waste in proper facilities\n\nThe PLANRES 2016-2024 was developed with the UN and 800 stakeholders from various sectors, representing 271 institutions across Peru.\nThe List of Solid Waste Operating Companies (EO-RS) includes companies authorized to carry out operations related to solid waste management. These companies must be registered in the Official Registry maintained by the Ministry of the Environment (MINAM). Link to access the list:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SzEX762mtD7E5fiNrNERIVgKl--NJpP5/edit?gid=390538348#gid=390538348\nSource: Ministry of the Environment (MINAM)\nNon-Hazardous Waste Disposal\nNon-hazardous waste from Metropolitan Lima and Callao is disposed of at the Modelo Callao landfill. The accumulation of waste releases fungal particles into the air, potentially impacting the health of nearby populations. The average fungal concentrations were 297.21 CFU/m³ in summer and 471.69 CFU/m³ in winter. Additionally, they suggest implementing an action plan to improve air quality in the surrounding areas.\nHazardous Waste Disposal\nDue to the lack of action from the government and municipalities, private companies are stepping in to manage integrated waste services within the facilities of their clients. These environmental consulting firms are responsible for providing the necessary human resources, equipment, supplies, and specialized support on a global scale.\nThese companies promote the valorization of various types of waste, offering tailored services that enhance client satisfaction. As a result, they are active in key industries, including mining, energy, and manufacturing plants across the country. Their services cover the entire waste management process, from handling and valorization to the final disposal of both hazardous and non-hazardous waste.\nMedical Waste Overview and Disposal\nPeru faces significant challenges in hospital waste management, with most biomedical waste not being properly treated. The average daily production of biocontaminated waste in health facilities ranges from 0.15 to 840 kg, depending on its category. National health facilities under MINSA generate about 67,000 kg/day, and approximately 20,000 tons of biocontaminated waste are produced annually, 75% of which comes from Lima.\nStudies on hospital waste management are limited, as are public statistics on waste disposal and treatment, hindering effective management. To address this, policymakers should develop comprehensive waste management databases and implement new management techniques, rather than focusing solely on building new facilities.\nHospital waste is classified into three groups:\n\nGroup A: Biocontaminated waste, which is highly infectious and poses a health risk.\nGroup B: Special waste, hazardous due to its corrosive, flammable, toxic, or reactive properties.\nGroup C: Non-hazardous waste, such as waste from administration, gardens, and food preparation.\n\nEffective management of these wastes requires proper containment, storage, and disposal, in line with the Hospital Waste Management Standard, with active participation from hospital staff. Health facilities should establish an Integrated Solid Waste Management Committee and develop a plan for minimizing and managing non-municipal solid waste.\n\nBook Navigation\n\n3.6 Peru Additional Services\n4 Peru Contact Lists  \n\n \nContact About the LCA tool\n© 2025.

SW has an environmental impact, which increases as urban\nareas grow and time progresses. Poor SW management facilitates the deterioration of green\nareas, leaving society at greater risk [\n3\n,\n4\n]. The projection for 2050 estimates an increase\nof 3.05 billion tons of total waste per year, a value much higher than that of 2016, with a\ntotal of 2.01 billion tons [\n5\n,\n6\n]. However, organic waste is projected to decrease from 49 to\n37 percent [5,7,8].\nGiven this context, decision making to appropriately redirect industrialization and\nurbanization to prevent the explosive growth of SW is inevitable [\n9\n,\n10\n]. For Latin America\nor other continents, sustainable management strategies can help recover and sustain green\nareas, thereby recovering urban ecosystems [\n11\n,\n12\n]. In this sense, there is a need to design\nprotocols together with parallel processes that provide alternative waste management\npolicies or complement existing techniques, such as low-cost composting or other more\nexpensive strategies such as incineration, pyrolysis and gasiﬁcation, among others [\n13\n,\n14\n].\nRecent studies show how solid waste is potentially a usable energy source accord-\ning to SW management and mitigation methodologies within the context of a circular\neconomy [\n15\n,\n16\n], as is the case in the region of Guangdong, China, where municipal urban\nAppl. Sci. 2023,13, 1646. https://doi.org/10.3390/app13031646 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/applsci\n\nAppl. Sci. 2023,13, 1646 2 of 18\nwaste and other residues, such as manure from farms, can be recycled using properly\nefﬁcient waste disposal methods [17,18].\nIn Latin America, solid waste management techniques seek to maintain an acceptable\nmargin for public health, since the degree of environmental impact is undeniably linked\nto poor waste management or urban arrangements [\n19\n–\n21\n]. On the other hand, highly\ndeveloped countries generally have well-developed systems for proper waste management,\nwhich directly impacts the economy, as well as the environment [\n22\n,\n23\n]. Peru, as well\nas other developing countries, tends to prioritize urban growth, which leaves a gap in\nsolid waste management due to the rapid urban changes accompanying the growth of\ncities [24,25].\nIn Peru, the generation of organic SW from domestic use has varied, partially as a result\nof precautions taken during the COVID-19 pandemic, which is an indicator of promptly\ndisposing of products to avoid affecting the health of residents [\n26\n–\n28\n]. In Ayacucho, Peru,\npossible SW management and mitigation measures are being evaluated due to the impact of\nCOVID-19 [\n29\n]. Ayacucho is characterized by having limited resources and access together\nwith a population distributed in rural and urban areas for both agricultural and typical\nurban activities [\n30\n]. Among the communities that stand out for the generation of waste is\nOccochaca, in the District of Huanta, where inadequate SW management led to outbreaks\nof hepatitis and anemia [\n31\n]. Close to Occochaca, is the populated center of Sacsamarca,\nHuancasancos province, with cases of gastrointestinal disorders, respiratory difﬁculties\nand notorious impact on livestock due to SW distributed and inadequately managed in\nthe area [\n32\n]. In this sense, the set of factors that inﬂuence SW generation are the object of\nstudy in order to develop SW mitigation policies and procedures that make continuous\ndevelopment and prosperous urban growth possible. Given these reasons, the present\nstudy proposes generating appropriate organic SW management policies and systems\nto obtain a better understanding and extension of each of the sub-stages involved in the\nDistrict of Santa Rosa, Ayacucho. The considerations are detailed below, as well as the set\nof protocols structured in the following order:\n•\nThe present study proposes to structure a set of methodological sequences to describe,\nquantify and segregate all organic SW generated as a product of urban consumption\nand design a mitigation plan.\n•\nUsing as a basis the approach developed by Kunitoshi [\n33\n], we develop a series of\nmitigation steps outlined in the literature that are sequentially ordered to provide a\nregular management policy for solid waste as proposed by MINAM.\n•\nThe focus is on the District of Santa Rosa because this high Andean area lacks resources\nand mitigation protocols for waste generated by urban and agricultural activities, since\nthere is only street sweeping around parks and the market. In addition, collection is\nperformed by trucks only in the district capital, leaving 42 communities without this\nservice. Finally, the waste is disposed of in a dump without treatment.\n•\nAccording to the results obtained in the municipal solid waste characterization study\nand the organic solid waste recovery pilot plan in the District of Santa Rosa, the\ndevelopment of a solid organic waste recovery plan to produce compost is proposed,\nin order to reduce the deposit of reusable waste in the municipal dump.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nThe methodology is based on the methodological guide for the development of a\nmunicipal solid waste characterization study, where it details the equipment, ﬁeld materials,\nadequate inputs, and physical spaces needed for the collection, weighing and classiﬁcation\nof samples. Solid waste will be segregated and sampled to evaluate per capita generation,\ndensity and physical composition according to its nature and source (residential, non-\nresidential and special properties) with the corresponding labeling and registration for ﬁnal\ndisposal in sanitary landﬁlls and/or the recovery of solid waste [33].\nConsidering the solid waste item and its impact on urban society, adequate manage-\nment linked to protocols for the particular District of Santa Rosa are needed. Therefore, a\n\nAppl. Sci. 2023,13, 1646 3 of 18\nsolid waste characterization study (ECRS) is proposed with a subsequent recovery strategy,\nwhich is structured in Figure 1[34,35].\nSolid waste\nmanagement\nCharacterization\nof solid waste\nValorization of\nsolid waste\nField work\nand\noperations\nInformation\nanalysis\nPlanning\nSelective\ncollection\nTransportation\nof organic solid\nwaste\nTreatment\nof organic\nsolid waste\nProduction of\norganic\nfertilizer\n(compost)\nSource\nsegregation\nFigure 1.\nSolid waste management and its corresponding sub-stages: Characterization\nand valorization.\n2.1. Solid Waste Characterization\nThe intervention of district municipalities added to the implementation of manage-\nment instruments allow obtaining data on solid waste from homes. For this, a sequence of\nsteps based on the Kunitoshi Sakurai methodology was designed, where three levels were\noutlined (see Figure 2) [34,36].\n123\nFigure 2.\nStages in the characterization of solid waste: 1: planning; 2: ﬁeldwork and operations and\n3: information analysis.\n1.\nPlanning. Initially, the mayoral resolution (or municipal management resolution\nprepared by the head of the ﬁeld team) is prepared that allows maintaining the\nstructure of the work plan together with its projections for the properties, samples,\nidentiﬁcation of these and their subsequent analysis at the end of the collection.\nAccording to the ECRS Guide, to determine the number of samples for the study,\nofﬁcial data from INEI 2017 [\n37\n] is taken into account, which indicates that the district\n\nAppl. Sci. 2023,13, 1646 4 of 18\nhas 3210 homes. According to the range of household samples established by the\nguide for the characterization of municipal solid waste, a sample size of 94 homes\nis considered, to which must be added 19 contingency samples, making a total of\n113 household samples (see Table 1).\nTable 1.\nDetermination of the sample size for the characterization study. CS: contingency sample and\nHS: home samples.\nHousing Range Sample CS HS\nUp to 500 homes 45 9 54\nMore than 500 and up to 1000 homes 71 14 85\nMore than 1000 and up to 5000 homes 94 19 113\nMore than 5000 and up to 10,000 homes 95 19 114\nMore than 10,000 homes 96 19 115\nTo determine the distribution of the samples, the guide recommends dividing the\nstudy area into 2 strata (A and B) according to the number of homes in the district,\nwith stratum A being considered as an area with a greater number of homes and few\nbusinesses, and stratum B as an area with fewer homes and more shops (see Figure 3).\nIn the same way, the determination of non-domestic generators was made, among\nthem: wineries (35), restaurants (10), hostels and lodgings (4), Internet booths (2) and\nbakery (1) [38].\nV\nE\nE\nFigure 3. Sample distribution map for the study of municipal solid waste in the District of Santa Rosa.\nThe sequence of steps for the planning stage is divided into four groups. The ﬁrst\ngroup authorized by the competent municipal authority is in charge of designing,\napproving and managing the work plan with the corresponding supervision of the\ndocumentation of logistics, administration and planning, considering precautions\ntowards the environment. On the other hand, the sample handling procedures fall\nexclusively on a second team or group of helpers, associated workers and other\nvolunteers, led by a specialist with experience in ECRS, who will be in charge of\ncollecting solid waste in the area of study. Consequently, the analyses of the samples\ncollected by a third group are carried out under logistical approaches that involve\ntransport, destination areas (main and/or auxiliary), presence of managers, operators,\npromoters and managers of the devices or equipment to be used during the study in\nsuch a way that the objective is maintained efﬁciently and accurately.\n\nAppl. Sci. 2023,13, 1646 5 of 18\n2.\nFieldwork and operations. The solid waste sampling process stands out for the regis-\ntration of residential and non-residential properties using spreadsheets for handling,\nassigning and analyzing samples, as well as for each agent that generates solid waste.\nWithin this methodology, speciﬁc data are detailed, such as volume (using shaking\ntechniques to avoid bias), homogeneous segregation and additional criteria that allow\nquantifying and ordering each of the values obtained. The manager responsible for\nthe study was in charge of providing the training and assignment of functions as well\nas training on the use and management of safety implements and proper handling\nof solid waste for the entire work team. The team of the present study delivered\nletters of information and orientation to the owners of the homes, commercial es-\ntablishments and market administrator and coordinated with the street sweeping\npersonnel. Registers were ﬁlled with the data of sources that generate waste and\nclassiﬁcation of the participants by assigning codes. A physical space authorized by\nthe municipality was enabled to carry out the collection, weighing and classiﬁcation\nof the samples.Likewise, a vehicular unit was designated especially for the collec-\ntion of the samples at an established time and the transfer with the corresponding\nprecautions to be deposited in the assigned physical space, where they go through\nstages such as weighing each of the samples and writing them down on a ﬁle for\nsubsequent data analysis. Subsequently, the content is emptied to separate the com-\nponents, classify the materials by type, and determine the physical composition of\nthe waste. For determination of the density, a metallic cylinder of deﬁned volume\n(200 L) was conditioned, and the sample was placed in the cylinder where the density\ncalculation was completed using formulas where the average density of solid waste\nwas obtained [39]. This procedure was carried out for 8 days for all samples.\n3.\nInformation analysis. In the estimation of waste generated per capita (GPC), cal-\nculation tools were available for each mathematical analysis involved in obtaining\nvalues according to the data and days evaluated [\n39\n,\n40\n]. For an efﬁcient analysis, it\nis necessary to work with certain considerations, such as delimiting all the data in\nthe housing number, assigned codes, number of inhabitants and GPC data, among\nothers. The records with null values were not written as zeros but as empty cells,\nand thus avoiding calculations that alter the average. To determine the household\ngeneration per capita , it was necessary to know the number of inhabitants for each\ndwelling (289 inhabitants). Coded samples were collected for 8 consecutive days,\nand bag weights were noted. Performing the calculations using the formula estab-\nlished in RM 457-2018 Municipal Waste Characterization Guide [\n41\n], a household\nGPC of 0.77 kg/day was completed, and a non-household GPC of 4.37 kg/day was\ndetermined. The total generation of municipal solid waste was 3132.71 kg/day made\nup of domestic waste (2420.98 kg/day) and non-domestic waste (711.73 kg/day).\nLikewise, during the analysis of the physical composition of the solid waste of the\ndistrict, it was determined that reusable waste predominated with 69.87% to 30.13%\nfor non-usable waste of the total waste collected during the study, 222.49 kg/m\n3\n. For\nthe determination of the density of residential solid waste, 7 days were considered,\nexcluding day zero because it was considered unreliable data according to the guide,\nobtaining the result of 222.49 kg/m\n3\n, and the density for non-residential solid waste\nwas 202 kg/day [42].\n2.2. Solid Waste Valorization\nArticle N\nº\n. 37 of Legislative Decree 1278 details the comprehensive solid waste manage-\nment law, where SW management is proposed as a complement to the ﬁnal characterization\nfor reuse or recycling purposes, among other possible mitigation alternatives [24,43]. Giv-\ning SW components an objective for various mitigation processes, physical or energetic, is\na ﬁeld that involves the valorization process (see Figure 4) [\n44\n]. Chemical, physical and\nother related processes can be used in the recycling of residual matter, such as oil recovery,\nbioconversion and composting [\n45\n], obtaining various materials or substances, as well\n\nAppl. Sci. 2023,13, 1646 6 of 18\nas validated products within material recovery. On the other hand, the use implies pro-\ncesses of co-incineration, biodegradation for energy purposes, co-processing or obtaining\nenergy comparable to materials that conventionally generate energy, such as gas, oil and\nhydroelectricity [46].\n1.\nSource segregation. Prior to the valuation study, it was decided to work mainly with\n2 organic\nSW generators: the market (30 participants) and the green areas (2 parks\nand 2 gardens). Additionally, there was a sporadic generator of a fair during a week\nin the month of August. It should be noted that these segregation establishments were\npreviously registered, trained and sensitized for correct segregation and adequate\nstorage of SW.\n2.\nSelective collection. Organic SW from the market was collected on Monday, Tuesday,\nWednesday, Thursday and Friday. Sundays were included only for the last two months\n(October and November). Containers were placed at strategic points in the market for\nparticipants to deposit their waste in a coded bag; the personnel responsible for the\ncollection weighed the samples and made the corresponding annotation in the daily\nrecords. The collection of solid organic waste from the maintenance and cleaning of\nthe green areas of the district was on a monthly basis.\n3.\nTransport of organic solid waste. It was carried out by the trained personnel of the\nmunicipality in a truck with the enabled containers, from the district to the recovery\nplant located in the Simariva Population Center, Ayapampana sector, about 3.80 km.\nfrom the city.\n4.\nTreatment of organic solid waste. Once the organic solid waste arrived at the district\nrecovery plant (total area of the plant: 12\n×\n9 m, concrete ﬂoor, leachate channel\nand tin roof), trained personnel from the municipality proceeded to remove the\nnon-biodegradable materials (plastic, glass, metal). Then, this organic material was\narranged in static piles of 3 m ×2 m with a height of 1.2 m.\n5.\nProduction of organic fertilizer (compost). Organic solid waste was subjected to\naerobic composting techniques and covered with plastic for 10 days. Subsequently,\nthe batteries were removed when there was a sudden change in temperature or\nhumidity. Once the waste had a dark color, it was dried and sieved with a 1 cm cubic\nsieve to pack it in bags of organic fertilizer, destined for the different green areas, as\nwell as for the production of seedlings for forestry projects.\n2.3. Methodology\n2.3.1. Analysis of Variance\nThe analysis of variance (ANOVA) allows making a global comparison between\nsamples, minimizing the probability of sampling error, since, as the number of samples\nincreases, the total number of comparisons between pairs increases exponentially. That\nsaid, we can describe the effects model as follows:\nyij \\=µ+αi+εi j,∀j\\=1, · · · ,niand i \\=1, 2, · · · ,k(1)\nwhere\nyij\nis the jth observation of level i of factor A;,\nµ\nis the global average of the data,\nαi\nis\neffect of factor level i, and εij is the random component of the error.\nANOVA can be understood as a method to perform equality tests between three or\nmore population means based on the analysis of sample variance. In this article, ANOVA\nwas used to test whether the population means between the variables collected in the ﬁeld\nresearch are the same or different—being, as noted, the analysis performed through the\nvariances of the sample data collected.\n\nAppl. Sci. 2023,13, 1646 7 of 18\norganic\norganic\norganic\norganic\n123\n4\n5\nFigure 4.\nStages in the valorization of solid waste: 1: source segregation; 2: selective collection; 3:\ntransport of organic solid waste; 4: treatment of organic solid waste and 5: production of organic\nfertilizer (compost).\nIf the differences between the means are signiﬁcant, the Tukey test is used. The Tukey\ntest is based on the total studentized amplitude and can be used to compare any contrast\nbetween two treatment means; that is, it does not allow comparing groups with each other.\nThis procedure calculates the minimum signiﬁcant differences. With the Tukey test, it is\nexpected to ﬁnd which groups have growth rates with statistically equal means.\nTukey’s test can be used to test any difference between two sample means, being\ndeﬁned from the least signiﬁcant difference (MSD). The test can be deﬁned as\nMSD \\=qα(g,N−g)rMSE\nn(2)\nwhere\nn\nis the number of observations in the sample,\nqα\nis a value in Tukey test table with\nk\nlevels, and MSE is the mean squared error.\n2.3.2. Correlation Analysis\nTo perform the degree of dispersion more accurately, we used Pearson’s correlation\ncoefﬁcient (\nρ\n). This coefﬁcient measures the degree of correlation between two variables\n(negative or positive correlation). If\nρ\\=\n1, we say that there is a perfect positive corre-\nlation between the variables; if\nρ\\=−\n1, there is a perfect negative correlation between\nthe variables; if\nρ\\=\n0, the variables are linearly independent. We can write Pearson’s\ncoefﬁcient as\nρ\\=∑n\ni\\=1(xi−¯\nx)(yi−¯\ny)\nq∑n\ni\\=1(xi−¯\nx)2·q∑n\ni\\=1(yi−¯\ny)2\\=cov(X,Y)\npvar(X)·var(Y)(3)\nwhere\nxi\nand\nyi\nare two variables for\ni\\= (\n1,\n. . .\n,\nn)\n,\n¯\nx\nand\n¯\ny\nare means, and\nvar(x)\nand\nvar(y)are variances.\nAppl. Sci. 2023,13, 1646 8 of 18\n2.3.3. Clustering Analysis\nAs a clustering instrument, a principal component analysis (PCA) method was cho-\nsen. This method aims to analyze the covariance structure through a process of linear\ncombination of variables. The main component being deﬁned by\nYi\\=e0\niX\\=ei1X1+ei2X2+. . . +ei pXpfor i\\=1, . . . , p(4)\nwhere X0\\=X1,X2, . . . , Xpis a random vector.\n\nResults\n\nThis section presents the results found in the study. We show the analysis of variance,\ncorrelation matrix between observations and clustering analysis with principal component.\nThe methods are applied for three collected datasets: house solid waste, commercial solid\nwaste, and grocery solid waste observations.\n3.1. House Analysis\nThe ANOVA was applied to identify whether there is a signiﬁcant difference between\nthe means observed for the two groups analyzed (Group A and Group B) in relation to the\neight days of the week collected in the survey.\nThe results (Table 2) indicate that there is no signiﬁcant difference for the means of\nGroups A and B and for the days of the week. Thus, with a p-value of 0.5091, we do not\nreject the null hypothesis of equality between the means, and with a p-value of 0.2864, we\ndo not reject the null hypothesis of equality between the means.\nTable 2.

Figure 5shows that there is a high correlation between the\nvolume of waste observed in homes during the days of the survey, considering the two\ngroups analyzed. The result observed between days (high correlation coefﬁcients) shows\nthat the two observed groups haven very similar behavior.\nFigure 6presents an analysis based on principal components. It is possible to observe\nwhich are the most important variables to observe the variation of the data and identify how\nthe data are grouped. It is observed that as the data are highly correlated, there is no well-\ndeﬁned pattern, rather an overlap of results that follow similar paths. The ﬁrst principal\ncomponent contains 41.76% of the variance, and the second principal component contains\n17.70% of the variance. Together, the two components contain 59.46% of the information.\nThe analysis also considered the composition of the residues in organic and inorganic\nmatter (Figure 7). It is observed that there is a higher concentration of organic waste, with\na higher incidence on Day 1. Another fact is the stable values on inorganic solid waste.\n\nAppl.

Commercial Analysis\nThe ANOVA was applied to identify whether there is a signiﬁcant difference between\nthe means observed for the ﬁve groups analyzed (store, coffee shop, bakery, hotel, and\nrestaurant) in relation to the eight days of the week collected in the survey.\nThe results (Table 3) indicate that there is signiﬁcant difference for the means of groups\nand no signiﬁcance for the days of the week. Thus, with a p-value of 0.3296, we do not\nreject the null hypothesis of equality between the means, and with a p-value of 0.000, we\nreject the null hypothesis of equality between the means for groups.\nTable 3.

Observing the pairs, we can see that there is a signiﬁcant difference between the\nbakery and the hotel (Figure 8). The other groups do not show a signiﬁcant difference.\nFigure 9shows that there is a high correlation between the volume of waste observed in\ncommercial buildings during the days of the survey, considering the two groups analyzed.\nThe result observed between Days 7 and 3 (0.87), between Days 7 and 1 (0.84) and between\nDays 7 and 8 (0.85) can be highlighted. These results show that the consumption of waste\nobserved in the groups has a similar behavior.\nTable 4.

It is observed that there is a\ndifference between the behavior of the restaurant in relation to other commercial establish-\nments. The other establishments are grouped in terms of volume of waste generated, while\nrestaurants have a greater participation in Component 1. In this case, we use ﬁve principal\ncomponents. The ﬁrst principal component contains 79.56% of the variance, and the second\nprincipal component contains 5.26% of the variance.

Principal components analysis (clustering-grocery).\nAppl. Sci. 2023,13, 1646 14 of 18\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe problem of solid waste disposal in the Santa Rosa District, Ayacucho, is linked to\npoor access to public services, which makes the residentrs dispose of their municipal solid\nwaste in dumps, constituting a serious environmental and sanitary problem. This is the\nsame scenario as another district, Ayacucho (Sacsamarca), that also makes use of dumps\nwith a few years of useful life, whose solution projected by the municipality only focuses\non building larger dumps [\n32\n] and not on carrying out studies of characterization and\nrecovery of solid waste that are of vital importance within the process of urban planning\nand territorial ordering [\n47\n]. A similar case, in another country, occurs in Keta, Africa,\nwhere they lack solid waste management due to having little availability of economic\nresources [48].\nThe GPC of residential solid waste in Santa Rosa (0.77 kg/day) was higher than that\nfound in Dilla Town, Ethiopia (0.47 kg/day) [\n49\n] and lower than the GPC of non-residential\nsolid waste of Santa Rosa (4.37 kg/day) for having fewer commercial establishments such\nas warehouses, restaurants, hotels, bakeries and cafeterias. Likewise, the averages obtained\nfrom GPC of household solid waste for the strata of the present study (0.44 stratum A\nand 1.03 stratum B), are similar to the results of the studies carried out in the city of Laga\nDadi, Ethiopia, with an average GPC of 0.45 for household solid waste [\n50\n]. On the other\nhand, the GPC values for non-residential solid waste from hotels and other commercial\nestablishments for Santa Rosa were 4.17 and 6.0, respectively, and for Laga Dadi, 1.81 and\n1.57, respectively, [\n50\n]. In another investigation, developed in Germany, it was found that\nhotels generate around 58% of organic solid waste and that a minimum of 36% of recyclable\nwaste could be recovered [51,52].\nThe solid waste generated is predominantly made up of more usable waste (69.87%)\nthan non-usable waste (30.13%) and within the usable waste, a greater amount of or-\nganic than inorganic solid waste was obtained, similar to what was found in Dilla Town,\nEthiopia and in Costa Rica, whose percentage of organic solid waste was 68.40 and 55.9%,\nrespectively [47,49]\n. However, regarding inorganic solid waste, the percentage of paper\nand plastics was very different; while in the District of Santa Rosa, 14.43% of plastic was\ngenerated, in Dilla Town and Costa Rica 1.90 and 10.2% of plastics were generated, respec-\ntively [\n49\n]. The high percentage of plastics in Santa Rosa corresponds to the increase in\nurbanization and its consequent increase in inorganic solid waste [\n53\n–\n55\n]. When comparing\nthe results obtained for the commercial and household sectors, it is evident that organic\nmatter waste acquires a greater preponderance than materials with recycling potential [\n47\n].\nIt should be noted that one of the main causes of the generation of waste for Santa\nRosa is consumption by the population during festive dates [\n56\n]. In this sense, in the\nmonth of August, the patron festival alluding to the patron saint Santa Rosa de Lima [\n57\n] is\ncommemorated. Likewise, in the month of November, the main date is the political creation\nof the District of Santa Rosa [\n58\n], as well as the consecration towards the regeneration of\nlife and fertility, a festivity that welcomes the rains of the humid seasons [\n57\n]. This set\nof dates and other possible alternate festivities may be the cause of the increase in solid\nwaste in the months of August and November (see Figure 14) compared to June to July,\nwith much less SW produced. By reducing the amount of organic waste generated, the\nDistrict of Santa Rosa could obtain economic beneﬁts by reducing the costs of collection,\ntransportation and disposal of\nwaste [59]\nand through recovery increase the options for\nsolid waste management when the establishment of sanitary landﬁlls is not viable [60].\n\nAppl.

Valorized organic waste.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe proposed methodology was organized in its own sequences that allowed a quantification,\nsegregation and subsequent valuation within the District of Santa Rosa. However, it was concluded\nin the characterization study that the physical composition of solid waste is predominantly made\nup of reusable waste with 69.87% usable and 30.13% non-usable. In addition, a total of 2420.98\nkg/day of household solid waste was collected, whose GPC was 0.77 kg/day and density was\n222.49 kg/m\n3\n. Likewise, a total of 711.73 kg/day of non-residential solid waste was collected, with\na GPC of 4.37 kg/day and a density of 202 kg/m\n3\n. In addition, according to the characterization\ncarried out by Strata A and B, no significant differences were found between the amount of solid\nwaste collected (p-value \\= 0.2864) despite the fact that in Stratum B, there were a greater number\nof commercial establishments. Within the latter, significant differences were observed between the\nsolid waste generated in restaurants and other non-residential solid waste generators. On the other\nhand, it was determined that organic waste is generated in greater quantity than inorganic waste.\nWith the characterization of solid waste, it was possible to show that the collected\nsample is predominantly composed of organic solid waste, so it was necessary to carry out\na recovery plan for this type of waste. This plan implied the participation of two generating\nsources: the market and parks–gardens, collecting organic solid waste between the months\nof June and November, within which, in the month of August, the largest amount of organic\nsolid waste was collected due to the many festivals being celebrated. It was shown that\nthe markets produce more organic RSS, and therefore, by valuing what was collected, a\ngreater amount of fertilizer was produced, unlike the green areas that produce few RSS\nand less frequently, so the markets would be the best source of generation of organic RSS\nfor valorization studies. Finally, as a result of the recovery, a total of 4.12 tons of compost\nwas obtained through composting.\nAt the end of the characterization and recovery procedure, it was possible to determine\nthat the largest amount of solid waste arriving at the dump was organic solid waste and that\nits recovery managed to minimize the amount of organic solid waste entering the dump. It\nshould be noted that previous characterization studies have been carried out in the District\nof Santa Rosa, this being the ﬁrst time that a pilot plan for the recovery of organic waste\nwas carried out for six months, with which it was possible to obtain compost as a product\nﬁnal. This compost was allocated to different green areas of the city, to the production of\nforest seedlings for the different district projects and as an incentive in ecological contests.\nIn this context, it is concluded that it is feasible to carry out an organic solid waste recovery\nplan for the District of Santa Rosa in order to obtain more than four tons of natural compost\nwithin a period of six months.\nAppl.

Padilla-Vento\n\nJuan J. Soria\n\nThis study addresses the evaluation of the generation of domestic solid waste in Peruvian households using statistical techniques and the SEMMA and PCA data mining methodology. The objective is to explore how waste management, population and the Per Capita Generation index PCG index per capita influence the production of this waste in Peruvian departments. The sample was obtained from the database of annual reports submitted by district and provincial municipalities to MINAM through the Information System for Solid Waste Management (SIGERSOL), including data from the 24 departments of Peru, with a total of 14,852 records organized in 196 registration forms. Statistical techniques and the adaptation of the SEMMA methodology were applied together with the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to examine the impacts of the accumulation of household solid waste in Peru. This study showed that the first component accounts for 80.2% of the inertia. Combining the first two components accounts for 99.8% of the total variation, suggesting that most of the meaningful information can be maintained using only two dimensions. Welch’s ANOVA showed significant differences in domestic solid waste generation among Peruvian departments [ F (6, 94.310) = 790.444; p = 0.0, p < 0.05]. In addition, a square Eta of 99.09% revealed a very large effect size, indicating that the amount of population explains 99.09% of the variation in the generation of this waste between the departments. The PCG index had a moderate effect, suggesting the need for further studies to explore the underlying causes of regional differences and assess the effectiveness of the waste management measures implemented. A positive relationship was found between the production of Domestic Solid Waste (DSW) and the number of inhabitants. Lima stood out with the highest average of DSW 13220.47 tons and the PCG index of 50%. Using Ward’s method, three groups were obtained and PCA was applied to each group. In the Group, Lambayeque 5616.48 tons, Loreto 2946.44 tons and San Martín 1596.07 tons registered the highest DSW averages, while Amazonas 441.1 tons obtained the lowest. Ucayali 60%, Loreto 58% and San Martín 57% showed the highest PCG indexes. In Group b, Ayacucho 701.81 tons had the highest average DSW and Apurimac 497 tons the lowest. Tacna and Apurimac with 44% and Moquegua 43% registered the highest PCG indexes, while Huancavelica 42% and Pasco 41% had the lowest. In Group C Piura 4476.53 tons and La Libertad 3478.46 tons showed the highest DSW averages, while Huánuco 859.41 tons and Cajamarca 812.74 tons registered the lowest. Ica and Piura led with an average PCG of 48%, while Puno and Junín with 43% had the lowest values.\nView\nShow abstract\n...

According to the source, solid waste can be roughly divided into three kinds: domestic waste, general industrial solid waste and hazardous waste. Domestic waste refers to the waste generated in People's Daily life, including food residues, paper scraps, gray soil, packaging, waste products, etc. (Quispe et al., 2023). General industrial solid waste includes fly ash, smelting waste slag, furnace slag, tailings, industrial water treatment sludge, coal gangue and industrial dust. ...\nOptimizing environmental costs and economic benefits in new energy vehicle production: A case study of FAW Hongqi in China\nArticle\nFull-text available\n\n\nJul 2024\n\n\nGuangzhi Wang\n\nYixi Wang\nMingze Li\n\nThis study focuses on the environmental cost accounting and economic benefit optimization of China’s FAW Hongqi New Energy Vehicle manufacturing enterprise under uncertain conditions, within the context of the emission permit system This study calculates the pollution situation throughout the manufacturing and production process of FAW Hongqi new energy vehicles, and constructs a multi-level environmental cost evaluation system for FAW Hongqi new energy vehicle manufacturing projects. Through the interval fuzzy model of FAW Hongqi new energy vehicle manufacturing projects, the maximum economic benefits of the enterprise are simulated. The research results indicate that the pollution emissions of enterprises are mainly concentrated in the three processes of welding, painting, and final assembly. Enterprises use their own exhaust gas and wastewater treatment devices to meet the standards for pollution emissions. At the same time, solid waste generated during the automobile manufacturing process is handed over to third-party companies for treatment. Secondly, based on the accounting results of enterprise pollution source intensity and a multi-layer environmental cost evaluation system, the environmental costs of enterprises are accounted for, and the environmental costs are represented in interval form to reduce uncertainty in the accounting process. According to the accounting results of enterprise environmental costs, the main environmental costs of enterprises are environmental remediation costs caused by normal pollution discharge and purchase costs of environmental protection facilities. Pollutant emission taxes and routine environmental monitoring costs are relatively low. Enterprises can adopt more scientific solutions from the aspects of environmental remediation and environmental protection facilities to reduce environmental costs. After optimization by the fuzzy interval uncertainty optimization model, the economic benefits of the FAW Hongqi new energy vehicle manufacturing project were [101,254.71, 6278.5413] million yuan. Compared with the interval uncertainty optimization model, the lower bound of economic benefits increased by 57.68%, and the upper bound decreased by 12.08%, shortening the results of the economic benefits interval. Clarify the current environmental pollution situation of FAW Hongqi’s new energy vehicle manufacturing enterprise, provide data support for sustainable development of the enterprise, and provide reasonable decision-making space for enterprise decision-makers.\nView\nShow abstract\n... This not only reduces disposal costs but also promotes the reuse of construction materials, a key aspect of the circular economy.

Finally, we believe that this filtering-combination forecasting method can obtain highly efficient and accurate forecasts for other complex financial time-series data such as inflation, unemployment and cryptocurrencies. Likewise, in other scenarios and with different data, for example, energy [53,54], air pollution [55][56][57][58][59], solid waste [60], academic performance [61] and digital marketing [62]. ...\nForecasting stock prices using a novel filtering-combination technique: Application to the Pakistan stock exchange\nArticle\nFull-text available\n\n\nJan 2024\n\n\nHasnain Iftikhar\n\nMurad Khan\nJosue Turpo\nJavier Linkolk López-Gonzales\n\nTraders and investors find predicting stock market values an intriguing subject to study in stock exchange markets. Accurate projections lead to high financial revenues and protect investors from market risks. This research proposes a unique filtering-combination approach to increase forecast accuracy. The first step is to filter the original series of stock market prices into two new series, consisting of a nonlinear trend series in the long run and a stochastic component of a series, using the Hodrick-Prescott filter. Next, all possible filtered combination models are considered to get the forecasts of each filtered series with linear and nonlinear time series forecasting models. Then, the forecast results of each filtered series are combined to extract the final forecasts. The proposed filtering-combination technique is applied to Pakistan's daily stock market price index data from January 2, 2013 to February 17, 2023. To assess the proposed forecasting methodology's performance in terms of model consistency, efficiency and accuracy, we analyze models in different data set ratios and calculate four mean errors, correlation coefficients and directional mean accuracy. Last, the authors recommend testing the proposed filtering-combination approach for additional complicated financial time series data in the future to achieve highly accurate, efficient and consistent forecasts.\nView\nShow abstract\n... First, the technique is developed to analyze environmental pollution data based on univariate time series from various sources. Further studies are required for its validation in other contexts (for example, in data related to air quality [59][60][61], solid waste [62], also in academic performance data [63], data related to digital marketing [64] or those based on energy efficiency [65,66]). One of the methodology's significant limitations is that it does not preserve the time series structure since it assumes an auto-regressive model with a predefined lag size. ...\nSelf-Organizing Topological Multilayer Perceptron: A Hybrid Method to Improve the Forecasting of Extreme Pollution Values\nArticle\nFull-text available\n\n\nNov 2023\n\n\nJavier Linkolk López-Gonzales\n\nAna María Gómez\nRomina Torres\nRodrigo Salas\n\nForecasting air pollutant levels is essential in regulatory plans focused on controlling and mitigating air pollutants, such as particulate matter. Focusing the forecast on air pollution peaks is challenging and complex since the pollutant time series behavior is not regular and is affected by several environmental and urban factors. In this study, we propose a new hybrid method based on artificial neural networks to forecast daily extreme events of PM2.5 pollution concentration. The hybrid method combines self-organizing maps to identify temporal patterns of excessive daily pollution found at different monitoring stations, with a set of multilayer perceptron to forecast extreme values of PM2.5 for each cluster. The proposed model was applied to analyze five-year pollution data obtained from nine weather stations in the metropolitan area of Santiago, Chile. Simulation results show that the hybrid method improves performance metrics when forecasting daily extreme values of PM2.5.\nView\nShow abstract\n...

Its negative impacts go far beyond ecosystems and the economy, harming human health and environmental sustainability. Given these facts, efficient and accurate modeling and forecasting for the concentration of ozone are vital. Thus, this study explores an in-depth analysis of forecasting the concentration of ozone by comparing many hybrid combinations of time series models. To this end, in the first phase, the hourly ozone time series is decomposed into three new sub-series, including the long-term trend, the seasonal trend, and the stochastic series, by applying the seasonal trend decomposition method. In the second phase, we forecast every sub-series with three popular time series models and all their combinations In the final phase, the results of each sub-series forecast are combined to achieve the results of the final forecast. The proposed hybrid time series forecasting models were applied to four Metropolitan Lima monitoring stations-ATE, Campo de Marte, San Borja, and Santa Anita-for the years 2017, 2018, and 2019 in the winter season. Thus, the combinations of the considered time series models generated 27 combinations for each sampling station. They demonstrated significant forecasts of the sample based on highly accurate and efficient descriptive, statistical, and graphic analysis tests, as a lower mean error occurred in the optimized forecast models compared to baseline models. The most effective hybrid models for the ATE, Campo de Marte, San Borja, and Santa Anita stations were identified based on their superior out-of-sample forecast results, as measured by RMSE (4.611, 3.637, 1.495, and 1.969), RMSPE (4.464, 11.846, 1.864, and 15.924), MAE (1.711, 2.356, 1.078, and 1.462), and MAPE (14.862, 20.441, 7.668, and 76.261) errors. These models significantly outperformed other models due to their lower error values. In addition, the best models are statistically significant (p < 0.05) and superior to the rest of the combination models. Furthermore, the final proposed models show significant performance with the least mean error, which is comparatively better than the considered baseline models. Finally, the authors also recommend using the proposed hybrid time series combination forecasting models to predict ozone concentrations in other districts of Lima and other parts of Peru.\nView\nShow abstract\n... Furthermore, since only linear and non-linear univariate and multivariate time series models were used in this work, machine learning models such as deep learning and artificial neural networks can also be considered within the current decomposition combination forecasting framework. It can also be extended and applied to other approaches and datasets (for example, energy [53][54][55], air pollution [56][57][58][59], solid waste [60] and academic performance [61]). ...\nDay-Ahead Electricity Demand Forecasting Using a Novel Decomposition Combination Method\nArticle\nFull-text available\n\n\nNov 2023\n\n\nHasnain Iftikhar\n\nJosue Turpo\nPaulo Canas Rodrigues\nJavier Linkolk López-Gonzales\n\nIn the present liberalized energy markets, electricity demand forecasting is critical for planning of generation capacity and required resources. An accurate and efficient electricity demand forecast can reduce the risk of power outages and excessive power generation. Avoiding blackouts is crucial for economic growth, and electricity is an essential energy source for industry. Considering these facts, this study presents a detailed analysis of the forecast of hourly electricity demand by comparing novel decomposition methods with several univariate and multivariate time series models. To that end, we use the three proposed decomposition methods to divide the electricity demand time series into the following subseries: a long-run linear trend, a seasonal trend, and a stochastic trend. Next, each subseries is forecast using all conceivable combinations of univariate and multivariate time series models. Finally, the multiple forecasting models are immediately integrated to provide a final one-day-ahead electricity demand forecast. The presented modeling and forecasting technique is implemented for the Nord Pool electricity market’s hourly electricity demand. Three accuracy indicators, a statistical test, and a graphical analysis are used to assess the performance of the proposed decomposition combination forecasting technique. Hence, the forecasting results demonstrate the efficiency and precision of the proposed decomposition combination forecasting technique. In addition, the final best combination model within the proposed forecasting framework is comparatively better than the best models proposed in the literature and standard benchmark models. Finally, we suggest that the decomposition combination forecasting approach developed in this study be employed to handle additional complicated power market forecasting challenges.\nView\nShow abstract\n... Machine learning models such as deep learning and artificial neural networks can also be considered part of the current forecasting decompositioncombination technique. It can also be extended and applied to other approaches and datasets (for example, energy [1,3], air pollution [67][68][69][70], solid waste [71] and academic performance [72]). ...\nForecasting Day-Ahead Electricity Prices for the Italian Electricity Market Using a New Decomposition-Combination Technique\nArticle\nFull-text available\n\n\nSep 2023\n\n\nHasnain Iftikhar\n\nJosue Turpo\nPaulo Canas Rodrigues\nJavier Linkolk López-Gonzales\n\nOver the last 30 years, day-ahead electricity price forecasts have been critical to public and private decision-making. This importance has increased since the global wave of deregulation and liberalization in the energy sector at the end of the 1990s. Given these facts, this work presents a new decomposition-combination technique that employs several nonparametric regression methods and various time-series models to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of day-ahead electricity price forecasting. For this purpose, first, the time-series of the original electricity prices deals with the treatment of extreme values. Second, the filtered series of the electricity prices is decomposed into three new subseries, namely the long-term trend, a seasonal series, and a residual series, using two new proposed decomposition methods. Third, we forecast each subseries using different univariate and multivariate time-series models and all possible combinations. Finally, the individual forecasting models are combined directly to obtain the final one-day-ahead price forecast. The proposed decomposition-combination forecasting technique is applied to hourly spot electricity prices from the Italian electricity-market data from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2019. Hence, four different accuracy mean errors-mean absolute error, mean squared absolute percent error, root mean squared error, and mean absolute percent error; a statistical test, the Diebold-Marino test; and graphical analysis are determined to check the performance of the proposed decomposition-combination forecasting method. The experimental findings (mean errors, statistical test, and graphical analysis) show that the proposed forecasting method is effective and accurate in day-ahead electricity price forecasting. Additionally, our forecasting outcomes are comparable to those described in the literature and are regarded as standard benchmark models. Finally, the authors recommended that the proposed decomposition-combination forecasting technique in this research work be applied to other complicated energy market forecasting challenges.\nView\nShow abstract\n... Furthermore, the findings of this study indicate that the proposed combination model outperformed other methods in capturing the complex and nonlinear behavior of crude oil prices. This suggests that the hybrid forecasting approach holds promise for applications beyond crude oil prices (for example, energy [47,48], air pollution [49][50][51], solid waste [52], academic performance [53] and digital marketing [54]). Therefore, it is recommended to employ this methodology for forecasting other complex financial time series data, such as inflation, unemployment, and cryptocurrencies. ...\nForecasting Day-Ahead Brent Crude Oil Prices Using Hybrid Combinations of Time Series Models\nArticle\nFull-text available\n\n\nAug 2023\n\n\nHasnain Iftikhar\n\nAimel Zafar\nJosue Turpo\nJavier Linkolk López-Gonzales\n\nCrude oil price forecasting is an important research area in the international bulk commodity market. However, as risk factors diversify, price movements exhibit more complex nonlinear behavior. Hence, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of forecasting Brent crude oil prices by comparing various hybrid combinations of linear and nonlinear time series models. To this end, first, the logarithmic transformation is used to stabilize the variance of the crude oil prices time series; second, the original time series of log crude oil prices is decomposed into two new subseries, such as a long-run trend series and a stochastic series, using the Hodrick-Prescott filter; and third, two linear and two nonlinear time series models are considered to forecast the decomposed subseries. Finally, the forecast results for each subseries are combined to obtain the final day-ahead forecast result. The proposed modeling framework is applied to daily Brent spot prices from 1 January 2013 to 27 December 2022. Six different accuracy metrics, pictorial analysis, and a statistical test are performed to verify the proposed methodology's performance. The experimental results (accuracy measures, pictorial analysis, and statistical test) show the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed hybrid forecasting methodology. Additionally, our forecasting results are comparatively better than the benchmark models. Finally, we believe that the proposed forecasting method can be used for other complex financial time data to obtain highly efficient and accurate forecasts.\nView\nShow abstract\nShow more\nProposal for the Management of Solid Urban Waste Generated in Naranjillo, Capital of the District of Luyando, Perú\nArticle\nFull-text available\n\n\nApr 2022\n\n\nE. Daza\n\nA. Da Cruz\nSteve Dann Camargo Hinostroza\nNadia Balbin\n\nTo meet the objectives, the solid urban waste generated in Naranjillo is characterized and quantified and its adequate management is proposed. For this purpose, the methodology of the United Nations Urban Management Program, the calculation of the sanitary landfill through the guide for the design, construction, and operation of manual sanitary landfills, by Jorge Jaramillo, was used. The study determined 91.14% of usable solid waste and 8.86% of unusable solid waste whose final disposal should be in the sanitary landfill. 75.72% are organic waste that have the biological treatment in the composting plant; 15.42% of inorganic solid waste should be recycled through classification in the manual segregation plant, both components should enter the economic cycle. The volume of the landfill calculated until 2030 corresponds to 1555.80m ³ for a projected population of 4695 inhabitants in that year: with an urban solid waste production of 1575.86 Kg/day. The municipality of the district of Luyando by applying the proposed model of urban solid waste will improve the quality of life of its inhabitants by avoiding the contamination of water, soil, air, and the deterioration of the landscape.\nView\nShow abstract\nEnvironmental Management Virtual Methodology for Household Waste Characterization During The Pandemic in An Urban District of Peru: Citizen Science for Waste Management\nArticle\nFull-text available\n\nJun 2022\n\nENVIRON MANAGE\n\n\nNorvin Requena Sánchez\n\nDalia Carbonel\nStephan Moonsammy\nKelvin Tsun Wai Ng\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has caused the alteration of many aspects of the solid waste management chain, such as variations in the waste composition, generation and disposal. Various studies have examined these changes with analysis of integrated waste management strategies; qualitative studies on perceived variations and statistical evaluations based on waste collected or disposed in landfills. Despite this information there is a need for updated data on waste generation and composition, especially in developing countries. The objective of this article is to develop a data sampling and analytical approach for the collection of data on household waste generation and composition during the pandemic; and, in addition, estimate the daily generation of masks in the study area. The proposed methodology is based on the principles of citizen science and utilizes virtual tools to contact participants, and for the training and collection of information. The study participants collected the information, installed segregation bins in their homes and trained their relatives in waste segregation. The article presents the results of the application of the methodology in an urban district of Lima (Peru) in August 2020. The results suggest an apparent decrease in household waste per capita and a slight increase in plastics composition in the study area. It is estimated that each participant generates 0.124 masks per day and 0.085 pairs of gloves per day. The method developed and results presented can be used as a tool for public awareness and training on household waste characterization and segregation. Furthermore it can provide the necessary evidence to inform policy directives in response household waste issues and Covid-19 restrictions.\nView\nShow abstract\nTransformation of Solid Waste Management in China: Moving towards Sustainability through Digitalization-Based Circular Economy\nArticle\nFull-text available\n\n\nFeb 2022\n\n\nTonni Agustiono Kurniawan\n\nXue Liang\nElizabeth O’Callaghan\nTutuk Djoko Kusworo\n\nIn China, environmental pollution due to municipal solid waste (MSW) over-generation is one of the country’s priority concerns. The increasing volume and complexity of the waste poses serious risks to the environment and public health. Currently, the annual growth of MSW generation is estimated to be approximately 8–10% and will increase to 323 million metric tons (Mt) by 2030. Based on the secondary data collected from a literature survey, this article critically evaluates the recent progress of MSW management (MSWM) in China and offers new insights into the waste sector in the era of Industry 4.0. This helps decision makers in China to plan a smooth transition nationwide to a circular economy (CE) in the waste sector. It is evident that digitalization is a driving force for China to move towards low-carbon development strategies within the framework of CE. Through digitalization, the waste sector has promoted prevention, reduction, reuse, and recycling (3Rs) of waste before waste disposal in landfills. A proper implementation of digitalization-based waste recycling has contributed to an efficient cooperation between the government and private sector, increased job opportunities, and promoted the conservation of resources. It is anticipated that this work not only contributes to the establishment of an integrated MSWM system in China, but also improves local MSWM through digitalization in the framework of a CE.\nView\nShow abstract\nTechno-economic analysis of an enhanced anaerobic digester in the Andean area of Peru\nArticle\nFull-text available\n\n\nJan 2022\n\n\nAdriana Jaeger\n\nRichard Blanchard\n\nThis paper aims to determine the economic and technical feasibility of developing a thermally enhanced digester in the Andean area using solar collectors. Communities in the rural area of the Andes lack access to electricity and other basic services which impact negatively on their everyday life and exposes them to harmful and inefficient fuels. Several experiences with anaerobic digestion prove that this technology could be applied in the Andean area, although its performance is limited due to low temperatures. To overcome this constraint, an enhanced digester was modelled and simulated using TRNSYS Software. The system consisted of two solar collectors, a storage tank and a digester with a wrapped-around heat exchanger. The average digester temperature in the simulation was 30.7 °C. The enhanced temperature was used in a model to calculate the daily biogas production. The Net Present Value and Internal Rate of Return were calculated and confirm the economic viability of the project. The biogas production fully covers the requirements of the system for household cooking and lighting, making a significant social impact. This simulation indicates that it is technically possible to develop an enhanced digester in the Andean area that is economically viable as well.\nView\nShow abstract\nA novel methodology for household waste characterization during the COVID-19 pandemic: case study results\nArticle\nFull-text available\n\n\nOct 2021\n\n\nNorvin Requena Sánchez\n\nDalia Carbonel\nLuis F. Diaz Campodónico\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused a large number of the world’s cities to establish quarantines. Much has been said about the environmental impacts of the confinement; however, very little data have been collected related to household waste generation and composition. In this study, the authors propose a novel methodology for the characterization of household waste without having to leave home, by using virtual training and completing forms. The results of the evaluation carried out in late September 2020 in three districts in the Arequipa province, Peru (Districts A, B and C) are presented. A total of 246 people participated in a survey on waste generation and segregation habits, and 44 people participated in the waste characterization study. Taking into account the error of the study, it can only be stated with certainty that waste generation decreased only in District B. The percentage of organic waste declined in Districts A and B, and increased in District C. Composition of hazardous and sanitary wastes increased significantly in all three districts. Each household generated an average of two to four masks and one pair of gloves per week.\nView\nShow abstract\nContaminación por Residuos Sólidos Urbanos: Caso Comunidad de Occochaca, Huanta, Perú, 2021\nArticle\nFull-text available\n\n\nJul 2021\n\n\nCarlos Enrique Marchan-Solier\n\nValeria Alejandra Zorrilla-Crespo\nMariano Anthony Cardenas-Quispe\nAlex Pacheco\n\nLa contaminación por residuos sólidos urbanos es un problema que afecta a todas las ciudades sobre todo en las zonas rurales de la región de Ayacucho.

These inappropriate wastes cause deterioration of the environment and the ozone layer. This is why we are currently seeing an abrupt change in climate and diseases caused by environmental pollution. The objective of the research work is to perform a system dynamics modeling for effective and efficient solid waste management in Lima Peru, and thus contribute to the scientific community to achieve a future vision for solid waste management. The methodology used was system dynamics, which made it possible to analyze and understand the behavior of a complex solid waste system in a given time. In addition, vensim software was used for system dynamics modeling, creating the causal diagram and forrester diagram for solid waste management. The results obtained are the system dynamics modeling proposed for solid waste management, which were modeled from 2020 to 2030, where by 2030 it will be reduced in favorable equilibrium to 23,066 tons. Thanks to this system dynamics modeling, society will be made aware of the need to sort and use solid waste, in order to reduce environmental pollution. Likewise, having a healthy environment that will benefit health, agriculture and education will benefit society as a whole.\nView\nShow abstract\nCellulolytic and Amylolytic Bacteria with Potential for Composting Urban Solid Waste at Low Temperatures in Northern Peru\nArticle\n\n\nJan 2022\n\n\nCarlos Millones\n\nErnestina Rosario Vásquez\nSamia L.

As important participants, consumers' behaviors and attitudes will play a vital role in solving the problem. This study uses the conditional value method (CVM) to evaluate the differences in the attitudes and willingness to pay of urban and rural residents toward EPW in Guangdong Province, China. The results show that the respondents have limited knowledge of the recycling situation, relevant policies and environmental impacts of express delivery packaging, although more than 60% of respondents do think that there is a problem with excessive packaging. The low recycling rate for packaging materials is mainly attributed to the lack of recycling facilities and publicity on environmental issues. The differences between urban and rural residents are mainly over disposal methods, the views on excessive packaging and willingness to pay (WTP) for EPW. Finally, the WTP values of urban and rural residents choosing a “deposit” system are 1.58 (0.24)and1.79yuan(0.24) and 1.79 yuan (0.28) per piece, respectively, while the WTP values (for increased fees) are 0.64 yuan (0.10)and0.60yuan(0.10) and 0.60 yuan (0.09) per piece, respectively. The obtained results may serve as a reference for different regional responses to the promotion and improvement of EPW management in the future.\nView\nShow abstract\nShow more\nPowered By\n00:00/01:38\n10\n107.6M\n225\nTop three ways social proof can boost your organic reach and engagement\nShare\nNext\nStay\n\n\nRecommended publications\nDiscover more\nConference Paper\nCharacterization and Management Practices of Solid Waste Generated from Hotels in Awka City, Nigeria\nJanuary 2023\n\nObiora B.

Established at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), Agenda 21 states that “the environmentally sound management of waste should go beyond the simple disposal or use by safe methods of waste produced and seek to solve the root cause of the problem trying to change unsustainable patterns of production and consumption.\" To this end, one of the principles put forward in Agenda 12 was the adoption of the 3Rs – Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. OECD countries in particular have since evolved the 3Rs into an economic model that envisions that the linear flow of materials (resources-product-waste) be transformed into a circular flow (resource-product-recycled resources) capable of generating both environmental and financial returns. In the decade following the UNCED, the Latin American country that took some of the most progressive steps toward adopting the principals and practices espoused in the Rio Declaration was Peru. Peruʼs promotion of the 3Rs and adoption of the framework of the circular economy across its national and local government systems has created a vibrant new economy around recyclable solid waste in the Andean nation of 32 million people. The recycling sector in Peru is relatively nascent and largely informal, but the growth and opportunity to be found in the sector is considerable, whether from an economic, societal or environmental perspective. For the purposes of this report, the opportunity of most interest is the growth to be found in the economy and associated value chain of Integrated Solid Waste Management in Peru. To understand this economy requires an assessment of the laws and regulations that support and govern the sector, the actors involved and how value is added and extracted throughout the value chain. Additionally, we must look at the constraints each actor faces and the investment they require to maximize enterprise potential, all with the goal of unlocking the inherent economic value found in the sector. With the support of the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth, this report seeks to do this by examining the legal framework that provides the foundation for progress and future growth, the key actors and their roles within the supply chain, and the best opportunities to invest in the growth and formalization of enterprises operating in the recycled waste sector in Peru. The conclusion of this report identifies significant opportunity to transform the waste management sector in Peru by engaging key actors who are well-positioned to strengthen the recycling and waste management sector as a whole while expanding new market and microenterprise opportunities. 4 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This report was made possible through the generous support of the MasterCard Center for Inclusive Growth.

The primary goal of the study was to illuminate the structure, market conditions and key actors in Peruʼs recyclable solid waste management value chain. The secondary goal was to determine the feasibility of expanding the formal capacity and access to market for the micro and small firms operating in the sector. The report was designed to assess three core elements of the posited opportunity which are presented in the following three sections. Section 1: Waste Management Value Chain and Market Assessment: The first section provides an overview of the waste management value chain in Peru, the regulatory framework in which it operates, and the market actors and opportunities found in the recyclable waste sector in particular. The market assessment is designed to both determine the viability of enterprise opportunities in the sector and to identify current operators in the value chain positioned to leverage these opportunities. Section 2: Ciudad Saludableʼs Inclusive Recycling Model: The second section provides an analysis of the existing recycling centers model and operations. This section analyzes their capacity and constraints and assesses their opportunity for growth and value-added processes. Section 3: Opportunity Landscape: The third section provides an overview of opportunities identified to engage the sector and encourage enterprise growth in the recycled waste value chain. Each opportunity may be considered independently, but there are links between each, and combined they represent a significant chance to transform waste management system in Peru to a truly integrated locally owned, market-oriented system. This report relied on extensive research on solid waste management processes, in-depth interviews with key stakeholders directly and indirectly involved in the recycling value chain, and direct observations of recyclers and recycling centers in the cities of Lima, Ica, Chincha, El Carmen, Sunampe, Pueblo Nuevo, Iquitos, as well as in the districts of Villa El Salvador, San Juan de Miraflores, Villa Maria del Triunfo, and Miraflores. 7 Figure 1: Peruʼs Constitutional Clauses on Environment Article 2: Everyone has the right: (...) 22). To peace, to tranquility, to the enjoyment of free time and to rest, as well as to enjoy a balanced and adequate environment for the development of your life. Article 66: Natural resources, renewable and non-renewable, are the Nation's heritage. The State is sovereign in its use. Article 67: The State determines the national environmental policy. Promotes sustainable use of natural resources. Article 195: Local governments promote development and the local economy, and the provision of public services of their responsibility, in harmony with national and regional development policies and plans. LEGAL FRAMEWORK Construct Environmental law in Peru is uniquely structured within a Constitutional framework that codifies it as the law of the people and not merely a regulatory mandate. This has enabled environmental law to hold an elevated place in Peru where it is considered a fundamental part of the shared stewardship of a shared land. As a result, environmental law does not merely define general principles – it also specifies processes for the application of the law, including establishing regulatory processes, defining the stakeholders, structures, programs and management instruments to be used, and implementing a broad set of definitions and designations that guide the oversight and management of environmental initiatives. Functionally, environmental management and stewardship, as decreed in the Constitution, is primarily the responsibility of the provincial and municipal government. A number of provinces and municipalities have in turn reinforced national law through their own state and local policies, which together have served to both prioritize environmental issues and to put leadership of environmental initiatives in local hands. In recent years, regulations have shifted environmental responsibility even further down by prescribing that citizens themselves adhere to and enforce environmental mandates, particularly related to management of the waste they produce. Specifically, the 2017 Supreme Decree No. 014-2017-MINAM, and the 2016 D.L 1278: Law of Integral Management of Solid Waste establish terms around the rights, obligations, attributions and responsibilities of society to ensure management of sanitary and environmentally sound waste. These statutes go as far as to establish the principles of a circular economy tied to waste valorization and put responsibility on the producer of the waste to protect the environment and be accountable for the public health principals laid out in the Constitution. This responsibility does not distinguish between individuals and businesses, though many of the provisions are more relevant to waste management by enterprises than by households. 8 Regulation The regulatory structure governing waste management in Peru has four (4) basic levels of authority over the determination and application of the environmental laws. At the highest levels are the national government agencies, which determine the legal requirements for waste management within the various sectors in which solid waste is produced, such as mining, agroindustry, energy production, hospitals, sanitation, and others. These sectors each have a national authority that oversee compliance with the law by registered operators in the respective sectors. The key environmental authority in Peru, however, is held at the provincial and municipal levels, which are broadly empowered to develop policies, regulate practices, and institutionalize programs for solid waste management. The law that establishes this principle of decentralization is Law No. 27783 [Law of Basis of Decentralization]. This regulates the conformation of the regions and municipalities, sets the competencies of the three levels of government and determines the assets and resources of regional and local governments, and regulates government relations at different levels. For waste management and environmental stewardship it stipulates in Article 6 that municipalities shall have oversight over: a) territorial and environmental regulation; b) sustainable management of natural resources and improvement of environmental quality; and c) inter-institutional coordination and citizen participation at all levels of the National Environmental Management System. For the purposes of this report, the other law that uniquely enables citizen-led waste management at the local level is Law No. 29419 [Law regulating the activity of waste pickers]. It establishes a framework for recycling workers' activities that is oriented to the protection, training, and promotion of social and labor development, promoting their formalization, association, and contribution to the improvement of the ecologically efficient management of solid waste in the country. Figure 2: Peruʼs Waste Management Regulatory Structure 9 Practice Through the decentralized regulatory structure that Peru has established for environmental protection and waste management, municipal leaders and community-based organizations and enterprises have become uniquely reliant on each other to both oversee and benefit from the management of recyclable solid waste. Under the General Waste Law, municipalities are mandated to create action plans for the management of waste and encouraged to create partnerships with the private sector and civil society to implement these plans so that they are not reliant on public service provisions. As a result, a number of municipalities have initiated innovative collaborations with actors in the recycling value chain that had previously operated on the margins, but are now fully integrated into the public scheme. A salient example of this are the formal agreements that municipalities have entered into with largely informal associations of “waste pickers” (recicladores) to provide household recycled waste collection in neighborhoods throughout Lima. Empowered through the “Waste Pickers Law” (Law No. 29419) and incentivized by collaborative agreement with the municipality, informal waste collectors who had previously worked on open dumps have formed micro-enterprises made up of associations of waste pickers that now provide household and business waste collection services in dedicated sections of cities. These agreements offer the associations exclusive “at source” access to the recyclable waste products that are the foundation of their livelihood, thus lowering costs, competition, and health and safety issues associated with collecting at open dumps or on the street. Municipalities in turn promote the social value and legal requirement that households and businesses sort and recycle their waste, further improving the market that the associations operate in. Municipalities have broad latitude to enter into such agreements, which functionally may reduce market competition to the benefit of the enterprise with whom they are partnered, but which firmly fall within the legal framework that enables local waste management solutions. There is a standing, non-binding 2017 goal of recycling 60% of recoverable waste and ensuring proper treatment and disposal of 70% of non-recoverable waste, but Peru is not currently close to achieving these numbers. The country has, however, established a progressive regulatory framework that empowers local leaders to solve local environmental and waste management challenges and creates a highly enabling environment for informal operators in the waste sector to become part of and benefit from the formal waste management system. To date, the vast majority of focus by national and local lawmakers has been on actors that that produce waste (businesses and households) and those that collect waste, but the legal framework is also structured to facilitate stewardship for the large market actors in the value chain who trade in, transport, process, and transform waste. For all levels, the goals of regulation are clearly 10 aimed at enabling greater and more effective environmental stewardship and creating opportunity and benefit for good operators in the sector, as opposed to the more punitive approach taken by many countries of sanctioning the bad ones. Current Landscape Peruʼs government has set in place a series of policy levers and strategy tools aimed at strengthening the waste management sector while enabling development of key market players through public, private, and international investment. Government objectives, coupled with a growing demand for comprehensive waste management, are focused on handling the volume of waste in the country while promoting green growth. Enabling an effective and sustainable integrated solid waste management is at the forefront of the Peruvian governmentʼs environmental sustainability, economic development, and macroeconomic growth initiatives. Peru has embraced green growth and undertaken commitments within the Paris Agreement and various government institutions, strategies, and plans. For example, the creation of the Ministry of the Environment (MINAM) in May 2008 marked a milestone in the development of a broad environmental institutional framework. MINAM is responsible for adapting the National Solid Waste policy and preparing and implementing comprehensive solid waste management plans (PIGARS), as well as the solid waste handling plans at the provincial and district levels (PMRS). In accordance with MINAMʼs goals, the Ministry has launched a series of programs and investment projects that tackle different aspects of comprehensive waste management, including Municipal Modernization Programs (PMMs), Segregation-at-Source Programs, and Formalization of Recyclers Programs. Additionally, MINAM leads information management and data collection through the solid waste management information system (SIGERSOL) and publishes regular reports and evaluations of environmental and waste management in Peru. Peruʼs focus on environmental policies goes hand-in-hand with the development of strategy instruments to coordinate pro-competitiveness policies and efficient management in the public and private sectors around key areas, such as comprehensive waste management. MINAM leads the implementation of the National Plan of Environmental Action (PLANAA Peru: 2011-2021), a national environmental planning policy that set priority targets for 2021 around waste management and recycling. Following the development and publication of PLANAA, the government, in partnership with the United Nations and 800 stakeholders from the public, private and civil society sectors representing a total of 271 institutions in Peru, developed the Plan Nacional de Gestión Integral de Residuos Sólidos: 2016-2024 (PLANRES). PLANRES is a cross-sectoral and de-centralized framework that establishes guidelines in alignment with PLANAA, and by extension, the Sustainable Development Goals, and serves as the principle plan 11 for waste management. Its objectives focus on strengthening the capacity of the waste management value chain; promoting best practices around waste management technology; creating a legal framework on solid waste management and environmental sustainability for municipalities; strengthening SIGERSOL to collect local, regional, national data in a timely and effective manner; strengthening solid waste collection at the municipal level; coordinating investment in the national solid waste management system; and promoting private investment in the waste management system. It was designed to meet PLANAAʼs most ambitious goal: calling for 100% of municipal solid waste management, recycling, and proper disposal by 2021. As part of this initiative, Peru is actively seeking to create additional landfill capacity to meet basic disposal requirements and has set a goal of achieving 100% adequate treatment of waste via the 3Rʼs (Reduce, Recycling, Reuse) and sanitary landfills by 2021. The governmentʼs goals for developing new sanitary landfills is intended to eliminate the practice of waste disposal in dumps with little active operation or environmental control. These ambitious goals reflect Peruʼs efforts to improve the management of municipal and non-municipal waste while strengthening the value chain. 12 SECTION 1: WASTE MANAGEMENT MARKET IN PERU Over the last 15 years, Peru has experienced a period of incredible growth led by strong internal demand, inclusive poverty reduction policies, and deep macroeconomic reforms that liberalized trade and fiscal policies. At present, the Peruvian economy is the 7th largest in Latin America and has experienced sustained growth from 2003-2017, with an average growth rate of 5.9% and low inflation rates (averaging 2.9%). After a massive urbanization process over the last 60 years, Peru is a mostly urban country, with about 60% of the population living in urban areas. In addition, Peru has opened its economy to international trade, with raw materials forming the core of its exports. This fast and widely shared growth has transformed Peru into an upper-middle income economy, with aspirations to become a high-income economy in the next 20 years. In parallel, this dynamic growth has been accompanied by increased production and consumption, and thus an increase in the generation of waste and recyclable materials. Over the last ten years, waste generation has grown by 40% per capita, reaching 0.78 kg per individual per day in 2009 and 0.83 kg per individual per day in 2014, and during this same period, investment from private, multilateral, and international funds to meet this demand through the construction of landfills, waste plants, and transfer stations totaled over S/. 2,000,000,000 (~$615 million USD). Figure 3: Municipal Waste Generated in Urban Zones, 2014 Solid Waste, Total Solid Waste, Household Solid Waste, Non-Household .83kg/person/day .56kg/person/day .27kg/person/day 7,030,000 tons/year 4,740,000 tons/year 2,290,000 tons/year 100% 67% 33% In Peru, approximately 7 million tons of waste is produced per year with over 70% collected from households, but only 48% of that material is properly disposed of in landfills; in many cases, waste is deposited in open-air dumps without prior treatment. Lima is the Peruvian city that generates the most household waste, with the amount doubling between 2000 and 2015 and increasing to represent over 30% of the national total in 2015. Estimations see household waste in the province of Lima growing to 16,000 tons per day by 2034 and growing across the country in parallel with expected per capita GDP growth. The Ministry of the Environmentʼs (MINAM) official data on recycled goods estimates that only 0.41% - or 29,099 tons - of total waste per year in Peru is recycled. However, 13 3064.51 387.06 361.04 327.73 290.28 256.96 220.57 192.18 189.03 185.68 181.59 177.97 149.19 131.15 104.79 104.51 93.63 79.77 54.3 49.93 49.46 45.39 38.78 36.32 28.72 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 Lima (department) Piura La Libertad Callao Arequipa Lambayeque Junín Loreto Áncash Cuzco Puno Ica San Martín Cajamarca Ucayali Ayacucho Huánuco Tacna Tumbes Apurímac Amazonas Pasco Moquegua Huancavelica Madre de Dios that figure does not accurately represent the amount of recycling material available in Peru and unofficial data estimates that approximately 14% of total waste is recycled in a given year. This discrepancy suggests that a significant amount of recycled materials come from informal work that recovers material from dumps, public roads, and informal arrangements with companies. There are also major divergences among regions with respect to available infrastructure and the availability of trash collection services. Figure 4: Waste Generation by Region, 2014 Of the 7 million tons of solid waste collected per year, approximately 5 million tons (74%) have the potential to be either recycled or composted. The largest categories of recyclable materials include plastic bags, paper, cardboard, and other more ridged forms of plastic. Figure 5: Potential Recycled Material of Municipal Waste Collected 56% 19% 18% 7% Organic Not Reusable Inorganic, Reusable Dangerous 14 Figure 6: Municipal Waste Generation by Type In Peru, there are 30 dumps across 43 cities and 11 sanitary dumps that receive 38% of the generated waste from urban zones. However, the proper management of waste within these landfills is insufficient and waste is piling up, untreated, unhealthy, and forgotten. These unmanaged, open landfills create broad environmental hazards and contribute to nearly 6% of Peruʼs greenhouse gas emissions. They are also the cause of serious health and environmental hazards in surrounding communities, as highlighted by the flooding in northern Peru in 2017, which carried away solid waste, demolishing houses, contaminating streams and drinking water, and ultimately polluting the sea. With only 14% of Peruʼs annual waste being turned into recycled materials, but the potential for as much as 74% being recycled or composted, the opportunity for robust expansion of Peruʼs recycling sector is significant. Peruʼs commitment to strengthening the waste management sector and value chain to enable green growth, economic development, and market competition and activity is highlighted across the various policies, planning documents, and strategy tools the government has developed. Enabling further formalization and professionalization of the sector are understood as critical to meeting Peruʼs economic and green growth Components Composition Organic Material 53.16% Foliage/Wood 2.87% Paper 3.86% Cardboard 3.74% Glass 2.79% PET Plastic 2.39% Hard Plastic 2.88% Bags 4.03% Tetra Pak 0.51% Styrofoam 0.98% Metal 2.34% Fabrics/Textiles 1.47% Rubber/Leather 1.12% Batteries 0.30% Medical Waste 0.40% Sanitary Waste 6.53% Inert Waste 8.15% Other 2.49% Total 100.00% 15 goals, as well as increasing market demand for these services. This enabling regulatory and political environment furthers the breadth of the recycling market and the opportunities for engagement, which are explored below. RECYCLING VALUE CHAIN Peruʼs recycling value chain is comprised of six stages – 1) Generation, 2) Recovery, 3) Commercialization, 4) Conditioning, 5) Transformation, and 6) Final Consumption. An overview of this process has been summarized in the following flow chart. Figure 7: Flow Chart of Recycling Value Chain Stage 1 (Generation) refers to the amount of waste generated by a particular group such as households, commercial businesses, offices, industries, or other actors. Through the analysis of per capita generation and the composition of solid waste, we can estimate the re-usable quantity, classifying it as recyclable and compostable, as well as the potential for effective segregation, essential indicators for the design of a program of segregation at the source and selective collection. Stage 2 (Recovery) refers to the method in which the waste is collected and, where possible, segregated. For example, for households, recovery is at the source through garbage collection routes typically managed by municipalities or individual recyclers and recycler associations. The act of segregation is separating out material such as packing or food that can be reused, recycled, or consumed as swine feed and which typically 16 have a commercial value. This is carried out formally through segregation programs at the source and selective collection, i.e. pre-sorted at homes, businesses, and industries or informally on public roads through public cleaning services, transfer points, dumps or landfills by recyclers or public cleaning workers. Stage 3 (Commercialization) includes the act of buying and selling reusable solid waste. This is typically carried out in either informal warehouses, formal collection centers, or final sites such as dumps and landfills. The warehouses and collection centers can range from small, family-run centers to large, professional centers. Stage 4 (Conditioning) refers to the processing of recycled materials. This stage includes activities such as storage, cleaning, crushing or grinding, compacting, and packaging. This stage does not include treatment of any recycled materials. These processes are carried out by a range of actors from micro-enterprises to large export companies. Each actor responds to the demand of local reuse markets, large industries such as bottling companies, and exporting companies. Stage 5 (Transformation) refers to the act of transforming the recycled materials, either through physical or chemical reprocessing, from solid waste into intermediate or final products that can be used by various buyers. Buyers can purchase raw material or recycled products for local or export markets. Stage 6 (Final Consumption) is the last stage of the value chain in which the recycled products are consumed or converted again into waste which would then return to the start of the recycling chain. Across each of these stages and levels is a wide variety of movement and variation. For example, a large office building or shopping mall may have its waste collected by a municipal garbage collector or an association of informal workers. Small enterprises that store solid waste, as described in Stage 4, may sell to a local market or regional buyer. Therefore, it is important to understand that within each stage of the value chain there is tremendous variability and complexity in the movement of materials which, in turn, affects the variability of the prices. 17 KEY ACTORS FOR ENGAGEMENT Within the recycling value chain, there are four key segments of actors – Recyclers, Intermediaries, Marketers, and Industries/Exporters – which can be summarized in the following Recycling Actors Pyramid. Figure 8: Pyramid of Key Actors in Recycling Value Chain Pyramid Recyclers Often referred to as waste pickers or recicladores, the 108,594 recyclers at the base of the Recycling Actors Pyramid are the first link in the recycling value chain, recovering waste from generating sources such as open dumps, streets, residences, businesses, and other public spaces. Of the approximate 109,000 recyclers, only 13,000 (or 12%) are formal workers, either organized into recycler associations or micro-enterprises. These workers are represented by 311 waste picker organizations, of which 291 are recycler associations and 20 are Micro and Small Enterprises (MYPES). These associations and micro-enterprises operate in municipalities across the country with the largest concentration (78 organizations) in the provinces of Metropolitan Lima and Callao. In addition to these formal organizations, recyclers are also represented at the national level through trade associations such as the National Network of Recyclers of Peru (RENAREP). However, the majority of recyclers are informal workers. Informal recyclers are drawn from poor and vulnerable sectors of society; the low barriers to entry coupled with a ready income drives impoverished workers to waste picking. Waste, and particularly recyclable materials, are relatively easy to access and have both value and an accessible Recyclers (Recicladores) Intermediaries (Acopiadores) Marketers Industries & Exporters 62 2,023 13,002 108,59 4 78 18 Opportunity Highlight – Intermediaries act as the primary bridge between collection (Stage 2) and the rest of the value chain, although some Waste Picker Associations sell directly to Marketers or Exporting and Manufacturing companies. Most are small enterprises that operate informally and would benefit from formalization support as well as technical assistance to increase the volume of goods processed and their ability to capture more of the value chain. market to sell to. Waste pickers, and particularly those operating on open dumps and on the streets, work in hazardous conditions and lack access to public services, healthcare, protective gear and the proper tools that might otherwise improve productivity. Due to an absence of economies of scale, informal waste pickers have weak bargaining power in the recycling value chain. With poor opportunities and insufficient earnings, informal pickers are unrecognized and unprotected actors in the waste management system – despite their clear, critical role in the market. Intermediaries The second category of actors is the most dynamic economic group in the recycling chain, commonly known as Intermediaries (Acopiadores). Intermediaries represent a large variation of actors, including small and medium sized businesses or waste picker associations operating formally or informally that purchases and sells recyclable solid waste and/or provides home and selective waste collection services. Many Intermediaries operate small enterprises ranging from 50 square meters to 2,200 square meters in residential or commercial areas that are typically located close to dumps and landfills. They have little specialization and are usually limited to the purchase and sale of recycled materials – Stage 3 (Commercialization) and some elements of Stage 4 (Conditioning) including storage. Where some Intermediaries have received technical assistance or financial support, they have expanded into Stage 4 (Conditioning) such as cleaning or pressing or materials and Stage 5 (Transformation) such as the chopping of PET materials. Intermediaries typically have between 2 and 10 people working for them and require minimal capital investment and operate with between S/. 2,000 soles and S/. 10,000 soles (~$610 USD to $3,100 USD) per month. There are approximately 13,000 Intermediaries across Peru with over 8,000 operating in urban areas. A typical urban intermediary can sell between 1 to 15 tons per month. Opportunity Highlight - The best opportunity for engagement with recyclers is to help them organize into formal recycling associations (“Associations”) that can compete for selective collection routes with municipalities and businesses, provide greater social protections including access to healthcare and social security programs, access to training programs, and eventually establish their own collection facilities. 19 Opportunity Highlight – The majority of value in the recycling value chain is added during the Conditioning Stage (#4). As a result, Marketers are well positioned to take advantage of additional support and investment to scale their operations. Marketers that store large volumes of raw or semi-processed recycled materials fare better because they can wait longer periods of time for a more favorable price point. Given their size and asset portfolio, many Marketers have decent access to capital, although not always at the most favorable rates. Technical assistance and support to improve business practices, increase efficiencies, and strengthen operations would benefit this group. Marketers The Marketers are the third rung in the recycling pyramid. They are medium to large enterprises and typically operate in metropolitan trade zones and industrial zones. Marketers can be involved in Stage 3 (Commercialization), Stage 4 (Conditioning), Stage 5 (Transformation) and, occasionally, Stage 6 (Final Consumption) of the recycling value chain. Many Marketers have three locations – one location to purchase and sell recyclable waste to retailers in the surrounding areas, another location to classify, carry, and label goods, and a final location where they carry out the conditioning process, i.e. pressing chopping, packaging, and shipping. Most Marketers specialize in at least two types of waste such as A) paper or cardboard, B) PET and plastics, or C) scrap and metals to protect themselves against price instability and market volatility. Marketers typically process over 15 tons of recycled materials per month and operate with a working capital greater than S/. 30,000 soles (~$9,200) per month. In addition to large footprints, their primary assets are in equipment for the conditioning of waste such as electronic scales; paper press machines; metal, PET and plastic choppers; and vehicles for transporting materials. Given their size and asset portfolio, they can access financial services relatively easily as well as regional market technologies. Their access to the export market is conditional on whether they have secured an EC-RS license – an authorization of commercialization of solid waste - issued by the Health Sector or MINAM. Of the 2,023 Marketers estimated nationally, only 555 have EC-RS registration, but EC-RS registration is growing dramatically. Across a sample of 19 selected provinces, EC-RS registration almost tripled between 2008 and 2009 alone. Exporters and Industrial Companies At the top of the pyramid are two types of actors – Exporters and Industrial Companies. These companies reuse or transform recyclable waste into final products for consumption. The group is the smallest within the value chain, although it captures a decent portion of the value added. They are characterized by a high level of specialization, technological development, organization, and financial capacity. There are 78 national industries and 62 export companies. National industries include recycling 20 industries of plastic, paper, cardboard, scrap, metals and glass, as well as bottling companies that promote the use of returnable glass containers, gas companies that promote the returnable use of gas cylinders, and other industries that promote the consumption of spare parts that have been manufactured with minimal packaging. For most recyclable materials, there are a small number of large companies that dominate the market. For glass, the primary company is Owen Illinois, a multi-national corporation that is the largest buyer of recycled glass fiber for the manufacturing of bottles; they typically demand approximately 30 tons of glass per month for their processing. For PET plastic, a major company is San Miguel Industries which specializes in PET processing; San Miguel Industries requires approximately 3,000 tons of PET per month. The primary paper industries include Kimberly Clarke (Lima) that serves a national market, Productos Tissue del Perú S.A – PROTISA (Elite Brand), Papelera del Sur, and PROVESUR. Papelera del Sur can require as much as 70 tons of cardboard or paper per month, whereas PROVESUR typically requires between 15 and 20 tons per month. The primary scrap companies are Aceros Arequipa Corporation in the south and SIDER Peru in Chimbote in the north. Aceros Arequipa typically requires between 15 and 20 tons of metal scrap per month. OPPORTUNITY ANALYSIS Over the past decade, Peru has become a regional leader in championing and instituting a range of strong environmental policies, including a commitment to achieve 100% adequate treatment of waste through the 3Rʼs (Reduce, Recycling, Reuse) model and sanitary landfills by 2021. The promotion of a circular economy is starting to take hold, although there remains significant room for growth. For example, a decade ago, 80% of the recycled material in Peru was exported and only 20% was consumed by domestic markets. Today, the opposite is true, with only 20% of recycled goods being exported. With the recent passage of Decree D.L. 1278 – The Law of Integral Management of Solid Waste - which mandates municipalities create comprehensive waste management plans that prioritize waste prevention and reduction and encourages partnerships with the private sector, the current legal framework is one of the most progressive in Latin America. In addition, outdated regulations have been replaced by more environmentally friendly policies that incentivize the use of recycled materials. For example, until as recently as 2016 there was a prohibition against the use of recycled resin in bottle Opportunity Highlight – Industries and Exporters are large national and multi-national companies (MNCs) most of which are in good financial standing. The best opportunity for engagement with this group of stakeholders would be to work closely with them to negotiate more favorable purchasing agreements for Collectors and/or Marketers. 21 production due to a misperception of recycled plastic as “dirty.” As a result, bottle manufactures had to import virgin resin for their production processes. However, once this prohibition was removed, several manufacturing companies began integrating recycled resin into their manufacturing processes, reducing costs and increasing demand for recycled materials from domestic suppliers. After D.S. 038-14 was passed, San Miguel Industries, the largest buyer of PET in Peru, invested in the required technology and increased demand from 10 tons of PET per month to 3,000 tons per month. In a similar vein, exporters have changed their business operations from exporting bulk bottles to transforming materials in-country into products such as flakes or scraps, allowing them to capture more value from the value chain and sell at higher prices. The relatively quick change in business operations as legal constraints were removed suggests that there is a strong interest and demand for recycled goods domestically. In Peru, the three major tradable recycled materials are Paper, Plastics, and Metal. In 2016, Peru had a positive trade balance in terms of volume of paper (i.e. more paper exported than imported), although the total value of paper traded was negative, indicating that import prices were higher than export prices. For plastics, both volume and value of plastics had a negative trade balance, indicating that Peruʼs internal supply is still not meeting domestic demand. For metal, the trade balance was also negative for both volume and value of traded goods.

While Peru has the potential to supply the current 22 demand for imported materials, it does not currently have the capacity to do so because much of the recyclable waste is left unrecovered in poorly managed landfills or rural dumps that are inaccessible to urban markets both due to high transportation costs and lack of proper cleaning, processing, or transformation. However, several of the challenges preventing scaling of collection capacity are being addressed through international investments. With the Government of Peruʼs strong commitment to environmentally friendly policies and legal frameworks, international partners have been eager to invest in building Peruʼs capacity to capitalize on this momentum. Partnerships with Japanʼs International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) have focused on building more efficient and hygienic waste management sites, introducing environmentally conscious technology, and strengthening local capacity and management structures. In addition, the Government of Peru is in discussions with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to implement a Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA)1 on Peruʼs waste management sector. The proposed NAMA is designed to complement and accelerate the existing modernization policy for solid waste management in Peru by creating incentives that increase the economic value of waste that currently goes to landfills and dumps. With the combination of a strong government commitment to recycling, significant international investments in much needed infrastructure improvements and capacity building, and unmet demand for recycled materials, Peruʼs recycling industry is perfectly positioned for a dramatic expansion. Each of the actors within the recycling value chain are likely to benefit from this expansion; however, the Recyclers and Intermediaries are the best positioned for dramatic growth. Primed for Growth – Recyclers and Intermediaries Approximately 90% of the supply chain is represented by Recyclers and Intermediaries. Despite the significant volume processed by these actors, the overwhelming majority of both Recyclers and Intermediaries in Peru operate informally and at a relatively small scale. This has limited their ability to take advantage of the growth of the recycling sector, including selling larger quantities to buyers and capturing additional parts of the value chain. Because of the potential for growth, both are well positioned to be formalized and capacitated through the right combination of investment, technical assistance, and market facilitation to help them overcome the constraints that have limited their size and revenues. 1 A NAMA is a set of policies and actions aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions which is enabled by technology, financing, and capacity-building. 23 For Recyclers, the primary opportunity is to support their formalization into Waste Picker Associations, which can operate as micro-enterprises. Waste Picker Associations that have access to collection facilities – either through partnerships with existing facilities or by leasing properties themselves – can run their operations as small Intermediaries and therefore would be well-positioned to take advantage of the same opportunities as Intermediaries, as outlined below. The roughly 13,000 Intermediaries occupy a key space for enterprise opportunity due to their processing volume and their ability to link between Recyclers and Marketers or Exporters. With technical assistance around formalizing their operations, support to create bank accounts, and/or small loans to help them purchase processing equipment, vehicles, or lease larger spaces, Intermediaries could not only increase the volume of raw materials purchased and sold, but also engage in more value-added activities such as cleaning or pressing. For example, if an Intermediary was able to purchase a plastic bottle pressing machine for their facility, they could increase the volume of materials stored as well as sell the plastic at a higher price point to large buyers who only purchase plastic pre-pressed. Another opportunity for growth for Intermediaries would be improved buyer relationships, especially with the large Industries and Exporters that transform (Stage #5) plastic, paper, cardboard, and metal into products for final consumption (Stage #6). The primary barriers for Intermediaries to engage in these sought after relationships have been insufficient volumes to meet demand, inadequate sorting processes resulting in deliveries of mixed goods (i.e. white paper and cardboard combined rather than separated), inability to deliver products in line with transportation requirements, and a lack of bank accounts or integration into a formal financial system. Based on our assessment, we believe there are a number of ways in which to address these constraints. These include increasing Intermediariesʼ storage and processing capacities, aggregating their supply with other Intermediaries in order to meet the higher buyer thresholds, and supporting efforts in formalizing operations such as creating bank accounts, registering vehicles, and using electronic payment processes for streamlined invoicing. If Intermediaries were able to access these larger buyers, we believe that they could increase their monthly income by as much as 50% to 60%. There is great potential for expansion and market disruption, but given the varied capacities and levels of formalization that exist amongst Waste Picker Associations and Intermediaries, investment should be coupled with technical assistance both at the enterprise level and at the local and regional levels. For example, support in advocating for separation at source policies, arrangements with municipalities for collection routes, and increasing awareness of the importance of recycling are all necessary investments 24 that support the industry, and eventually the profitability, of these actors in this segment of the supply chain. Model for Success For more than a decade, Ciudad Saludable has worked to establish a new model for empowering highly successful social enterprises in Peruʼs recycling sector. Beginning at the bottom of the value chain, Ciudad Saludable has organized informal waste pickers into collectively managed recycling associations that generate employment and income for thousands of recyclers. At the top of the value chain, they have helped improve linkages between buyers and suppliers and promoted the social value and impact of recycling operators. Finally, at the heart of the value chain, they have launched a dynamic set of successful enterprises known as Centros de Acopio de Residuos Reciclables (CARRs) that offer a unique model for enabling actors that purchase and sell recyclable materials to maximize the regulatory, market, and technical opportunities and benefits of Peruʼs new recycling economy. 25 SECTION 2: INCLUSIVE RECYCLING MODELS CIUDAD SALUDABLE Ciudad Saludable is a Peruvian non-governmental organization (NGO) founded in 2002 with a mission to build healthy and inclusive cities. To achieve this, the organization proposes a model of environmental citizenship and sustainable management for the mitigation and adaptation to climate change from the inclusive recycling value chain. Their work is broken into three major programmatic areas: 1) inclusive recycling, 2) environmental education and communication, and 3) integral management of solid waste. CS was founded by the Peruvian environmental leader Albina Ruiz, who was inspired to work with waste pickers originally to address the social and economic deprivations of this community of more than 100,000 highly vulnerable people in Peru. Albina conceived of an organization that enabled workers at the bottom level of the waste management value chain so they could secure greater access to and income from higher, more complex levels. In addition, she saw the opportunity to empower these waste pickers to become stewards of a burgeoning environmental movement by playing a central role as recyclers (recicladores) in a locally led recycled waste management system. By linking the marginalized people who handle waste with a national environmental movement in search of solutions to waste management, CS created a highly innovative model that has become internationally recognized and replicated throughout the region. CS began its work to help address the systemic poverty, and by extension terrible living and health conditions, faced by Peruʼs waste pickers who survive on the collection and sale of recyclable waste found in open dumps and streets throughout the country. CS has organized thousands of Recyclers into informal and formal Associations of up to 50 members who work collectively to manage waste and strengthen their bargaining power as organized cooperatives. CS regularly relies on Association members who previously worked on dumps to help provide validation and build trust as they organize in new locations where local recyclers are not familiar with them and are often reticent. CS has a well-established set of tools and curricula to deploy in helping facilitate the transition of recyclers to associations and on to sustainable waste management enterprises. Over Figure 10: Ciudad Saludable Framework 26 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Figure 11: Association Growth per Year # of associations time, these Associations develop into more formal micro-enterprises, supplanting Intermediaries (acopiadores) and selling directly to higher level Marketers and Industries and Exporters at a better price and volume. CS innovated a new business model for these Associations through the negotiation of a legal framework that allowed recyclers to be integrated into the municipal waste management systems mandated by the national “waste picker” law. The new law enabled the waste picker Associations to service household and business selective waste collection needs in sections of the municipalities where the associations operate. This gives them exclusive and reliable access to recycled waste and a legitimacy afforded by the agreement with the municipality (for example, formalized Associations wear the municipal logo on their protective uniforms). In addition, municipalities work with Associations to secure low cost leases for space where the associations sort and store the collected recycled waste. Securing these spaces is the foundational step towards the recycler owned and operated Centro de Acopio de Residuos Reciclables (CARRs). In addition to enabling the enterprise success of recyclers, CS facilitates the provision of health services, labor protections, and social benefits afforded by right under the “waste-picker” law. To date, CS has organized over 11,500 recyclers into Associations that serve the recycled waste collection needs of thousands of individuals and households across Peru. Through these associations and the municipalities with whom they partner, CS has elevated the importance of recycling and the recycled waste value chain for millions of Peruvians. 27 To further enable the market for these recyclers and to advance the environmental movement that they support, CS also leads education, advocacy and public awareness programs in partnership with government, the private sector, and other stakeholders throughout Peru. These awareness campaigns help strengthen the waste management systems by changing behaviors around sustainability and trash; as more residents and businesses are targeted and learn about segregation programs and inclusive recycling, they are more likely to participate in recycling programs and, therefore, provide a steady supply of materials for waste pickers and CARRs. CS is a highly dynamic organization that operates on multiple levels, but the key components of their work include public engagement, organizing recyclers, technical assistance, health services, market facilitation, and policy and advocacy leadership. Each component is weighted and applied differently across each of their programmatic areas, but are equal pillars in an integrated organizational model that engages all actors in waste management and environmental stewardship in Peru. Since its founding in 2001, Ciudad Saludable has sensitized 9 million people in Latin America to the issues inherent in solid waste management through education and communications campaigns, trained 6,000 informal recyclers, formalized 11,500 recyclers in formal selective collection routes benefiting 5.6 million Peruvians, and Figure 12: Ciudad Saludable in Peru Figure 13: CARRs Operating in Lima 28 worked with more than 200 municipalities to improve solid waste management. With a desire for holistic engagement, a wide-reaching ability for community and government engagement, and technical expertise in solid waste management, Ciudad Saludable has created an innovative social enterprise model that addresses many of the challenges facing key actors in the recycling supply chain. Over the last ten years, Ciudad Saludable has established a uniquely successful model to empower highly successful social enterprises in the recycling sector. CENTROS DE ACOPIO DE RESIDUOS RECICLABLES (CARRs) Ciudad Saludableʼs Centros de Acopio de Residuos Reciclables (CARRs) are social enterprises that facilitate partnerships between Recycling Associations and municipal governments. In this approach, municipalities and waste pickers formally organize into Associations (Waste Picker Associations) and establish contracts or cooperation agreements for performing collection services and/or recycling. Once established as Associations and operating as CARRs, these Centers function as legally recognized microenterprises with significant opportunity for valorization. Through their recycling activities, they advance a culture of inclusive recycling by delivering comprehensive services that contribute to the incomes of waste pickers, deliver vital environmental services, provide materials for local industries, and generate sustainable livelihoods for low-income citizens. The CARRs also have the advantage of working with all actors in the supply chain – CARRs buy and store materials on behalf of recyclers, sell processed or unprocessed materials to Marketers, and engage directly with large industries such as San Miguel Industrias, S.A. and single-product Exporters and processors such as Siderperu, a Peruvian steel and iron company, for scrap metal and other products. CARRs broaden their sources of income by working with private and public sector partners and lower the overall costs of recycling for municipalities, as well as contribute to national competitiveness and environmental sustainability. Therefore, CARRs offer a hybrid model combining traditional roles previously carried out by multiple actors into one efficient and sustainable entity. The first CARR was established in 2011 and at present there are 35 CARRs operating across Peru. On average, a High Capacity CARR services 14,300 households, institutions, and companies and is actively engaged in Stages #2 (Recovery), #3 (Commercialization), and #4 (Conditioning). They collect and store an average of 850 tons per year, or 71 tons per month, and partner with between 1 to 10 Waste Picker Associations, thus providing reliable income to as many as 200 waste-workers. 29 OPPORTUNITY TO SCALE CARRs CARRs operate at varying levels of low and high capacity based on capacity for efficiencies in inventory management, processing, and sales. Each CARR follows a six-stage process in processing, storing, and selling the materials. Waste Picker Association members serve in a variety of different roles at the CARRs, including in the CARRʼs administrative offices handling sales, inventory, and relationships with private sector buyers and government actors, while others work exclusively on activities related to selective collection and processing, including as collection vehicle drivers, sorters, and processors. CARRs also provide Waste Picker Association members with technical trainings and have conference rooms used for meetings by Association management with buyers, locker rooms with showers for workers, and lunch spaces. Figure 14: CARR Operations “Low Capacity” CARRs operate with limited capacity for collection, small areas for material collection, storage, and segregation, and significantly fewer association-affiliated waste pickers. These CARRs have between 5 and 10 employees and are defined as enterprises earning up to $50,000 per year. These Centers often require upgraded equipment and enhanced infrastructure to grow their capacity and meet the needs of customers with greater efficiency and scale. 30 Figure 15: Photos of Low Capacity CARRs As shown above, low capacity CARRs lack storage units, advanced technology, and infrastructure to engage in higher volume collection and processing. For example, these Centers may require inventory management shifts from unorganized and unsorted recyclable waste to bagged and separated collection areas that improve productivity and efficiency, or upgraded equipment and enhanced infrastructure to grow their capacity and meet the needs of customers with greater efficiency and scale. In addition, low capacity CARRs work to design, expand, and implement residential and business routes for selective collection of recyclable waste. “High Capacity” CARRs operate with 10 to 100 employees, function more efficiently and utilize more modern technology, including defined areas of segregation and upgraded technologies to enhance collection and processing. High Capacity CARRs earn between $50,000 and $150,000 per year. These CARRs have invested in infrastructure upgrades, including adding or enhancing bathrooms, buying more collection vehicles, and investing in additional chippers, pressers, and segregation tables. In addition, High Capacity CARRs have successfully designed and implemented broader routes for selective collection of recyclable waste, working directly with the municipal governments to establish proper documentation and certification. 31 Figure 16: Photos of High Capacity CARRs At this point in the process, many of these enterprises are operating at a high enough capacity that they are operating as Marketers and have partnerships with large firms, such as bottling companies like San Miguel Industrias, the top bottling company in Latin America. These CARRs have agreements with local governments for official routes and services, thereby gaining access to long-term supplies of recyclable materials in residential and business neighborhoods. These partnerships guarantee a steady supply of recyclable materials and many firms have committed to continuing to work with Ciudad Saludable associations and increase their supply to the CARRs. As seen in the photos above, these CARRs have access to technology and infrastructure that ease the burdens around collection, storage, and processing, but still have room for growth through increased investment. Ultimately, CARRS at “high capacity” have the opportunity to take greater ownership of the market and optimize their services. As part of this assessment, we surveyed 4 Waste Picker Associations and 21 CARRs about their existing operations, challenges, and opportunities for expansion. The majority of those surveyed were Low Capacity CARRs with an average operating and Opportunity Spotlight – For both low and high capacity CARRs, there is a need for stronger infrastructure, access to upgraded and new technologies, access to capital, and improved buyer relationships. There are unique opportunities for both low and high capacity CARRs to capture a larger share of the market and become more competitive in Stage 3 (Commercialization), Stage 4 (Conditioning), and Stage 5 (Transformation) in the value chain. 32 - 1,000 2,000 3,000 4,000 5,000 6,000 7,000 Paperboard PET plastic White paper Plastic Fil Scrap Hard plastic Metal Newspaper Iron Magazines Cans Mixed paper Rubber Glass Cardboard PET white Steel PVC plastic Colored paper Mixed Fil PET Color Yogurt bottles Mixed Plastic Coated paper Other storage space of approximately 70 square meters, processed approximately 1.2 tons of recycled material per month, and employed 10 people. The primary materials collected and stored are Paperboard, PET Plastics, White Paper, Plastic Fil, and Scrap. Of the 16 CARRs surveyed, they collectively process approximately 34,900 kilograms per day. Based on a financial analysis of their operations, their annual income ranges between $35,000 and $150,000 per year. The Associations and CARRs surveyed highlighted the challenges often associated with Intermediaries. Figure 17: Materials Processed Per Day of Surveyed CARRs, Kilograms Most CARRs surveyed operate within the Commercialization Stage (#3) of the supply chain, limiting their operations to the purchase, storage, and sale of recycled materials. While some CARRs do some types of conditioning such as cleaning or pressing (Stage #4) and others take part in the Transformation Stage (#5) such as chopping of PET materials, the majority remain engaged in Commercialization Stage (#3) of the supply chain. A common reason for their lack of engagement in Stage #4 and Stage #5 is due to their small size and limited financial and business capacity. For example, many CARRs operate with very minimal working capital. With such low working capital balances, it is clear that they have little ability to plan for unexpected expenditures, save for future growth including moving to large locations or purchasing equipment, or even sufficiently manage daily operations. With a slightly higher working capital balance, they would have the flexibility to ride out market price fluctuations by choosing to store their recyclable material for longer periods of time rather than having to sell them 33 immediately in order to keep operations moving. Furthermore, many have limited avenues in which to address this constraint, as most have not accessed formal credit mechanisms. The reasons cited for not pursuing bank loans were a lack of familiarity with the banking system and how to engage in it, limited use of bank accounts, and for those that do not own their properties, a lack of collateral to secure financing. Of those surveyed, only 7 CARRs – all in Lima – have accessed a bank account. With limited financial flexibility, these entities are stuck in their current state of operations – unable to store more material, even if they could collect it, unable to process material because they do not have the financing to purchase the needed equipment, and unable to secure higher price points for their materials because they cannot generate the volume needed to partner with the larger Marketers and Industries or Exporters. That being said, it is clear that they have the potential to address all of these constraints and are primed to do so with the right package of investment, technical assistance, and market access. For example, based on our analysis, a typical press has a production capacity of 768 bales per month, which would generate an output of approximately 50 tons per month of PET – significantly expanding these Associations and CARRs current production capacity. With the pre-pressed materials, they could now sell the PET at 1.70 soles/kilo compared to 1.04 soles/kilo of the unpressed plastic. The cost of energy, labor, and machine depreciation would be approximately 0.30 soles/kilo resulting in an additional gain of 0.40 soles/kilo. An average CARR stores approximately 47,000 kilos of PET per month, resulting in an increase in monthly income of as much as 19,000 soles ($5,800). Another example is the conditioning of hard plastic by washing and drying it. Unprocessed hard plastic sells for approximately 1.26 soles/kilo whereas once it has been washed and dried, it can be sold for around 2.60 soles/kilo, more than doubling the price. Additional conditioning processes include chopping, grinding, and packing recyclable material all of which can result in larger portions of the value chain being captured by CARRs. 34 Figure 18: Constraints to and Opportunities for CARR Growth Goals Practical Challenges Solutions Increase Supply of Collected Material Increase Processing Volume Increase Processing Capacity Strengthen Relationships with Buyers More Favorable Buyer Contracts Inadequate Facility Space - Larger spaces - More efficient layouts, - Dedicated spaces for processing stages such as storage areas, unloading areas, and separation workspaces, - Improved working conditions including bathrooms and locker rooms Insufficient Storage Infrastructure - Stacking and modular containers - Scaffolding and ladders - More efficient layouts - Equipment to condense size of materials (i.e. pressing, grinding, compacting, etc.) Insufficient Technologies - Vehicles (i.e. trucks, scooters, and motofurgones) for expanded collection capacity - Processing equipment (i.e. pressers, washers, shredders, compactors, segregation tables, carts, and scales) - Office equipment (i.e. desks, computers, printers, smart phones, Internet access) - Digital Financial and Payment Systems - Bank Accounts - Computers for Electronic Records Inadequate Safety Equipment - Protective uniforms, including masks, gloves, boots, and aprons - Trainings on how to use safety equipment and its importance Weak or Insufficient Technical Capacity - Technical training and assistance on new technologies, business management, government engagement, marketing and buyer relationships, and safety procedures for complex materials Insufficient Working Capital - Bank Accounts - Financing Insufficient Volumes and Quality for Large Buyers - Pool collected materials with other CARRs to increase volumes - Vehicles for expanded collection capacity - Large physical spaces - Efficient use of existing spaces - Technical trainings on processing including proper sorting techniques and equipment operation - Vehicle licensing and registration (for transport to buyers) 35 More broadly speaking, Associations and Low Capacity CARRs are unable to capture a larger share of the value chain and position themselves for growth. The various stages of professionalism influence their sustainability and dependency as legitimate actors in the value chain as purchasers seeking to work with formal, professionalized enterprises with a high capacity to meet demand and increase the value of the recyclable product. As supply continues to increase and the demand for recycling and recyclable materials grows, CARRs face the opportunity to meet the discrepancy between collected recyclable materials and the market head on. Many CARRs rent machinery and equipment for sorting and processing recyclable materials for several years, an expensive and labor-intensive process. Investments in basic technologies to maintain activity and in new equipment that handles more diverse materials, such as conveyor belts, hydraulic presses, and automatic compactors, broadens the economic activity and sustainability of the CARR. Formalizing their operations by creating bank accounts, digitizing financial records, and creating electronic invoicing system strengthens their management practices, increases efficiencies, and positions them to access financing and larger buyers who operate exclusively with online payment systems. CARRs operating at a higher capacity also have room for growth and improvements through linkages to larger buyers, expanded collection routes and processing capacities, and improved business management practices. The opportunity to meet market demand is within reach. Opportunity Spotlight – Both Low and High Capacity CARRs serve a critical role in formalizing and professionalizing both the Recycler and Intermediary segment of the recycling value chain. With the right combination of targeted investment, technical assistance, and market facilitation, Low Capacity CARRs have the potential to scale up to High Capacity CARRs, thus capturing larger portions of the value chain. High Capacity CARRs have an opportunity to expand their reach, partner with larger and more professional buyers, and continue to grow the profitability of their enterprises. 36 • Organizing • Training • Basic Investment Informal Waste Pickers • Technical Assistance • Municipal Partnerships and Routes • Established Infrastructure Low Capacity CARR • Technology to Meet Minimum Market Demand • Enhanced Infrastructure • High Capacity Training High Capacity CARR Opportunity to Maximize Growth OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE CARRS In addition to enabling the growth of existing CARRs, there is an opportunity to invest in and develop new Collection Centers. The development of new CARRs shifts the formalization of the waste management system one step closer to meeting and strengthening market demand, finishing the circular economy, and strengthening the waste management sector as a whole. Associations entering the market seek to professionalize and diversify activity at the base of the Pyramid, and require robust infrastructure, equipment and technology, and training and leadership to achieve economic activity and develop into sustainable microenterprises. Figure 19: CARR Lifecycle The shift from informal recycling to becoming part of the formalized, collector tier begins with the recruitment and organization of at least five informal waste pickers working at dumps and in public spaces, into Waste Picker Associations with formal leadership structures, management processes, and government recognition. Informal recyclers are drawn from poor and vulnerable sectors of society seeking the relatively easy, albeit hazardous, access to waste and the immediate value associated with its sale. With poor opportunities and insufficient earnings, informal pickers are unrecognized and unprotected actors in the waste management system – despite playing an obvious, critical role in the market. During the formalization process, Associations are trained to meet the requirements established by Law 29419 as well as municipal and district requirements. In addition, the formalization process addresses personal, familial, health and other challenges workers face, as well as the governance and organizational capacity necessary to run a successful recycling microenterprise and link with secondary value chain actors, including sourcing agents, recycling companies, and exporting firms. Once formalized and licensed by the government, each Recycling Association is linked to a Collection Center, or CARR, that handles collection management, storage, and 37 separation of products. The lifecycle of onboarding new CARRs begins with the transition of informal waste pickers into organized associations that grow into financially sustainable businesses and moves through a certification process regulated by the municipal government. On average, it takes 2 months and a minimum working capital of $400 USD to formalize and certify a Waste Picker Association. One of the main benefits of becoming a formally registered Association is the possibility of entering into agreements or contracts for recycling programs and routes that include participating households or businesses that implement separation at source waste disposal. The breakdown of goods in households, commercial offices, factories, and public waste bins, raises the productivity and incomes of waste pickers. This linkage not only expands the window of business opportunities and social inclusion for the recyclers, but also adds value to recovered waste and strengthens the recycling and waste market. Furthermore, after the formalization and licensing process, Centers gain access to funds from Peruʼs Fondo de Garantía Empresarial (Entrepreneurial Fund, or FOGEM) and the ability to participate in the export market. As a critical economic group in the recycling chain, waste pickersʼ activity has substantial economic impact that is currently being lost. Incorporating informal waste pickers into the waste management and recycling system enables the expansion of Peruʼs recycling sector and presents the opportunity for Peru to overcome the discrepancy between formal collection and informal activity, as well as empower marginalized workers. In partnership with governments, the municipality provides the regulatory and legal framework for operation while waste pickers provide labor. Strengthening and formalizing the capacity to link to private and public sources is intricately linked to long-term sustainability of these enterprises; through partnerships with local governments and firms, the CARRs are recognized as formal entities operating in the waste management sector and have agreements with local governments for official routes and services, therefore gaining access to long-term supplies of recyclable materials in residential and business neighborhoods. In addition, by formalizing and organizing into associations or cooperatives, waste pickers secure economic enfranchisement, social benefits, and gain more equitable participation in the market. Similar to “low capacity” CARRs, these Associations require an infusion of both working capital and technical assistance to strengthen the culture of recycling, while enhancing the capabilities of their members by providing them with the technical knowledge and access to succeed. For an Association to grow into a sustainable Intermediary-level microenterprise that handles high-level and high-volume collection, storage, processing, and/or transformation, workers must have the technical expertise on health and sanitation, inclusive recycling, and business management practices. In addition to 38 Opportunity Spotlight – Given the untapped supply of recyclable materials, the creation of new CARRs enables inclusive economic growth for informal waste pickers and transitions them into formal Associations operating high functioning social enterprises. With its grassroots nature, minimal investment requirements, and established model, the creation of new CARRs is an extremely viable opportunity to expand the number of profitable, small and medium enterprises in the recycling sector. technical skills, workers require personal protection equipment to not only protect the recyclers from the innate hazards of their work, but also help add creditability and legitimacy through the uniformity and professionalism of the equipment. Other activities, such as creating linkages with local governments to help recyclers access existing public health services and government programs such as Seguro Integral de Salud (SIS), Peruʼs public health system, and Pensión 65, the state-run pension program, empower the recyclers with the necessary resources and skills to work with dignity and embeds their work in a formal, organized labor sector with public and private support. 39 SECTION 3: OPPORTUNITY LANDSCAPE In recent years, authorities at the local and national levels within various countries across Latin America have experienced growing concerns over how they can undertake integrated waste management with a focus on sustainability and social and economic inclusion. The growing commitment to green city management in Latin America is driven by policy priorities related to the social, health, and environmental impacts of high urbanization rates and renewed social responsibility practices. Over the last ten years, in efforts to keep pace with rapid expansion, cities across the region have moved to strengthen waste management to optimize growth patterns. Despite this, recycling is still limited, with less than 3% of solid waste generated in Latin America separated at the source and recycled. Recycling activities performed by informal waste pickers – the majority of whom are poor and socially marginalized – are responsible for up to 90% of the recyclable waste recovered from the waste stream. Informal recycling has become an employment opportunity for thousands of people operating at varying tiers of the recycling actors pyramid. Despite their importance in the value chain, they face numerous obstacles to growth and professionalization. Across the region, common challenges for Recyclers range from dangerous working conditions and lack of access to social and health services, inadequate access to financial services, as well as legitimacy, and inconsistent volume collection – and thus, earnings. These constraints carry over to other tiers of actors, including Intermediaries, who are similarly hampered from growth due to informal operations, inconsistent supplies, and a lack of investment. In response to these challenges and building upon a regional commitment to social and economic development and environmental sustainability, countries such as Peru, Colombia, and Brazil have developed inclusive policies and legal frameworks to drive the implementation of integrated and inclusive sustainable waste management systems. These frameworks aim to not only recognize the entire recycling value chain and waste management sector, but also empower key stakeholders including recyclers, municipalities, and firms to create efficient, responsible recycling systems. OPPORTUNITIES OVERVIEW For the purposes of this report, GFI and Ciudad Saludable assessed the multiple programs, priorities, and market machinations associated with the formalization process and the micro and small recycling enterprises within the recycling value chain. The goal 40 of this assessment process was to identify opportunities to significantly expand market and enterprise growth in the recycled waste value chain. From this assessment, three areas of opportunity were identified to engage the sector and launch, formalize, and further capacitate key market actors and enterprises. Each opportunity may be considered independently, but there are links between each, and combined they represent a significant chance to transform waste management system in Peru to a truly integrated locally owned, market-oriented system. Opportunity 1: Formalize Recyclers Given that the majority of Peruʼs more than 109,000 recyclers are informal workers, there is a clear opportunity to expand engagement with these actors to integrate them into the formal waste management framework. Recyclers are already entrenched in the recycling value chain of Peru, providing a key first link in the chain of recycled waste moving from dumps to Intermediaries, Marketers, and Industries and Exporters. In some municipalities, Recyclers represent one of the only providers of recycled waste collection, but they still operate at the margins and in deplorable conditions despite this key role. For Recyclers, the primary opportunity is to support their formalization into Waste Picker Associations, which can operate as micro-enterprises. The formalization process recruits informal waste pickers and addresses personal, familial, health and other challenges workers face, as well as the governance and organizational capacity necessary to run a successful micro-recycling enterprise. These Associations are linked with secondary value chain actors, including sourcing agents, recycling companies, and exporting firms. As formal workers, they are able to access healthcare and social security as well as participate in vaccination programs run by government agencies. There is also a unique opportunity to strengthen financial inclusion of Associations and their Members, the majority of whom are unbanked and rely on cash transactions. Overcoming this challenge early, coupled with financial literacy training, can lead to improved management of personal finances including increases in savings and planning for future expenses for Members as well as improved financial management, capital accumulation, and expanded investments for the enterprises. Opportunity 2) Invest in Recycling Enterprises (CARRs) Over time, the formalized Waste Picker Associations develop into higher function enterprises called Centros de Acopio de Residuos Reciclables (CARRs). These Centers function as legally recognized micro-enterprises with significant opportunity for valorization. Section Two of this report provided a detailed overview on the CARR model, but in summary, CARRs are innovative social enterprises that advance a culture 41 of inclusive recycling by delivering comprehensive services that contribute to the incomes of waste pickers, deliver vital environmental services, provide materials for local industries, and generate sustainable livelihoods for low-income citizens. CARRs are able to go beyond the storage of collected materials and take part in various stages or processing such as pressing, washing, chopping, thus capturing larger portions of the value chain and selling to Marketers, Industries, and Exporters at higher prices and larger volumes. Given the innovative and inclusive model of CARRs, there is significant opportunity to expand the CARR model. Ciudad Saludable has launched approximately 35 CARRs over the past ten years with each social enterprise able to service as many 14,300 households, collect as much as 70 tons per month, and provide incomes to as many as 200 waste pickers. While each enterprise can operate with a significant footprint, there is room to grow the existing capacity of the CARRs. For example, investments around organizing waste pickers and expanding collection routes of Associations will increase the supply of collected materials while also establishing a reliable income for waste-pickers. Investments and technical assistance to improve the capacity and efficiency in the collection, treatment, and business management of the CARRs will help increase processing volume, reduce costs, and increase sale prices. In addition, stronger financial inclusion of CARRs coupled with improved financial management practices and technologies can help improve efficiencies, financial planning, and access to financial services. Finally, strengthening the link to private and public sources is intricately linked to long-term sustainability of the CARRs. Partnerships with municipalities create reliable sources of supply while providing value services to the community and an income for the waste-pickers. Direct linkages and strong buyer relationships with Marketers, Industries, and Exporters provide diverse sources of income for the enterprises as well as opportunities for collaboration such as buyer investment in appropriate technologies so the CARRs are better positioned to meet their needs. In addition to investments in the existing CARRs, there is significant room for expansion of the CARR model. The majority of CARRs operate in and around the suburbs of Lima, however, the model is not restricted to those geographic areas and could easily be applied across Peru as well as the region more broadly. Opportunity 3) – Engaging Intermediaries Approximately 90% of the supply chain is represented by Recyclers and Intermediaries. Despite the significant volume processed by these actors, the overwhelming majority of both Recyclers and Intermediaries in Peru operate informally and at a relatively small scale. This has limited their ability to take advantage of the growth of the recycling 42 sector, including selling larger quantities to buyers and capturing additional parts of the value chain. There are over 13,000 Intermediaries, the majority of which are informal enterprises that trade in the market of recycled waste and operate in municipalities throughout Peru. They tend to operate on the fringes of the value chain and are often considered predatory in their treatment of waste pickers and furtive in the operation of their businesses, but they are also entrenched in the recycling sector. Intermediaries can be found in nearly every municipality in Peru and most have been working in the recyclable waste sector for multiple generations. Most are microenterprises that store and trade materials that have been collected by waste pickers or dropped at their facilities by households or businesses. They tend to work on a cash basis and on a slim margin, and many supplement their income from their recycling enterprises with other work. These enterprises have similarities to low-capacity CARRs in terms of their facilities, their operations, and the markets they engage. However, they lack the advantages CARRs have secured through partnerships with municipalities and the market facilitation led by CS. By targeting locations that are not currently served by CS associations, and where municipal buy-in is high, there is an opportunity to capacitate Intermediaries and integrate them into a tailored municipal waste management scheme highlighted in the CARR model. Leveraging market opportunities to organize Intermediaries has already proven effective in at least a handful of efforts CS has led. In one highly successful example, CS organized a set of Intermediaries working in scrap metal to collectively sell to Siderperu, a subsidiary of the Brazilian transnational steel company Gerdau. Each of the independent scrap collectors were required to organize into registered micro and small enterprises (MYPE) to facilitate the agreement, which in turn required them to comply with labor provisions and occupational health and safety requirements. Using this model, CS successfully organized 36 independent MYPEs capable of operating with some of the advantages CS has enabled for CARRs. In summary, because of the potential for growth, all three groups of actors identified – Recyclers, CARRs, and Intermediaries – are well positioned to be formalized and capacitated through the right combination of investment, technical assistance, and market facilitation to help them overcome the constraints that have limited their size and growth potential. Empowering these tiers of actors in the value chain is critical to supporting inclusion, improving working conditions and decent work, and strengthening the sector overall. 43 CONCLUSION In its 15 years of work, Ciudad Saludable has demonstrated an unprecedented capacity to generate progress with diverse stakeholders, ranging from informal waste pickers, to government and the market actors at all levels of the recycled waste value chain. Their model and innovative interventions have proven highly adaptable to local conditions and context, but securely integrated into the larger market and regulatory framework in which they operate. As a result, they have earned international recognition for their work and are highly regarded for their leadership and guidance within Peru and throughout Latin America. In Peru, their advocacy, education programs and public engagement have reached an estimated 9.5 million Peruvians directly or indirectly. Through the regulatory reforms they helped write and pass, they have established a model for locally-led solid waste collection and environmental stewardship that impacts the country as a whole. Through this model, they have organized over 11,500 recyclers into independent associations and enterprises and have launched 35 profit-making, collectively owned microenterprises servicing hundreds of thousands of households and businesses in Peru. These impeccable credentials and proven experience have positioned CS to launch a new phase of work aimed at transforming the value chain for recyclable waste in Peru. Only 14% percent of waste is recycled in Peru and merely a small percentage of recyclable waste is collected from households and business annually, yet the domestic market for recyclable waste grows each year. These conditions point to an opportunity to expand the CS model and engage informal market actors including waste pickers and Intermediaries who are positioned to operate within the municipal waste collection framework CS has created. By building on CSʼs successful model of inclusive recycling, formalizing micro enterprises, and expanding market access, there is a meaningful opportunity to transform the waste management sector in Peru. 44 REFERENCES Center for Clean Air Policy.
