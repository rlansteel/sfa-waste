Although there are efforts to promote this infrastructure, coverage is still limited, and its distribution does not always respond to the needs of the different regions. This, added to the lack of environmental awareness and local capacity to efficiently manage these points, makes it difficult to achieve an adequate plastic waste management system [...] In Peru, one of the main challenges in collecting waste-related data is linked to the quality of the information reported. Many municipalities and actors responsible for waste management face difficulties in collecting, processing and reporting consistent and reliable data due to technical, financial and human capacity limitations.

In December 2017, its Regulations were approved by Supreme Decree No. 014-2017-MINAM, and amended by Supreme Decree No. 001-2022-MINAM. The LGIRS recognizes the circular economy, extended producer responsibility, and the valorization of solid waste as principles in the comprehensive management of solid waste. It also indicates that the MINAM is responsible for promoting public and private, municipal and non-municipal initiatives that contribute to the reduction of the generation and danger, valorization, and proper management of solid waste, including plastic waste. It should be noted that, under the current framework, the primary purpose of waste management is to prevent or minimize its generation at source. Secondly, the valorization and material and energy recovery of waste is prioritized.\n\nLaw No. 30884 “Law Regulating Single-Use and Disposable Plastic Containers or Packaging”\nLaw No. 30884 was approved on December 19, 2018. The Regulations of Law No. 30884 were approved on August 23, 2019 by Supreme Decree No. 006-2019-MINAM. Both regulatory instruments aim to ensure that the consumption and production of single-use plastic goods migrate to reusable, recyclable or biodegradable plastic goods in order to transition to a circular plastic economy. This Law is framed within the principles and guidelines established in the LGIRS, especially with regard to the minimization, valorization and promotion of the circular economy, which will ultimately contribute to reducing the adverse impact on health and the environment due to the superfluous use of single-use plastic.\n\nSupreme Decree No. 003-2020-PRODUCE, which establishes the \"Roadmap towards a circular economy in the industrial sector\", was approved in 2020 by the President of Peru. This roadmap is a legal instrument that seeks to promote and facilitate the adoption of circular economy models in the value chains of the industrial sector, allowing:\n\nLikewise, Supreme Decree No. 011-2023-PRODUCE establishes the \"Roadmap towards a circular economy in the fishing and aquaculture subsectors\", promoting a sustainable approach in these key sectors. This roadmap defines concrete actions, deadlines, those responsible, actors involved and progress indicators, aimed at ensuring that the fishing and aquaculture subsectors achieve a fair transition towards a circular economy by 2030.\n\nLikewise, Supreme Decree No. 007-2024-VIVIENDA approves the “Roadmap towards a circular economy in drinking water and sanitation by 2030”, promoting sustainable and circular practices in the drinking water and sanitation sectors.\n\n■ In Preparation\nName:\n\nBrief description:\nMinisterial Resolution No. 0189-2021-MIDAGRI “Roadmap towards a Circular Economy in the Agricultural and Irrigation Sector”. Publication of the project. The project was published in July 2021 in order to receive opinions, comments and/or suggestions from public and private entities and the general public. The roadmap calls for adopting a circular economy approach in production chains, to ensure the efficient use and sustainable use of products, in the processes of production, harvesting, processing, transformation and distribution.\n\nMinisterial Resolution No. 0351-2023-MINAM “ National Roadmap for Circular Economy to 2030 ”. Publication of the project. The project was published in November 2023 in order to receive opinions, comments and/or suggestions from public and private entities and the general public. This roadmap is an instrument for planning and guiding the policies, standards and practices of economic activities at the sectoral and territorial level for a fair, effective, coherent and coordinated transition of Peru towards a circular economy.\n\nIndicators and/or Targets\n\n■ Plastic recycling:\nIndicators:\n\nBrief description:\nWithin the framework of DS No. 001-2022-MINAM, district and provincial municipalities report information on the management and handling of solid waste through the Sigersol Municipal platform.

The objective is to adapt Black Solider Fly (BSF) insect technology, which is already a proven waste treatment solution in other regions of the world, to the local context by means of a scalable concept of insect farms.\nThe by-products of organic waste treatment are highly demanded commodities, and their production will contribute to the sustainable transformation of the agricultural sector. In addition, the protein products of BSF insect farms are high-value animal feed. Separate organic waste collection is not common in Latin America, and more than 95% of municipal organic waste is landfilled or ends up in open dumpsites and causes negative environmental impacts like methane emission, leakage, and air pollution. Separate collection of organic waste and its adequate treatment, for example through composting, has shown to be difficult to implement due to local restrictions, the lack of markets for the by-products, and other reasons. Composting is rarely a cost-competitive solution, and subsidies hardly exist for such projects.\nWork carried out under this project supports the methane emissions reduction target from poorly managed landfills set in Peru's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC).\nProject reference: Peru: linking waste management and protein production through insect technology [PE-21-001]\nObjectives\n\nDiversion of organic waste towards a BSF insect protein treatment plant instead of landfilling without treatment\nMore investment channeled towards BSF insect technology projects as a sustainable and profitable alternative for organic waste management\nEmpowerment and capacity building of public entities, municipalities, and other key stakeholders relevant to the solid waste sector to use the BSF insect technology\n\nWHY WE'RE DOING THIS WORK\nLatin America is one of the most urbanized regions in the world, with approximately 81% of the population living in cities. For many reasons, management of the organic waste stream from municipal solid waste in Latin America is almost non-existent except for some composting projects. Absence of separation of waste at source has been one of the main challenges in the region. In the city of Lima, solid waste in its majority is sent to landfills, and recycling is conducted in an informal way for the most valuable waste fractions. The situation is similar for the district of Independencia in Lima.\nThe anaerobic decomposition of organic waste generates methane. Organic waste is a substantial percentage of the municipal waste in developing countries. In the district of Independencia, about 54% of the waste is comprised of the organic fraction, and all waste is disposed of at the sanitary landfill \"El Zapallal\" located in the north of Lima city.\nThe treatment of organic waste is costly, and most options are not seen as profitable solutions for biowaste management. In many countries, organic waste is dumped in open dumps and rudimentary landfills. The practice of organic waste diversion is not common, which makes it necessary to demonstrate that diverting organic waste from landfills for its valorization is key to reducing methane from the waste sector.\nThe proof of economic viability (independent from subsidies) in this project will be a game changer for organic waste treatment in the region. Due to the high percentage of organic waste in MSW (>50%) in the region, the impact for the reduction of methane, a greenhouse gas, will be remarkably high. The development of these farms will take place in Latin American cities. The cities in the region have similar characteristics and waste management systems, which is why the proposed solution, to be developed for the district of Independencia in Lima, Peru, will be easily replicable in other cities of Latin America.\nWhat We're Doing\n\nCompile information on the current organic waste streams and treatment practices of nine municipalities (part of the commonwealth of Lima Norte) and create a baseline report, which will include the current SLCP waste emission estimates of the area. \nDevelop a concept design for modular scalable insect (Black Soldier Fly) technology plant for the treatment of organic waste in the target area. \nAssess the technical and economic feasibility of the insect technology plant for the treatment of organic waste.  \nConduct training for decision makers and local experts performed on the findings of the feasibility study. \nDevelop two training kits, one to spread know-how regarding the capabilities of insect technology and another on how best to implement an organic waste treatment solution based on insect technology. Conduct capacity building sessions using the training kits.\nDevelop digital communication material about BSF technology, the feasibility study and its results and their dissemination through online platforms. \n\nProject updates\n\nProject update\nWaste\n2024\nCCAC Case Study: Linking Waste Management and Protein Production Through Insect Technology\n\nProject update\nWaste\n2023\nUp-Cycling Lima's Organic Waste with Black Soldier Fly Technology\n\nProject update\nWaste\n2021\nInspired by Chile’s National Organic Waste Strategy, Peru Aims to Transform the Sector\n\nFooter menu\n\nAbout SLCPs\nShort-lived climate pollutants\nSector solutions\nBenefits of action\n\n\nWho we are\nAbout us\nOur partners\nOur hubs\n\n\nOur work\nOur approach\nProject funding\nTechnical assistance services\n\n\nTools & resources\nCCAC assessments\nResource library\nPolicy database\n\n\nNews & events\nGlobal initiatives\nMedia resources\nNews & updates\nNewsletter\nEvents & meetings\n\n\n\nThis website is managed by the CCAC Secretariat and is hosted by the UN Environment Programme.

The publication of the PMMRS content had been put on hold by the Ministry of Environment since 2017, with the issuance of the Regulation of Legislative Decree No. 1278, approving the Law on Integrated Solid Waste Management.\nThe PMMRS aims to prevent or minimize the generation of solid waste to ensure an efficient use of resources, inputs and materials, promoting the transition to a circular economy and to proper management and handling of solid waste.\nThe plan has 13 sections. Among the main ones are the following:\n\nIdentification of the sources of solid waste generation\nPrevention and/or minimization strategy\nManagement and handling of solid waste\nDescription of environmental measures\nEmergency response measures\nDiscard material, among others\n\nThis regulation is applicable both for the sectorial and environmental authorities, as well as for the owners of projects or activities, in the elaboration of environmental studies and complementary environmental management instruments.\nIt should be noted that the information contained in the PMMRS must be consistent with what the generator of non-municipal solid waste will include in the Annual Declaration of Non-Municipal Solid Waste, as well as in the Manifests of Hazardous Solid Waste.\nWe hope that this information will be of relevance to you and your company.

Alarmingly, nearly half—around 49%—was improperly managed, ending up in Areas Degraded by Municipal Solid Waste (ADRSM), polluting water bodies and soils, or being openly burned. This growing challenge poses serious risks to ecosystems, public health, and the country’s progress toward sustainable development.\nOver the years, Peru has taken important steps to address the issue. Law No. 30884, enacted in 2018, introduced regulations on single-use plastics and disposable containers. Prior to that, Law No. 29419 (2017) formally recognized the role of waste pickers as key actors in waste management. Despite these advances, plastic pollution remains a persistent problem, highlighting the need for more coordinated, inclusive, and scalable action. \nPeru Joins the Global Plastic Action Partnership\nIn 2023, the Ministry of the Environment (MINAM) and the World Economic Forum signed a memorandum of understanding to officially integrate Peru into the Global Plastic Action Partnership (GPAP).\nAs part of this commitment, the National Plastic Action Partnership (NPAP) Peru was established as a multi-stakeholder platform that brings together the government, private sector, civil society, international organizations, and academia. ### The National Plastic Action Partnership Peru\nNPAP Peru aims to accelerate the country’s transition to a circular economy for plastics by fostering knowledge sharing, promoting best practices, and driving impactful action.\nThis platform marks a new chapter in Peru’s fight against plastic pollution: one rooted in collective action, innovation, and shared responsibility - ensuring that the transition is inclusive and benefits all, leaving no one behind. \n \nGovernance: The Steering Board\nIn 2024, as NPAP Peru celebrates its first year of implementation, it has built a strong and inclusive governance structure. The Steering Board — the platform’s highest decision-making body — is made up of 15 organizations, providing strategic direction and ensuring broad representation across Peru’s plastics value chain.\nGovernment\n\nMinistry of the Environment \nMinistry of Production\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs\n\nPrivate Sector\n\nNestlé \nAJE Group\nNational Society of Industries \nPeruvian Association of the Non-Alcoholic Beverage and Soft Drink Industry \nPeruvian Association of the Plastics Industry\n\nCivil Society\n\nPeruvian Society for Environmental Law\n“Recíclame Perú” Civil Association \nNational Federation of Recyclers of Peru \nWWF Perú\n\nInternational Organizations\n\nBritish Embassy Lima\nDelegation of the European Union to Peru\n\nAcademia\nUniversidad Nacional Agraria La Molina\nMulti-stakeholder Participation\nSince its launch, NPAP Peru has actively fostered multi-stakeholder engagement through two dedicated task forces, bringing together over 55 organizations.\nThese groups have contributed to the development of key knowledge products, including the Baseline Analysis of the Plastic System in Peru, Scenario Modeling to 2040, a study on flexible plastics, and the Gender Equity and Social Inclusion Analysis of the Plastics Value Chain in Peru.\n\nMetrics\nTask Force\nA technical group of local experts providing specialized insights on plastic management in Peru.\n\nGender Equality and Social Inclusion (GESI) Task Force\nA social focus group that supports and validates the GESI analysis, through an inclusive, context-specific lens.\n2023\nSeptember | Peru joining GPAP\nSigning of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Ministry of the Environment and the World Economic Forum.\n2024\nJune | NPAP Peru\nOfficial launch of the National Plastic Action Partnership (NPAP) Peru.\nAugust | Steering Board\nEstablishment of the National Plastic Action Partnership Steering Board.\n2025\nMarch | GESI study\nPresentation of the Gender Equity and Social Inclusion Analysis of the Plastics Value Chain in Peru.\nMarch | Circular Plastic Festival\nA celebration of innovation and sustainability. ____________________\n\nGender Equity and Social Inclusion Analysis of the Plastics Value Chain in Peru\nThis report explores gender equity and social inclusion (GESI) across Peru’s plastics value chain, highlighting how plastic pollution disproportionately affects select groups, including women, informal waste workers, and rural communities.\nRead here\n\nLet's Connect\nDo you work for a government, business, intergovernmental organization, or civil society?

SW has an environmental impact, which increases as urban\nareas grow and time progresses. Poor SW management facilitates the deterioration of green\nareas, leaving society at greater risk [\n3\n,\n4\n]. The projection for 2050 estimates an increase\nof 3.05 billion tons of total waste per year, a value much higher than that of 2016, with a\ntotal of 2.01 billion tons [\n5\n,\n6\n]. However, organic waste is projected to decrease from 49 to\n37 percent [5,7,8].\nGiven this context, decision making to appropriately redirect industrialization and\nurbanization to prevent the explosive growth of SW is inevitable [\n9\n,\n10\n]. For Latin America\nor other continents, sustainable management strategies can help recover and sustain green\nareas, thereby recovering urban ecosystems [\n11\n,\n12\n]. In this sense, there is a need to design\nprotocols together with parallel processes that provide alternative waste management\npolicies or complement existing techniques, such as low-cost composting or other more\nexpensive strategies such as incineration, pyrolysis and gasiﬁcation, among others [\n13\n,\n14\n].\nRecent studies show how solid waste is potentially a usable energy source accord-\ning to SW management and mitigation methodologies within the context of a circular\neconomy [\n15\n,\n16\n], as is the case in the region of Guangdong, China, where municipal urban\nAppl. Sci. 2023,13, 1646. https://doi.org/10.3390/app13031646 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/applsci\n\nAppl. Sci. 2023,13, 1646 2 of 18\nwaste and other residues, such as manure from farms, can be recycled using properly\nefﬁcient waste disposal methods [17,18].\nIn Latin America, solid waste management techniques seek to maintain an acceptable\nmargin for public health, since the degree of environmental impact is undeniably linked\nto poor waste management or urban arrangements [\n19\n–\n21\n]. On the other hand, highly\ndeveloped countries generally have well-developed systems for proper waste management,\nwhich directly impacts the economy, as well as the environment [\n22\n,\n23\n]. Peru, as well\nas other developing countries, tends to prioritize urban growth, which leaves a gap in\nsolid waste management due to the rapid urban changes accompanying the growth of\ncities [24,25].\nIn Peru, the generation of organic SW from domestic use has varied, partially as a result\nof precautions taken during the COVID-19 pandemic, which is an indicator of promptly\ndisposing of products to avoid affecting the health of residents [\n26\n–\n28\n]. In Ayacucho, Peru,\npossible SW management and mitigation measures are being evaluated due to the impact of\nCOVID-19 [\n29\n]. Ayacucho is characterized by having limited resources and access together\nwith a population distributed in rural and urban areas for both agricultural and typical\nurban activities [\n30\n]. Among the communities that stand out for the generation of waste is\nOccochaca, in the District of Huanta, where inadequate SW management led to outbreaks\nof hepatitis and anemia [\n31\n]. Close to Occochaca, is the populated center of Sacsamarca,\nHuancasancos province, with cases of gastrointestinal disorders, respiratory difﬁculties\nand notorious impact on livestock due to SW distributed and inadequately managed in\nthe area [\n32\n]. In this sense, the set of factors that inﬂuence SW generation are the object of\nstudy in order to develop SW mitigation policies and procedures that make continuous\ndevelopment and prosperous urban growth possible. Given these reasons, the present\nstudy proposes generating appropriate organic SW management policies and systems\nto obtain a better understanding and extension of each of the sub-stages involved in the\nDistrict of Santa Rosa, Ayacucho. The considerations are detailed below, as well as the set\nof protocols structured in the following order:\n•\nThe present study proposes to structure a set of methodological sequences to describe,\nquantify and segregate all organic SW generated as a product of urban consumption\nand design a mitigation plan.\n•\nUsing as a basis the approach developed by Kunitoshi [\n33\n], we develop a series of\nmitigation steps outlined in the literature that are sequentially ordered to provide a\nregular management policy for solid waste as proposed by MINAM.\n•\nThe focus is on the District of Santa Rosa because this high Andean area lacks resources\nand mitigation protocols for waste generated by urban and agricultural activities, since\nthere is only street sweeping around parks and the market. In addition, collection is\nperformed by trucks only in the district capital, leaving 42 communities without this\nservice. Finally, the waste is disposed of in a dump without treatment.\n•\nAccording to the results obtained in the municipal solid waste characterization study\nand the organic solid waste recovery pilot plan in the District of Santa Rosa, the\ndevelopment of a solid organic waste recovery plan to produce compost is proposed,\nin order to reduce the deposit of reusable waste in the municipal dump.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nThe methodology is based on the methodological guide for the development of a\nmunicipal solid waste characterization study, where it details the equipment, ﬁeld materials,\nadequate inputs, and physical spaces needed for the collection, weighing and classiﬁcation\nof samples. Solid waste will be segregated and sampled to evaluate per capita generation,\ndensity and physical composition according to its nature and source (residential, non-\nresidential and special properties) with the corresponding labeling and registration for ﬁnal\ndisposal in sanitary landﬁlls and/or the recovery of solid waste [33].\nConsidering the solid waste item and its impact on urban society, adequate manage-\nment linked to protocols for the particular District of Santa Rosa are needed. Therefore, a\n\nAppl. Sci. 2023,13, 1646 3 of 18\nsolid waste characterization study (ECRS) is proposed with a subsequent recovery strategy,\nwhich is structured in Figure 1[34,35].\nSolid waste\nmanagement\nCharacterization\nof solid waste\nValorization of\nsolid waste\nField work\nand\noperations\nInformation\nanalysis\nPlanning\nSelective\ncollection\nTransportation\nof organic solid\nwaste\nTreatment\nof organic\nsolid waste\nProduction of\norganic\nfertilizer\n(compost)\nSource\nsegregation\nFigure 1.\nSolid waste management and its corresponding sub-stages: Characterization\nand valorization.\n2.1. Solid Waste Characterization\nThe intervention of district municipalities added to the implementation of manage-\nment instruments allow obtaining data on solid waste from homes. For this, a sequence of\nsteps based on the Kunitoshi Sakurai methodology was designed, where three levels were\noutlined (see Figure 2) [34,36].\n123\nFigure 2.\nStages in the characterization of solid waste: 1: planning; 2: ﬁeldwork and operations and\n3: information analysis.\n1.\nPlanning. Initially, the mayoral resolution (or municipal management resolution\nprepared by the head of the ﬁeld team) is prepared that allows maintaining the\nstructure of the work plan together with its projections for the properties, samples,\nidentiﬁcation of these and their subsequent analysis at the end of the collection.\nAccording to the ECRS Guide, to determine the number of samples for the study,\nofﬁcial data from INEI 2017 [\n37\n] is taken into account, which indicates that the district\n\nAppl. Sci. 2023,13, 1646 4 of 18\nhas 3210 homes. According to the range of household samples established by the\nguide for the characterization of municipal solid waste, a sample size of 94 homes\nis considered, to which must be added 19 contingency samples, making a total of\n113 household samples (see Table 1).\nTable 1.\nDetermination of the sample size for the characterization study. CS: contingency sample and\nHS: home samples.\nHousing Range Sample CS HS\nUp to 500 homes 45 9 54\nMore than 500 and up to 1000 homes 71 14 85\nMore than 1000 and up to 5000 homes 94 19 113\nMore than 5000 and up to 10,000 homes 95 19 114\nMore than 10,000 homes 96 19 115\nTo determine the distribution of the samples, the guide recommends dividing the\nstudy area into 2 strata (A and B) according to the number of homes in the district,\nwith stratum A being considered as an area with a greater number of homes and few\nbusinesses, and stratum B as an area with fewer homes and more shops (see Figure 3).\nIn the same way, the determination of non-domestic generators was made, among\nthem: wineries (35), restaurants (10), hostels and lodgings (4), Internet booths (2) and\nbakery (1) [38].\nV\nE\nE\nFigure 3. Sample distribution map for the study of municipal solid waste in the District of Santa Rosa.\nThe sequence of steps for the planning stage is divided into four groups. The ﬁrst\ngroup authorized by the competent municipal authority is in charge of designing,\napproving and managing the work plan with the corresponding supervision of the\ndocumentation of logistics, administration and planning, considering precautions\ntowards the environment. On the other hand, the sample handling procedures fall\nexclusively on a second team or group of helpers, associated workers and other\nvolunteers, led by a specialist with experience in ECRS, who will be in charge of\ncollecting solid waste in the area of study. Consequently, the analyses of the samples\ncollected by a third group are carried out under logistical approaches that involve\ntransport, destination areas (main and/or auxiliary), presence of managers, operators,\npromoters and managers of the devices or equipment to be used during the study in\nsuch a way that the objective is maintained efﬁciently and accurately.\n\nAppl. Sci. 2023,13, 1646 5 of 18\n2.\nFieldwork and operations. The solid waste sampling process stands out for the regis-\ntration of residential and non-residential properties using spreadsheets for handling,\nassigning and analyzing samples, as well as for each agent that generates solid waste.\nWithin this methodology, speciﬁc data are detailed, such as volume (using shaking\ntechniques to avoid bias), homogeneous segregation and additional criteria that allow\nquantifying and ordering each of the values obtained. The manager responsible for\nthe study was in charge of providing the training and assignment of functions as well\nas training on the use and management of safety implements and proper handling\nof solid waste for the entire work team. The team of the present study delivered\nletters of information and orientation to the owners of the homes, commercial es-\ntablishments and market administrator and coordinated with the street sweeping\npersonnel. Registers were ﬁlled with the data of sources that generate waste and\nclassiﬁcation of the participants by assigning codes. A physical space authorized by\nthe municipality was enabled to carry out the collection, weighing and classiﬁcation\nof the samples.Likewise, a vehicular unit was designated especially for the collec-\ntion of the samples at an established time and the transfer with the corresponding\nprecautions to be deposited in the assigned physical space, where they go through\nstages such as weighing each of the samples and writing them down on a ﬁle for\nsubsequent data analysis. Subsequently, the content is emptied to separate the com-\nponents, classify the materials by type, and determine the physical composition of\nthe waste. For determination of the density, a metallic cylinder of deﬁned volume\n(200 L) was conditioned, and the sample was placed in the cylinder where the density\ncalculation was completed using formulas where the average density of solid waste\nwas obtained [39]. This procedure was carried out for 8 days for all samples.\n3.\nInformation analysis. In the estimation of waste generated per capita (GPC), cal-\nculation tools were available for each mathematical analysis involved in obtaining\nvalues according to the data and days evaluated [\n39\n,\n40\n]. For an efﬁcient analysis, it\nis necessary to work with certain considerations, such as delimiting all the data in\nthe housing number, assigned codes, number of inhabitants and GPC data, among\nothers. The records with null values were not written as zeros but as empty cells,\nand thus avoiding calculations that alter the average. To determine the household\ngeneration per capita , it was necessary to know the number of inhabitants for each\ndwelling (289 inhabitants). Coded samples were collected for 8 consecutive days,\nand bag weights were noted. Performing the calculations using the formula estab-\nlished in RM 457-2018 Municipal Waste Characterization Guide [\n41\n], a household\nGPC of 0.77 kg/day was completed, and a non-household GPC of 4.37 kg/day was\ndetermined. The total generation of municipal solid waste was 3132.71 kg/day made\nup of domestic waste (2420.98 kg/day) and non-domestic waste (711.73 kg/day).\nLikewise, during the analysis of the physical composition of the solid waste of the\ndistrict, it was determined that reusable waste predominated with 69.87% to 30.13%\nfor non-usable waste of the total waste collected during the study, 222.49 kg/m\n3\n. For\nthe determination of the density of residential solid waste, 7 days were considered,\nexcluding day zero because it was considered unreliable data according to the guide,\nobtaining the result of 222.49 kg/m\n3\n, and the density for non-residential solid waste\nwas 202 kg/day [42].\n2.2. Solid Waste Valorization\nArticle N\nº\n. 37 of Legislative Decree 1278 details the comprehensive solid waste manage-\nment law, where SW management is proposed as a complement to the ﬁnal characterization\nfor reuse or recycling purposes, among other possible mitigation alternatives [24,43]. Giv-\ning SW components an objective for various mitigation processes, physical or energetic, is\na ﬁeld that involves the valorization process (see Figure 4) [\n44\n]. Chemical, physical and\nother related processes can be used in the recycling of residual matter, such as oil recovery,\nbioconversion and composting [\n45\n], obtaining various materials or substances, as well\n\nAppl. Sci. 2023,13, 1646 6 of 18\nas validated products within material recovery. On the other hand, the use implies pro-\ncesses of co-incineration, biodegradation for energy purposes, co-processing or obtaining\nenergy comparable to materials that conventionally generate energy, such as gas, oil and\nhydroelectricity [46].\n1.\nSource segregation. Prior to the valuation study, it was decided to work mainly with\n2 organic\nSW generators: the market (30 participants) and the green areas (2 parks\nand 2 gardens). Additionally, there was a sporadic generator of a fair during a week\nin the month of August. It should be noted that these segregation establishments were\npreviously registered, trained and sensitized for correct segregation and adequate\nstorage of SW.\n2.\nSelective collection. Organic SW from the market was collected on Monday, Tuesday,\nWednesday, Thursday and Friday. Sundays were included only for the last two months\n(October and November). Containers were placed at strategic points in the market for\nparticipants to deposit their waste in a coded bag; the personnel responsible for the\ncollection weighed the samples and made the corresponding annotation in the daily\nrecords. The collection of solid organic waste from the maintenance and cleaning of\nthe green areas of the district was on a monthly basis.\n3.\nTransport of organic solid waste. It was carried out by the trained personnel of the\nmunicipality in a truck with the enabled containers, from the district to the recovery\nplant located in the Simariva Population Center, Ayapampana sector, about 3.80 km.\nfrom the city.\n4.\nTreatment of organic solid waste. Once the organic solid waste arrived at the district\nrecovery plant (total area of the plant: 12\n×\n9 m, concrete ﬂoor, leachate channel\nand tin roof), trained personnel from the municipality proceeded to remove the\nnon-biodegradable materials (plastic, glass, metal). Then, this organic material was\narranged in static piles of 3 m ×2 m with a height of 1.2 m.\n5.\nProduction of organic fertilizer (compost). Organic solid waste was subjected to\naerobic composting techniques and covered with plastic for 10 days. Subsequently,\nthe batteries were removed when there was a sudden change in temperature or\nhumidity. Once the waste had a dark color, it was dried and sieved with a 1 cm cubic\nsieve to pack it in bags of organic fertilizer, destined for the different green areas, as\nwell as for the production of seedlings for forestry projects.\n2.3. Methodology\n2.3.1. Analysis of Variance\nThe analysis of variance (ANOVA) allows making a global comparison between\nsamples, minimizing the probability of sampling error, since, as the number of samples\nincreases, the total number of comparisons between pairs increases exponentially. That\nsaid, we can describe the effects model as follows:\nyij \\=µ+αi+εi j,∀j\\=1, · · · ,niand i \\=1, 2, · · · ,k(1)\nwhere\nyij\nis the jth observation of level i of factor A;,\nµ\nis the global average of the data,\nαi\nis\neffect of factor level i, and εij is the random component of the error.\nANOVA can be understood as a method to perform equality tests between three or\nmore population means based on the analysis of sample variance. In this article, ANOVA\nwas used to test whether the population means between the variables collected in the ﬁeld\nresearch are the same or different—being, as noted, the analysis performed through the\nvariances of the sample data collected.\n\nAppl. Sci. 2023,13, 1646 7 of 18\norganic\norganic\norganic\norganic\n123\n4\n5\nFigure 4.\nStages in the valorization of solid waste: 1: source segregation; 2: selective collection; 3:\ntransport of organic solid waste; 4: treatment of organic solid waste and 5: production of organic\nfertilizer (compost).\nIf the differences between the means are signiﬁcant, the Tukey test is used. The Tukey\ntest is based on the total studentized amplitude and can be used to compare any contrast\nbetween two treatment means; that is, it does not allow comparing groups with each other.\nThis procedure calculates the minimum signiﬁcant differences. With the Tukey test, it is\nexpected to ﬁnd which groups have growth rates with statistically equal means.\nTukey’s test can be used to test any difference between two sample means, being\ndeﬁned from the least signiﬁcant difference (MSD). The test can be deﬁned as\nMSD \\=qα(g,N−g)rMSE\nn(2)\nwhere\nn\nis the number of observations in the sample,\nqα\nis a value in Tukey test table with\nk\nlevels, and MSE is the mean squared error.\n2.3.2. Correlation Analysis\nTo perform the degree of dispersion more accurately, we used Pearson’s correlation\ncoefﬁcient (\nρ\n). This coefﬁcient measures the degree of correlation between two variables\n(negative or positive correlation). If\nρ\\=\n1, we say that there is a perfect positive corre-\nlation between the variables; if\nρ\\=−\n1, there is a perfect negative correlation between\nthe variables; if\nρ\\=\n0, the variables are linearly independent. We can write Pearson’s\ncoefﬁcient as\nρ\\=∑n\ni\\=1(xi−¯\nx)(yi−¯\ny)\nq∑n\ni\\=1(xi−¯\nx)2·q∑n\ni\\=1(yi−¯\ny)2\\=cov(X,Y)\npvar(X)·var(Y)(3)\nwhere\nxi\nand\nyi\nare two variables for\ni\\= (\n1,\n. . .\n,\nn)\n,\n¯\nx\nand\n¯\ny\nare means, and\nvar(x)\nand\nvar(y)are variances.\nAppl. Sci. 2023,13, 1646 8 of 18\n2.3.3. Clustering Analysis\nAs a clustering instrument, a principal component analysis (PCA) method was cho-\nsen. This method aims to analyze the covariance structure through a process of linear\ncombination of variables. The main component being deﬁned by\nYi\\=e0\niX\\=ei1X1+ei2X2+. . . +ei pXpfor i\\=1, . . . , p(4)\nwhere X0\\=X1,X2, . . . , Xpis a random vector.\n\nResults\n\nThis section presents the results found in the study. We show the analysis of variance,\ncorrelation matrix between observations and clustering analysis with principal component.\nThe methods are applied for three collected datasets: house solid waste, commercial solid\nwaste, and grocery solid waste observations.\n3.1. House Analysis\nThe ANOVA was applied to identify whether there is a signiﬁcant difference between\nthe means observed for the two groups analyzed (Group A and Group B) in relation to the\neight days of the week collected in the survey.\nThe results (Table 2) indicate that there is no signiﬁcant difference for the means of\nGroups A and B and for the days of the week. Thus, with a p-value of 0.5091, we do not\nreject the null hypothesis of equality between the means, and with a p-value of 0.2864, we\ndo not reject the null hypothesis of equality between the means.\nTable 2. Anova results for house solid waste.\nDf Sum Sq Mean Sq F Value Pr (>F)\nDays 7 3.90 0.56 0.90 0.5091\nGroups 1 0.71 0.71 1.14 0.2864\nResiduals 567 352.72 0.62\nCorrelation analysis is effective for identifying similar behaviors among a set of\nobservations for variables. Figure 5shows that there is a high correlation between the\nvolume of waste observed in homes during the days of the survey, considering the two\ngroups analyzed. The result observed between days (high correlation coefﬁcients) shows\nthat the two observed groups haven very similar behavior.\nFigure 6presents an analysis based on principal components. It is possible to observe\nwhich are the most important variables to observe the variation of the data and identify how\nthe data are grouped. It is observed that as the data are highly correlated, there is no well-\ndeﬁned pattern, rather an overlap of results that follow similar paths. The ﬁrst principal\ncomponent contains 41.76% of the variance, and the second principal component contains\n17.70% of the variance. Together, the two components contain 59.46% of the information.\nThe analysis also considered the composition of the residues in organic and inorganic\nmatter (Figure 7). It is observed that there is a higher concentration of organic waste, with\na higher incidence on Day 1. Another fact is the stable values on inorganic solid waste.\n\nAppl.

Commercial Analysis\nThe ANOVA was applied to identify whether there is a signiﬁcant difference between\nthe means observed for the ﬁve groups analyzed (store, coffee shop, bakery, hotel, and\nrestaurant) in relation to the eight days of the week collected in the survey.\nThe results (Table 3) indicate that there is signiﬁcant difference for the means of groups\nand no signiﬁcance for the days of the week. Thus, with a p-value of 0.3296, we do not\nreject the null hypothesis of equality between the means, and with a p-value of 0.000, we\nreject the null hypothesis of equality between the means for groups.\nTable 3.

Observing the pairs, we can see that there is a signiﬁcant difference between the\nbakery and the hotel (Figure 8). The other groups do not show a signiﬁcant difference.\nFigure 9shows that there is a high correlation between the volume of waste observed in\ncommercial buildings during the days of the survey, considering the two groups analyzed.\nThe result observed between Days 7 and 3 (0.87), between Days 7 and 1 (0.84) and between\nDays 7 and 8 (0.85) can be highlighted. These results show that the consumption of waste\nobserved in the groups has a similar behavior.\nTable 4.

It is observed that there is a\ndifference between the behavior of the restaurant in relation to other commercial establish-\nments. The other establishments are grouped in terms of volume of waste generated, while\nrestaurants have a greater participation in Component 1. In this case, we use ﬁve principal\ncomponents. The ﬁrst principal component contains 79.56% of the variance, and the second\nprincipal component contains 5.26% of the variance. Together, the two components contain\n84.82% of the information.\n\nAppl.

Grocery Analysis\nThe ANOVA was applied to identify whether there is a signiﬁcant difference between\nthe means observed for the two groups analyzed (from June to November) in relation to\nthe twenty days of the month collected in the survey.\nThe results (Table 5) indicate that there is signiﬁcant difference for the means of months\nand for the days of the month. Thus, with a p-value of 0.0000, we reject the null hypothesis\nof equality between the means of months, and with a p-value of 0.0000, we reject the null\nhypothesis of equality between the means of days of months.\nTable 5.

As we see in the other\nanalysis, it is possible to observe which are the most important variables to observe the\nvariation of the data and identify how the data are grouped. It is observed that there are\nthree main groups: District 1 (June and July), District 2 (September, October and November)\nand District 3 (August). In this case, we use six principal components. The ﬁrst principal\ncomponent contains 46.63% of the variance, and the second principal component contains\n11.10% of the variance.

Principal components analysis (clustering-grocery).\nAppl. Sci. 2023,13, 1646 14 of 18\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe problem of solid waste disposal in the Santa Rosa District, Ayacucho, is linked to\npoor access to public services, which makes the residentrs dispose of their municipal solid\nwaste in dumps, constituting a serious environmental and sanitary problem. This is the\nsame scenario as another district, Ayacucho (Sacsamarca), that also makes use of dumps\nwith a few years of useful life, whose solution projected by the municipality only focuses\non building larger dumps [\n32\n] and not on carrying out studies of characterization and\nrecovery of solid waste that are of vital importance within the process of urban planning\nand territorial ordering [\n47\n]. A similar case, in another country, occurs in Keta, Africa,\nwhere they lack solid waste management due to having little availability of economic\nresources [48].\nThe GPC of residential solid waste in Santa Rosa (0.77 kg/day) was higher than that\nfound in Dilla Town, Ethiopia (0.47 kg/day) [\n49\n] and lower than the GPC of non-residential\nsolid waste of Santa Rosa (4.37 kg/day) for having fewer commercial establishments such\nas warehouses, restaurants, hotels, bakeries and cafeterias. Likewise, the averages obtained\nfrom GPC of household solid waste for the strata of the present study (0.44 stratum A\nand 1.03 stratum B), are similar to the results of the studies carried out in the city of Laga\nDadi, Ethiopia, with an average GPC of 0.45 for household solid waste [\n50\n]. On the other\nhand, the GPC values for non-residential solid waste from hotels and other commercial\nestablishments for Santa Rosa were 4.17 and 6.0, respectively, and for Laga Dadi, 1.81 and\n1.57, respectively, [\n50\n]. In another investigation, developed in Germany, it was found that\nhotels generate around 58% of organic solid waste and that a minimum of 36% of recyclable\nwaste could be recovered [51,52].\nThe solid waste generated is predominantly made up of more usable waste (69.87%)\nthan non-usable waste (30.13%) and within the usable waste, a greater amount of or-\nganic than inorganic solid waste was obtained, similar to what was found in Dilla Town,\nEthiopia and in Costa Rica, whose percentage of organic solid waste was 68.40 and 55.9%,\nrespectively [47,49]\n. However, regarding inorganic solid waste, the percentage of paper\nand plastics was very different; while in the District of Santa Rosa, 14.43% of plastic was\ngenerated, in Dilla Town and Costa Rica 1.90 and 10.2% of plastics were generated, respec-\ntively [\n49\n]. The high percentage of plastics in Santa Rosa corresponds to the increase in\nurbanization and its consequent increase in inorganic solid waste [\n53\n–\n55\n]. When comparing\nthe results obtained for the commercial and household sectors, it is evident that organic\nmatter waste acquires a greater preponderance than materials with recycling potential [\n47\n].\nIt should be noted that one of the main causes of the generation of waste for Santa\nRosa is consumption by the population during festive dates [\n56\n]. In this sense, in the\nmonth of August, the patron festival alluding to the patron saint Santa Rosa de Lima [\n57\n] is\ncommemorated. Likewise, in the month of November, the main date is the political creation\nof the District of Santa Rosa [\n58\n], as well as the consecration towards the regeneration of\nlife and fertility, a festivity that welcomes the rains of the humid seasons [\n57\n]. This set\nof dates and other possible alternate festivities may be the cause of the increase in solid\nwaste in the months of August and November (see Figure 14) compared to June to July,\nwith much less SW produced. By reducing the amount of organic waste generated, the\nDistrict of Santa Rosa could obtain economic beneﬁts by reducing the costs of collection,\ntransportation and disposal of\nwaste [59]\nand through recovery increase the options for\nsolid waste management when the establishment of sanitary landﬁlls is not viable [60].\n\nAppl.

Valorized organic waste.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe proposed methodology was organized in its own sequences that allowed a quantification,\nsegregation and subsequent valuation within the District of Santa Rosa. However, it was concluded\nin the characterization study that the physical composition of solid waste is predominantly made\nup of reusable waste with 69.87% usable and 30.13% non-usable. In addition, a total of 2420.98\nkg/day of household solid waste was collected, whose GPC was 0.77 kg/day and density was\n222.49 kg/m\n3\n. Likewise, a total of 711.73 kg/day of non-residential solid waste was collected, with\na GPC of 4.37 kg/day and a density of 202 kg/m\n3\n. In addition, according to the characterization\ncarried out by Strata A and B, no significant differences were found between the amount of solid\nwaste collected (p-value \\= 0.2864) despite the fact that in Stratum B, there were a greater number\nof commercial establishments. Within the latter, significant differences were observed between the\nsolid waste generated in restaurants and other non-residential solid waste generators. On the other\nhand, it was determined that organic waste is generated in greater quantity than inorganic waste.\nWith the characterization of solid waste, it was possible to show that the collected\nsample is predominantly composed of organic solid waste, so it was necessary to carry out\na recovery plan for this type of waste. This plan implied the participation of two generating\nsources: the market and parks–gardens, collecting organic solid waste between the months\nof June and November, within which, in the month of August, the largest amount of organic\nsolid waste was collected due to the many festivals being celebrated. It was shown that\nthe markets produce more organic RSS, and therefore, by valuing what was collected, a\ngreater amount of fertilizer was produced, unlike the green areas that produce few RSS\nand less frequently, so the markets would be the best source of generation of organic RSS\nfor valorization studies. Finally, as a result of the recovery, a total of 4.12 tons of compost\nwas obtained through composting.\nAt the end of the characterization and recovery procedure, it was possible to determine\nthat the largest amount of solid waste arriving at the dump was organic solid waste and that\nits recovery managed to minimize the amount of organic solid waste entering the dump. It\nshould be noted that previous characterization studies have been carried out in the District\nof Santa Rosa, this being the ﬁrst time that a pilot plan for the recovery of organic waste\nwas carried out for six months, with which it was possible to obtain compost as a product\nﬁnal. This compost was allocated to different green areas of the city, to the production of\nforest seedlings for the different district projects and as an incentive in ecological contests.\nIn this context, it is concluded that it is feasible to carry out an organic solid waste recovery\nplan for the District of Santa Rosa in order to obtain more than four tons of natural compost\nwithin a period of six months.\nAppl.

Padilla-Vento\n\nJuan J. Soria\n\nThis study addresses the evaluation of the generation of domestic solid waste in Peruvian households using statistical techniques and the SEMMA and PCA data mining methodology. The objective is to explore how waste management, population and the Per Capita Generation index PCG index per capita influence the production of this waste in Peruvian departments. The sample was obtained from the database of annual reports submitted by district and provincial municipalities to MINAM through the Information System for Solid Waste Management (SIGERSOL), including data from the 24 departments of Peru, with a total of 14,852 records organized in 196 registration forms. Statistical techniques and the adaptation of the SEMMA methodology were applied together with the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to examine the impacts of the accumulation of household solid waste in Peru. This study showed that the first component accounts for 80.2% of the inertia. Combining the first two components accounts for 99.8% of the total variation, suggesting that most of the meaningful information can be maintained using only two dimensions. Welch’s ANOVA showed significant differences in domestic solid waste generation among Peruvian departments [ F (6, 94.310) = 790.444; p = 0.0, p < 0.05]. In addition, a square Eta of 99.09% revealed a very large effect size, indicating that the amount of population explains 99.09% of the variation in the generation of this waste between the departments. The PCG index had a moderate effect, suggesting the need for further studies to explore the underlying causes of regional differences and assess the effectiveness of the waste management measures implemented. A positive relationship was found between the production of Domestic Solid Waste (DSW) and the number of inhabitants. Lima stood out with the highest average of DSW 13220.47 tons and the PCG index of 50%. Using Ward’s method, three groups were obtained and PCA was applied to each group. In the Group, Lambayeque 5616.48 tons, Loreto 2946.44 tons and San Martín 1596.07 tons registered the highest DSW averages, while Amazonas 441.1 tons obtained the lowest. Ucayali 60%, Loreto 58% and San Martín 57% showed the highest PCG indexes. In Group b, Ayacucho 701.81 tons had the highest average DSW and Apurimac 497 tons the lowest. Tacna and Apurimac with 44% and Moquegua 43% registered the highest PCG indexes, while Huancavelica 42% and Pasco 41% had the lowest. In Group C Piura 4476.53 tons and La Libertad 3478.46 tons showed the highest DSW averages, while Huánuco 859.41 tons and Cajamarca 812.74 tons registered the lowest. Ica and Piura led with an average PCG of 48%, while Puno and Junín with 43% had the lowest values.\nView\nShow abstract\n...

According to the source, solid waste can be roughly divided into three kinds: domestic waste, general industrial solid waste and hazardous waste. Domestic waste refers to the waste generated in People's Daily life, including food residues, paper scraps, gray soil, packaging, waste products, etc. (Quispe et al., 2023). General industrial solid waste includes fly ash, smelting waste slag, furnace slag, tailings, industrial water treatment sludge, coal gangue and industrial dust. ...\nOptimizing environmental costs and economic benefits in new energy vehicle production: A case study of FAW Hongqi in China\nArticle\nFull-text available\n\n\nJul 2024\n\n\nGuangzhi Wang\n\nYixi Wang\nMingze Li\n\nThis study focuses on the environmental cost accounting and economic benefit optimization of China’s FAW Hongqi New Energy Vehicle manufacturing enterprise under uncertain conditions, within the context of the emission permit system This study calculates the pollution situation throughout the manufacturing and production process of FAW Hongqi new energy vehicles, and constructs a multi-level environmental cost evaluation system for FAW Hongqi new energy vehicle manufacturing projects. Through the interval fuzzy model of FAW Hongqi new energy vehicle manufacturing projects, the maximum economic benefits of the enterprise are simulated. The research results indicate that the pollution emissions of enterprises are mainly concentrated in the three processes of welding, painting, and final assembly. Enterprises use their own exhaust gas and wastewater treatment devices to meet the standards for pollution emissions. At the same time, solid waste generated during the automobile manufacturing process is handed over to third-party companies for treatment. Secondly, based on the accounting results of enterprise pollution source intensity and a multi-layer environmental cost evaluation system, the environmental costs of enterprises are accounted for, and the environmental costs are represented in interval form to reduce uncertainty in the accounting process. According to the accounting results of enterprise environmental costs, the main environmental costs of enterprises are environmental remediation costs caused by normal pollution discharge and purchase costs of environmental protection facilities. Pollutant emission taxes and routine environmental monitoring costs are relatively low. Enterprises can adopt more scientific solutions from the aspects of environmental remediation and environmental protection facilities to reduce environmental costs. After optimization by the fuzzy interval uncertainty optimization model, the economic benefits of the FAW Hongqi new energy vehicle manufacturing project were [101,254.71, 6278.5413] million yuan. Compared with the interval uncertainty optimization model, the lower bound of economic benefits increased by 57.68%, and the upper bound decreased by 12.08%, shortening the results of the economic benefits interval. Clarify the current environmental pollution situation of FAW Hongqi’s new energy vehicle manufacturing enterprise, provide data support for sustainable development of the enterprise, and provide reasonable decision-making space for enterprise decision-makers.\nView\nShow abstract\n... This not only reduces disposal costs but also promotes the reuse of construction materials, a key aspect of the circular economy.

Finally, we believe that this filtering-combination forecasting method can obtain highly efficient and accurate forecasts for other complex financial time-series data such as inflation, unemployment and cryptocurrencies. Likewise, in other scenarios and with different data, for example, energy [53,54], air pollution [55][56][57][58][59], solid waste [60], academic performance [61] and digital marketing [62]. ...\nForecasting stock prices using a novel filtering-combination technique: Application to the Pakistan stock exchange\nArticle\nFull-text available\n\n\nJan 2024\n\n\nHasnain Iftikhar\n\nMurad Khan\nJosue Turpo\nJavier Linkolk López-Gonzales\n\nTraders and investors find predicting stock market values an intriguing subject to study in stock exchange markets. Accurate projections lead to high financial revenues and protect investors from market risks. This research proposes a unique filtering-combination approach to increase forecast accuracy. The first step is to filter the original series of stock market prices into two new series, consisting of a nonlinear trend series in the long run and a stochastic component of a series, using the Hodrick-Prescott filter. Next, all possible filtered combination models are considered to get the forecasts of each filtered series with linear and nonlinear time series forecasting models. Then, the forecast results of each filtered series are combined to extract the final forecasts. The proposed filtering-combination technique is applied to Pakistan's daily stock market price index data from January 2, 2013 to February 17, 2023. To assess the proposed forecasting methodology's performance in terms of model consistency, efficiency and accuracy, we analyze models in different data set ratios and calculate four mean errors, correlation coefficients and directional mean accuracy. Last, the authors recommend testing the proposed filtering-combination approach for additional complicated financial time series data in the future to achieve highly accurate, efficient and consistent forecasts.\nView\nShow abstract\n... First, the technique is developed to analyze environmental pollution data based on univariate time series from various sources. Further studies are required for its validation in other contexts (for example, in data related to air quality [59][60][61], solid waste [62], also in academic performance data [63], data related to digital marketing [64] or those based on energy efficiency [65,66]). One of the methodology's significant limitations is that it does not preserve the time series structure since it assumes an auto-regressive model with a predefined lag size. ...\nSelf-Organizing Topological Multilayer Perceptron: A Hybrid Method to Improve the Forecasting of Extreme Pollution Values\nArticle\nFull-text available\n\n\nNov 2023\n\n\nJavier Linkolk López-Gonzales\n\nAna María Gómez\nRomina Torres\nRodrigo Salas\n\nForecasting air pollutant levels is essential in regulatory plans focused on controlling and mitigating air pollutants, such as particulate matter. Focusing the forecast on air pollution peaks is challenging and complex since the pollutant time series behavior is not regular and is affected by several environmental and urban factors. In this study, we propose a new hybrid method based on artificial neural networks to forecast daily extreme events of PM2.5 pollution concentration. The hybrid method combines self-organizing maps to identify temporal patterns of excessive daily pollution found at different monitoring stations, with a set of multilayer perceptron to forecast extreme values of PM2.5 for each cluster. The proposed model was applied to analyze five-year pollution data obtained from nine weather stations in the metropolitan area of Santiago, Chile. Simulation results show that the hybrid method improves performance metrics when forecasting daily extreme values of PM2.5.\nView\nShow abstract\n...

Its negative impacts go far beyond ecosystems and the economy, harming human health and environmental sustainability. Given these facts, efficient and accurate modeling and forecasting for the concentration of ozone are vital. Thus, this study explores an in-depth analysis of forecasting the concentration of ozone by comparing many hybrid combinations of time series models. To this end, in the first phase, the hourly ozone time series is decomposed into three new sub-series, including the long-term trend, the seasonal trend, and the stochastic series, by applying the seasonal trend decomposition method. In the second phase, we forecast every sub-series with three popular time series models and all their combinations In the final phase, the results of each sub-series forecast are combined to achieve the results of the final forecast. The proposed hybrid time series forecasting models were applied to four Metropolitan Lima monitoring stations-ATE, Campo de Marte, San Borja, and Santa Anita-for the years 2017, 2018, and 2019 in the winter season. Thus, the combinations of the considered time series models generated 27 combinations for each sampling station. They demonstrated significant forecasts of the sample based on highly accurate and efficient descriptive, statistical, and graphic analysis tests, as a lower mean error occurred in the optimized forecast models compared to baseline models. The most effective hybrid models for the ATE, Campo de Marte, San Borja, and Santa Anita stations were identified based on their superior out-of-sample forecast results, as measured by RMSE (4.611, 3.637, 1.495, and 1.969), RMSPE (4.464, 11.846, 1.864, and 15.924), MAE (1.711, 2.356, 1.078, and 1.462), and MAPE (14.862, 20.441, 7.668, and 76.261) errors. These models significantly outperformed other models due to their lower error values. In addition, the best models are statistically significant (p < 0.05) and superior to the rest of the combination models. Furthermore, the final proposed models show significant performance with the least mean error, which is comparatively better than the considered baseline models. Finally, the authors also recommend using the proposed hybrid time series combination forecasting models to predict ozone concentrations in other districts of Lima and other parts of Peru.\nView\nShow abstract\n... Furthermore, since only linear and non-linear univariate and multivariate time series models were used in this work, machine learning models such as deep learning and artificial neural networks can also be considered within the current decomposition combination forecasting framework. It can also be extended and applied to other approaches and datasets (for example, energy [53][54][55], air pollution [56][57][58][59], solid waste [60] and academic performance [61]). ...\nDay-Ahead Electricity Demand Forecasting Using a Novel Decomposition Combination Method\nArticle\nFull-text available\n\n\nNov 2023\n\n\nHasnain Iftikhar\n\nJosue Turpo\nPaulo Canas Rodrigues\nJavier Linkolk López-Gonzales\n\nIn the present liberalized energy markets, electricity demand forecasting is critical for planning of generation capacity and required resources. An accurate and efficient electricity demand forecast can reduce the risk of power outages and excessive power generation. Avoiding blackouts is crucial for economic growth, and electricity is an essential energy source for industry. Considering these facts, this study presents a detailed analysis of the forecast of hourly electricity demand by comparing novel decomposition methods with several univariate and multivariate time series models. To that end, we use the three proposed decomposition methods to divide the electricity demand time series into the following subseries: a long-run linear trend, a seasonal trend, and a stochastic trend. Next, each subseries is forecast using all conceivable combinations of univariate and multivariate time series models. Finally, the multiple forecasting models are immediately integrated to provide a final one-day-ahead electricity demand forecast. The presented modeling and forecasting technique is implemented for the Nord Pool electricity market’s hourly electricity demand. Three accuracy indicators, a statistical test, and a graphical analysis are used to assess the performance of the proposed decomposition combination forecasting technique. Hence, the forecasting results demonstrate the efficiency and precision of the proposed decomposition combination forecasting technique. In addition, the final best combination model within the proposed forecasting framework is comparatively better than the best models proposed in the literature and standard benchmark models. Finally, we suggest that the decomposition combination forecasting approach developed in this study be employed to handle additional complicated power market forecasting challenges.\nView\nShow abstract\n... Machine learning models such as deep learning and artificial neural networks can also be considered part of the current forecasting decompositioncombination technique. It can also be extended and applied to other approaches and datasets (for example, energy [1,3], air pollution [67][68][69][70], solid waste [71] and academic performance [72]). ...\nForecasting Day-Ahead Electricity Prices for the Italian Electricity Market Using a New Decomposition-Combination Technique\nArticle\nFull-text available\n\n\nSep 2023\n\n\nHasnain Iftikhar\n\nJosue Turpo\nPaulo Canas Rodrigues\nJavier Linkolk López-Gonzales\n\nOver the last 30 years, day-ahead electricity price forecasts have been critical to public and private decision-making. This importance has increased since the global wave of deregulation and liberalization in the energy sector at the end of the 1990s. Given these facts, this work presents a new decomposition-combination technique that employs several nonparametric regression methods and various time-series models to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of day-ahead electricity price forecasting. For this purpose, first, the time-series of the original electricity prices deals with the treatment of extreme values. Second, the filtered series of the electricity prices is decomposed into three new subseries, namely the long-term trend, a seasonal series, and a residual series, using two new proposed decomposition methods. Third, we forecast each subseries using different univariate and multivariate time-series models and all possible combinations. Finally, the individual forecasting models are combined directly to obtain the final one-day-ahead price forecast. The proposed decomposition-combination forecasting technique is applied to hourly spot electricity prices from the Italian electricity-market data from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2019. Hence, four different accuracy mean errors-mean absolute error, mean squared absolute percent error, root mean squared error, and mean absolute percent error; a statistical test, the Diebold-Marino test; and graphical analysis are determined to check the performance of the proposed decomposition-combination forecasting method. The experimental findings (mean errors, statistical test, and graphical analysis) show that the proposed forecasting method is effective and accurate in day-ahead electricity price forecasting. Additionally, our forecasting outcomes are comparable to those described in the literature and are regarded as standard benchmark models. Finally, the authors recommended that the proposed decomposition-combination forecasting technique in this research work be applied to other complicated energy market forecasting challenges.\nView\nShow abstract\n... Furthermore, the findings of this study indicate that the proposed combination model outperformed other methods in capturing the complex and nonlinear behavior of crude oil prices. This suggests that the hybrid forecasting approach holds promise for applications beyond crude oil prices (for example, energy [47,48], air pollution [49][50][51], solid waste [52], academic performance [53] and digital marketing [54]). Therefore, it is recommended to employ this methodology for forecasting other complex financial time series data, such as inflation, unemployment, and cryptocurrencies. ...\nForecasting Day-Ahead Brent Crude Oil Prices Using Hybrid Combinations of Time Series Models\nArticle\nFull-text available\n\n\nAug 2023\n\n\nHasnain Iftikhar\n\nAimel Zafar\nJosue Turpo\nJavier Linkolk López-Gonzales\n\nCrude oil price forecasting is an important research area in the international bulk commodity market. However, as risk factors diversify, price movements exhibit more complex nonlinear behavior. Hence, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of forecasting Brent crude oil prices by comparing various hybrid combinations of linear and nonlinear time series models. To this end, first, the logarithmic transformation is used to stabilize the variance of the crude oil prices time series; second, the original time series of log crude oil prices is decomposed into two new subseries, such as a long-run trend series and a stochastic series, using the Hodrick-Prescott filter; and third, two linear and two nonlinear time series models are considered to forecast the decomposed subseries. Finally, the forecast results for each subseries are combined to obtain the final day-ahead forecast result. The proposed modeling framework is applied to daily Brent spot prices from 1 January 2013 to 27 December 2022. Six different accuracy metrics, pictorial analysis, and a statistical test are performed to verify the proposed methodology's performance. The experimental results (accuracy measures, pictorial analysis, and statistical test) show the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed hybrid forecasting methodology. Additionally, our forecasting results are comparatively better than the benchmark models. Finally, we believe that the proposed forecasting method can be used for other complex financial time data to obtain highly efficient and accurate forecasts.\nView\nShow abstract\nShow more\nProposal for the Management of Solid Urban Waste Generated in Naranjillo, Capital of the District of Luyando, Perú\nArticle\nFull-text available\n\n\nApr 2022\n\n\nE. Daza\n\nA. Da Cruz\nSteve Dann Camargo Hinostroza\nNadia Balbin\n\nTo meet the objectives, the solid urban waste generated in Naranjillo is characterized and quantified and its adequate management is proposed. For this purpose, the methodology of the United Nations Urban Management Program, the calculation of the sanitary landfill through the guide for the design, construction, and operation of manual sanitary landfills, by Jorge Jaramillo, was used. The study determined 91.14% of usable solid waste and 8.86% of unusable solid waste whose final disposal should be in the sanitary landfill. 75.72% are organic waste that have the biological treatment in the composting plant; 15.42% of inorganic solid waste should be recycled through classification in the manual segregation plant, both components should enter the economic cycle. The volume of the landfill calculated until 2030 corresponds to 1555.80m ³ for a projected population of 4695 inhabitants in that year: with an urban solid waste production of 1575.86 Kg/day. The municipality of the district of Luyando by applying the proposed model of urban solid waste will improve the quality of life of its inhabitants by avoiding the contamination of water, soil, air, and the deterioration of the landscape.\nView\nShow abstract\nEnvironmental Management Virtual Methodology for Household Waste Characterization During The Pandemic in An Urban District of Peru: Citizen Science for Waste Management\nArticle\nFull-text available\n\nJun 2022\n\nENVIRON MANAGE\n\n\nNorvin Requena Sánchez\n\nDalia Carbonel\nStephan Moonsammy\nKelvin Tsun Wai Ng\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has caused the alteration of many aspects of the solid waste management chain, such as variations in the waste composition, generation and disposal. Various studies have examined these changes with analysis of integrated waste management strategies; qualitative studies on perceived variations and statistical evaluations based on waste collected or disposed in landfills. Despite this information there is a need for updated data on waste generation and composition, especially in developing countries. The objective of this article is to develop a data sampling and analytical approach for the collection of data on household waste generation and composition during the pandemic; and, in addition, estimate the daily generation of masks in the study area. The proposed methodology is based on the principles of citizen science and utilizes virtual tools to contact participants, and for the training and collection of information. The study participants collected the information, installed segregation bins in their homes and trained their relatives in waste segregation. The article presents the results of the application of the methodology in an urban district of Lima (Peru) in August 2020. The results suggest an apparent decrease in household waste per capita and a slight increase in plastics composition in the study area. It is estimated that each participant generates 0.124 masks per day and 0.085 pairs of gloves per day. The method developed and results presented can be used as a tool for public awareness and training on household waste characterization and segregation. Furthermore it can provide the necessary evidence to inform policy directives in response household waste issues and Covid-19 restrictions.\nView\nShow abstract\nTransformation of Solid Waste Management in China: Moving towards Sustainability through Digitalization-Based Circular Economy\nArticle\nFull-text available\n\n\nFeb 2022\n\n\nTonni Agustiono Kurniawan\n\nXue Liang\nElizabeth O’Callaghan\nTutuk Djoko Kusworo\n\nIn China, environmental pollution due to municipal solid waste (MSW) over-generation is one of the country’s priority concerns. The increasing volume and complexity of the waste poses serious risks to the environment and public health. Currently, the annual growth of MSW generation is estimated to be approximately 8–10% and will increase to 323 million metric tons (Mt) by 2030. Based on the secondary data collected from a literature survey, this article critically evaluates the recent progress of MSW management (MSWM) in China and offers new insights into the waste sector in the era of Industry 4.0. This helps decision makers in China to plan a smooth transition nationwide to a circular economy (CE) in the waste sector. It is evident that digitalization is a driving force for China to move towards low-carbon development strategies within the framework of CE. Through digitalization, the waste sector has promoted prevention, reduction, reuse, and recycling (3Rs) of waste before waste disposal in landfills. A proper implementation of digitalization-based waste recycling has contributed to an efficient cooperation between the government and private sector, increased job opportunities, and promoted the conservation of resources. It is anticipated that this work not only contributes to the establishment of an integrated MSWM system in China, but also improves local MSWM through digitalization in the framework of a CE.\nView\nShow abstract\nTechno-economic analysis of an enhanced anaerobic digester in the Andean area of Peru\nArticle\nFull-text available\n\n\nJan 2022\n\n\nAdriana Jaeger\n\nRichard Blanchard\n\nThis paper aims to determine the economic and technical feasibility of developing a thermally enhanced digester in the Andean area using solar collectors. Communities in the rural area of the Andes lack access to electricity and other basic services which impact negatively on their everyday life and exposes them to harmful and inefficient fuels. Several experiences with anaerobic digestion prove that this technology could be applied in the Andean area, although its performance is limited due to low temperatures. To overcome this constraint, an enhanced digester was modelled and simulated using TRNSYS Software. The system consisted of two solar collectors, a storage tank and a digester with a wrapped-around heat exchanger. The average digester temperature in the simulation was 30.7 °C. The enhanced temperature was used in a model to calculate the daily biogas production. The Net Present Value and Internal Rate of Return were calculated and confirm the economic viability of the project. The biogas production fully covers the requirements of the system for household cooking and lighting, making a significant social impact. This simulation indicates that it is technically possible to develop an enhanced digester in the Andean area that is economically viable as well.\nView\nShow abstract\nA novel methodology for household waste characterization during the COVID-19 pandemic: case study results\nArticle\nFull-text available\n\n\nOct 2021\n\n\nNorvin Requena Sánchez\n\nDalia Carbonel\nLuis F. Diaz Campodónico\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused a large number of the world’s cities to establish quarantines. Much has been said about the environmental impacts of the confinement; however, very little data have been collected related to household waste generation and composition. In this study, the authors propose a novel methodology for the characterization of household waste without having to leave home, by using virtual training and completing forms. The results of the evaluation carried out in late September 2020 in three districts in the Arequipa province, Peru (Districts A, B and C) are presented. A total of 246 people participated in a survey on waste generation and segregation habits, and 44 people participated in the waste characterization study. Taking into account the error of the study, it can only be stated with certainty that waste generation decreased only in District B. The percentage of organic waste declined in Districts A and B, and increased in District C. Composition of hazardous and sanitary wastes increased significantly in all three districts. Each household generated an average of two to four masks and one pair of gloves per week.\nView\nShow abstract\nContaminación por Residuos Sólidos Urbanos: Caso Comunidad de Occochaca, Huanta, Perú, 2021\nArticle\nFull-text available\n\n\nJul 2021\n\n\nCarlos Enrique Marchan-Solier\n\nValeria Alejandra Zorrilla-Crespo\nMariano Anthony Cardenas-Quispe\nAlex Pacheco\n\nLa contaminación por residuos sólidos urbanos es un problema que afecta a todas las ciudades sobre todo en las zonas rurales de la región de Ayacucho.

These inappropriate wastes cause deterioration of the environment and the ozone layer. This is why we are currently seeing an abrupt change in climate and diseases caused by environmental pollution. The objective of the research work is to perform a system dynamics modeling for effective and efficient solid waste management in Lima Peru, and thus contribute to the scientific community to achieve a future vision for solid waste management. The methodology used was system dynamics, which made it possible to analyze and understand the behavior of a complex solid waste system in a given time. In addition, vensim software was used for system dynamics modeling, creating the causal diagram and forrester diagram for solid waste management. The results obtained are the system dynamics modeling proposed for solid waste management, which were modeled from 2020 to 2030, where by 2030 it will be reduced in favorable equilibrium to 23,066 tons. Thanks to this system dynamics modeling, society will be made aware of the need to sort and use solid waste, in order to reduce environmental pollution. Likewise, having a healthy environment that will benefit health, agriculture and education will benefit society as a whole.\nView\nShow abstract\nCellulolytic and Amylolytic Bacteria with Potential for Composting Urban Solid Waste at Low Temperatures in Northern Peru\nArticle\n\n\nJan 2022\n\n\nCarlos Millones\n\nErnestina Rosario Vásquez\nSamia L.

As important participants, consumers' behaviors and attitudes will play a vital role in solving the problem. This study uses the conditional value method (CVM) to evaluate the differences in the attitudes and willingness to pay of urban and rural residents toward EPW in Guangdong Province, China. The results show that the respondents have limited knowledge of the recycling situation, relevant policies and environmental impacts of express delivery packaging, although more than 60% of respondents do think that there is a problem with excessive packaging. The low recycling rate for packaging materials is mainly attributed to the lack of recycling facilities and publicity on environmental issues. The differences between urban and rural residents are mainly over disposal methods, the views on excessive packaging and willingness to pay (WTP) for EPW. Finally, the WTP values of urban and rural residents choosing a “deposit” system are 1.58 (0.24)and1.79yuan(0.24) and 1.79 yuan (0.28) per piece, respectively, while the WTP values (for increased fees) are 0.64 yuan (0.10)and0.60yuan(0.10) and 0.60 yuan (0.09) per piece, respectively. The obtained results may serve as a reference for different regional responses to the promotion and improvement of EPW management in the future.\nView\nShow abstract\nShow more\nPowered By\n00:00/01:38\n10\n107.6M\n225\nTop three ways social proof can boost your organic reach and engagement\nShare\nNext\nStay\n\n\nRecommended publications\nDiscover more\nConference Paper\nCharacterization and Management Practices of Solid Waste Generated from Hotels in Awka City, Nigeria\nJanuary 2023\n\nObiora B.
