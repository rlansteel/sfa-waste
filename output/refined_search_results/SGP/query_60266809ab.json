This is also down year-on-year from 7.4 million tonnes in 2022.\nHowever, the country’s overall recycling rate declined from 62% to 52% between 2013 and 2023. While non-ferrous metal and ferrous metal from construction and demolition each had a recycling rate of 99% last year, just 5% of plastics – 48,000 tonnes – were recycled.\nAdd to this the fact that textile/leather and food had recycling rates of 2% (5,000 tonnes) and 18% (132,000 tonnes) respectively last year, and it becomes clear that the need for a long-term solution to tackle overconsumption is great.\n**Green movements\n**As part of its Zero Waste Masterplan and Green Plan, which were launched in 2019 and 2021 respectively, Singapore aims to improve its overall recycling rate to 70% by 2030. The island, which is just 734.3km2 in size and home to more than six million people, also plans to reduce the amount of waste per capita it sends to landfill by 30%.\n\nSo given that Singapore’s only landfill site, Semakau, is set to be full by 2035, what are the country and wider organisations doing to meet these targets and close the waste loop?\nWhile the National Environment Agency (NEA), Singapore’s government agency in charge of planning, developing and administering the county’s waste management systems, refused various requests to comment, it did highlight a number of ongoing initiatives.\nThese include the establishment of a new alliance aimed at reducing packaging waste in the e-commerce sector and a beverage container return scheme (BCRS) due to launch in 2026.\nThe NEA has also awarded more than S$6m (£3.6m) to three projects aimed at diverting plastic waste from incineration by either improving the recyclability of contaminated and hard-to-recycle plastics, or by developing sustainable packaging solutions that use recycled plastic materials and are easy to recycle.\n**Zero-waste challenges\n**Rémi Cesaro, founder of consultancy Zero Waste City, provides advice to companies in Singapore that are looking to reduce their waste and ultimately achieve zero-waste scores.\n\nCost, habit and caring about waste and recycling are the main challenges for Singapore, he believes. “In the private sector, if the volume of waste is not sufficient, you will most likely have to pay an extra fee to transport it,” Cesaro says. “Even if it’s a small cost, some organisations may be reluctant to pay it.”\nOne new regulation that Cesaro welcomes is the food-waste segregation and reporting framework. Under this, large food-waste producers such as factories, hotels and shopping malls have to segregate their food waste for treatment.\nIn terms of recycling, he highlights the upcoming extended producer responsibility approach for packaging-waste management, which the BCRS will fall under.\nThe lack of visibility in the waste disposal process, which includes segregation, collection, sorting and treatment, is a concern in Singapore, Cesaro says.\n“Cities that tend to be good at achieving zero-waste targets decentralise waste management to make it closer to people so they can see how much waste is being generated. The idea is to mitigate the concept of ‘out of sight, out of mind’, which might drive change.”\nTextile collection\nOne company doing this is Cloop, which collects textiles and apparel for reuse, repurposing and recirculation through its recycling bins, swap events, thrift pop-ups and educational workshops.\nCloop introduced Singapore’s first textile bin as part of a partnership with Life Line Clothing in July 2022, and now has more than 450 bins nationwide.\n\n“These help divert some textile waste away from landfill to a more targeted recycler that will then segregate it into more than 500 categories for international circulation,” co-founder and eco-warrior Jasmine Tuan explains. “It just goes to show how much waste and overconsumption there is in Singapore.”\nTuan believes one reason for the recycling rate decline in recent years is a failed system. “We want to recycle and do the right thing, but the system doesn’t support that behaviour, or consumers don’t have the awareness of who’s doing what,” she says.\n“It doesn’t help that Singapore’s waste management system is primarily dependent on incineration – our four incineration plants produce energy from waste. Now there is also research and development to turn the ash at Semakau landfill into something, so there’s no reason for us to reduce our waste in general. It’s a good solution for Singapore, but it’s not the best. Resources still go to waste here because of convenience and state-of-the-art waste management.”\nFor example, Tuan says students advocate sustainability, but when they segregate waste at school, the cleaners put it all together in a general waste bin that goes straight to incineration. “That discourages people who want to do the right thing, so we have to work together – the system has to help people,” she says.\nSince its creation in 2020, Cloop has collected close to 5,000 tonnes of textiles through its recycling bins and rehomed 23,000 items of clothing at its swap events. The company’s aim, Tuan says, is to double the current textile recycling rate in Singapore.\n“Our vision is to be a go-to resource hub for all things circular fashion, so for any material, or shopping or buying bundle, we have a solution under that one roof. It’s also a space for the community to come together to learn skills from one another – mending or experimenting using fabric waste,” she explains.\nPlastic projects\nBeyond Singapore, ocean impact organisation Seven Clean Seas is on a mission to remove 10 million kilograms of plastic from our oceans by the end of 2025. With numerous plastic crediting projects across South-East Asia, including Indonesia and Thailand, Seven Clean Seas has successfully removed 4.5 million kilograms of plastic so far.\n\n“Our goal is to build projects that intercept and prevent plastic from reaching the environment, as well as clean up plastic that’s already in coastal communities,” says Tom Peacock-Nazil (pictured left), founder and CEO of Seven Clean Seas.\nWhile plastic credits are a useful tool, he says, they don’t replace the need for upstream reduction, investment in the circular economy, or regulations to mandate the reduction of plastic production in the first place.\nOther innovative solutions the company has developed include corrugated roof tiles made out of shopping bags. “Almost all communities in coastal regions in Indonesia are choosing not to use tin because it corrodes in the salt air,” explains Peacock-Nazil. “They were using pure asbestos and had no clue about the negative health implications.\n“Building regulations have now been passed for our corrugated roof tiles to be used in Indonesia. They’ve got the corrosion resistance capabilities that asbestos roofs would have, but they’re made from waste. “At the same time, it’s a mono polymer – low-density polyethylene – so at the end of its life, we can shred it up and mix it with more recycled plastic and turn it into more roof tiles.”  \nIn addition, Peacock-Nazil says: “Our high-density polyethylene bottle caps and polypropylene food pots can get turned into big sheets that we’re now making into furniture and tabletops.”\nFor multi-layered and small-format packaging that’s highly contaminated, he says, Seven Clean Seas is mixing it with sand to make fire-retardant building bricks.  \n“Our recycling rates are sitting at around 15% today, which I’m incredibly proud about considering all the materials are degraded and contaminated,” Peacock-Nazil says. “It also beats the 9% plastic recycling rate globally.”\nThe road ahead\nThe solution for the little red dot, as Singapore is commonly known, lies in regulation, Peacock-Nazil and Cesaro believe.\n“Singapore has this unique scenario where you cannot move the needle in circularity easily,” Peacock-Nazil says. “It needs to be led by regulation. The government has an opportunity to be the world’s best at something and they should continue to invest in it.”\nCesaro agrees: “I’m a big believer in regulation – if you want drastic change quickly, regulation is by far the best way.”\nFor further information about Cloop and Seven Clean Seas respectively, see www.cloop.sg and www.sevencleanseas.com\nKatie Smith is a freelance writer and editor\n\nFenland House,\n15B Hostmoor Avenue,\nMarch,\nCambridgeshire,\nPE15 0AX.\n\n\nCall us:\n+44 (0)1522 540069\n*   ### Email us:\ninfo@iema.net\n\n\nPrivacy\n\nTerms\nCookies\nAccessibility\n\nMake a Complaint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© Copyright The Institute of Sustainability and Environmental Professionals 2025\n(formerly the Institute of Environmental Management and Assessment)\nCompany Limited by Guarantee.

There is no publicly available data for subsequent years.\nBuilding recycling facilities requires land, which is a precious commodity in Singapore.\nMr Cheang Kok Chung, executive director of the Singapore Environment Council, said: “Given the size of Singapore’s domestic market, there may not be sufficient recyclable feedstock to support large recycling facilities that are able to reap economies of scale.\n“Furthermore, some recycling processes can be resource-intensive, in terms of land, water or energy.”\nRecycling facilities, some featuring innovative technologies, have been under development for several years.\nIn 2023, Abraclean, the first recycling plant in Singapore that can repurpose glass waste into an abrasive that removes unwanted coatings such as rust and paint from metal surfaces in industrial applications, was officially opened.\nAbraclean chairman Gurmit Singh said the company has already met the target of recycling 3,500 tonnes of glass waste in May, and that it is in talks to upscale its capabilities to recycle up to 35,000 tonnes of glass waste by processing construction and vehicle glass each year.\nRecycling start-up Magorium was founded in 2019 to turn plastic waste into road construction material.\nIn February 2023, the Land Transport Authority said that it was in discussions with Magorium to trial its bitumen-like product, NewBitumen, on public roads.\nMagorium founder Oh Shu Xian said that the company has paved nine roads – including driveways at the DBS Newton Green building, a condominium in Marymount, and a road near the Sentosa Sensoryscape attraction – and converted close to 100 tonnes of plastic waste into NewBitumen.\nMore on this Topic\naskST: What is recycling contamination, and what can we do about it? Recycle-me-not: What happens when the wrong things get recycled\nInternational developments\nSince the bulk of Singapore’s recyclables have to be exported, the local recycling business is also subject to regulations that govern the transboundary movement of waste.\nThe Basel Convention, enacted in 1998, controls the international movement of hazardous and certain categories of non-hazardous waste such as household waste or residue from the incineration of household waste.\nThe convention was expanded to include contaminated, mixed or non-recyclable plastics in 2021.\nPrior to the amendments, exporters were able to ship contaminated mixed and non-recyclable plastics across Singapore’s borders without obtaining consent from the countries receiving them.\nIn 2018, China’s “National Sword” policy banned the import of most plastics and other materials.\nThe country had previously processed nearly half of the world’s recyclables for more than two decades.\nPrior to the changes, Singapore exported a substantial portion of its recyclables to China for processing. The ban’s restrictions made exporting much more difficult, especially for lower-quality or contaminated materials.\nMore recently, global shipping has been thrown into disarray as ships take longer routes to bypass dangerous attacks in the Red Sea.\nRerouting of shipping routes has led to increased operational costs, such as rises in fuel consumption.\nMs JacQueline Lim, managing director of Tai Hing Group, a local paper recycling company, said current freight costs have increased about three to four times more than usual, which is worse than during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nMs Rheaume said: “These developments mean that transport costs will get pushed up. This makes the cost of purchasing waste materials from Singapore even more expensive, reducing demand for our recyclables.\n“So we can expect this will have a negative impact on recycling rates.”\nGenerating less waste\nSingapore is moving to be more self-sufficient in processing its waste, which could subject recycling companies here to fewer fluctuations in global supply chains. This could, in turn, help lift recycling rates.\nBut Singapore’s recycling infrastructure will take time to improve, given that the development of recycling capabilities and facilities is still in progress.\nTuas Nexus – an integrated waste and water treatment facility that can sort household recyclables and process food waste, on top of treating industrial used water for industrial use – is slated to be completed in phases from 2025 onwards.\nReducing waste should be prioritised instead of relying on recycling, Ms Rheaume said.\nAlready, Singapore’s one and only landfill in Semakau is expected to be fully filled by 2035, instead of 2045.\nThere are already encouraging signs.\nNEA statistics showed that in 2023, each person generated 0.88kg of rubbish a day. This is less than the 0.9kg figure in 2022.\nMs Rheaume said that it was a good sign that the waste generated per person has reduced.\nUnder the Zero Waste Masterplan, Singapore aims to reduce the waste sent to the landfill each day by 30 per cent by 2030, so as to extend the landfill’s lifespan beyond 2035.\nSaid Ms Rheaume: “The bigger problem is consumption in the first place. And we’ve got a lot of consumption. Even really great recycling systems aren’t going to save us from the climate change impact of our consumption.”\nShe added: “Keep finding ways to not use so much single-use material. Avoid single-use glass for sure. Avoid single-use plastic. Don’t just substitute one single-use item for another.”\nMore on this Topic\nOnly 15% of people surveyed are aware of S’pore’s net-zero emission target: Study Smart recycling boxes and lockers for another 83 locations in S’pore\nAlready a subscriber? Log in\nUnlimited coverage, unmatched value\nGet Digital Access\nGet Digital Access\nMonthly Savings  \n$9.90 $5/month\nSubscribe today!\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\nMonthly Recurring  \n$9.90/month\nSubscribe now\nNo lock-in contract.\nSubscriber-exclusive benefits for One Digital Package:\n\nAccess all subscriber-only content on ST app and straitstimes.com.\nEasy access any time via ST app on one mobile device.\nmyST: Follow up to 30 authors and 30 topics.\n\nJoin ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.\nRecyclingWaste managementCommodity marketEnvironmental issuesSustainability\nThanks for sharing!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFROM AROUND THE WEB\n\n Ad Amazon's Worst Nightmare: Thousands Canceling Prime for This Clever Hack Learn More Online Shopping Tools  Ad is Hidden Please tell us why you hid this ad? * Inappropriate * Misleading * Misinformation * Repetitive * Irrelevant * Distracting\n Ad Windows Users Didn't Know This Simple Trick To Block All Ads (Do It Now) Click Here lifestyletechtips.com  Ad is Hidden Please tell us why you hid this ad? * Inappropriate * Misleading * Misinformation * Repetitive * Irrelevant * Distracting\n Ad Windows Users Don't Forget To Do This Before Thursday Read more Securitytipsonline.com  Ad is Hidden Please tell us why you hid this ad? * Inappropriate * Misleading * Misinformation * Repetitive * Irrelevant * Distracting\n Ad A.I.

      "raw_content": "Uncategorized\n\nTop 3 Challenges for Singapore Sustainability in 2023\n\nIn this blog post, we will delve into the top three challenges that Singapore faces in its journey towards sustainability in 2023. As a company committed to revolutionizing recycling and waste management, SG Recycle plays a vital role in addressing these challenges. By using innovative technology, incentives, and education, SG Recycle aims to make recycling easier and more rewarding, motivating individuals to take active steps towards a greener future.\n\nChallenge 1: Motivation\nOne of the major challenges facing sustainability efforts in Singapore is the lack of motivation among individuals to recycle properly and regularly. Many people are simply unaware or indifferent to the importance of recycling. This contributes to low recycling rates, leading to an increase in waste and environmental degradation.\n\nTo address this challenge, SG Recycle has implemented a rewards and gamification system. By incentivizing recycling through cash rewards and other benefits, SG Recycle motivates individuals to actively participate in the recycling process. This not only increases recycling rates but also fosters a sense of community and environmental responsibility.\n\nStatistics show that in Singapore, only a small percentage of households actively engage in recycling. By highlighting these statistics along with compelling examples, SG Recycle can emphasize the importance of motivation in driving sustainability goals.\n\nChallenge 2: Contamination\nContamination refers to the mixing of non-recyclable or dirty items with recyclable materials. This not only reduces the quality and value of recyclables but also poses significant challenges for waste management facilities. High levels of contamination hinder recycling efforts and contribute to environmental pollution.\n\nIn Singapore, contamination rates remain a concern, with individuals often unaware of how their actions impact the recycling process. To address this challenge, SG Recycle focuses on user segregation and education. Through informative campaigns and educational content, they raise awareness about the correct sorting and disposal of recyclable materials. This empowers individuals to actively contribute to improved recycling practices and reduces contamination rates.\n\nBy providing statistics and examples of contamination rates and their sources in Singapore, SG Recycle can demonstrate the severity of the issue and the need for collective action.\n\nChallenge 3: Decarbonisation\nDecarbonisation is crucial for sustainability and recycling efforts. The waste management process often contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, putting a strain on efforts to combat climate change. Singapore, being a densely populated city-state, faces significant challenges in reducing emissions from waste management.\n\nSG Recycle tackles decarbonisation by optimizing waste collection routes and adopting circularity principles. The use of robotic waste collection machines and 100% electric vehicle fleet helps reduce carbon emissions associated with waste management. This sustainable approach aligns with Singapore’s commitment to reducing its carbon footprint and provides a viable solution to the challenge of decarbonisation.\n\nTo highlight the urgency of decarbonisation efforts, SG Recycle can share statistics on emissions from waste management and showcase the positive impact they have made through their innovative practices.\n\nIn summary, Singapore faces several challenges in its pursuit of sustainability in 2023. Motivation, contamination, and decarbonisation stand out as the top three obstacles. However, SG Recycle offers innovative solutions to overcome these challenges.\n\nBy leveraging rewards and gamification, SG Recycle successfully motivates individuals to recycle and actively engage in sustainable practices. Through user segregation and education initiatives, they address the issue of contamination by promoting correct waste disposal methods. Lastly, SG Recycle’s emphasis on decarbonisation through optimized waste collection routes and circularity principles contributes significantly to Singapore’s sustainability goals.\n\nSG Recycle’s mission and commitment to a zero waste, carbon-neutral future align perfectly with Singapore’s sustainability objectives. By joining SG Recycle and supporting their vision, readers can play an active role in overcoming these challenges and make a positive impact on the environment and the future of Singapore.\n\nJoin SG Recycle in creating a sustainable future for Singapore. By recycling paper and participating in their rewards program, you can be part of a community that values the environment and sustainable living. Together, we can overcome the top three challenges and work towards a greener, cleaner tomorrow.\n\nsite-admin-sg\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

The generation and management of municipal solid waste (MSW) are important components for city development, both of which are spatiotemporally heterogeneous among these metropolitans, as a result of diverse socioeconomic statuses. This study attempts to sufficiently reveal the spatiotemporal heterogeneity by determining the MSW per capita, MSW composition, and proportion of each management strategy (landfilling, incineration, and compositing). Singapore is taken for comparison, for it is a Chinese community and well-known for its outstanding performance in environmental sanitation. Results show that MSW per capita is highly dependent on GDP per capita, and exerts an increasing tendency with time, but can be relieved with MSW reduction policy. For each metropolitan, the development of landfilling and incineration fits the Kuznets curve well, and government policy is a more determinant factor than GDP. MSW composition is also time- and location-dependent, and source sorting generally favors the subsequent resource utilization including the mainstream incineration. In addition to MSW generation and management, the action, goal, and experience in Singapore are expatiated, which are believed to be of referential significance for these metropolitans.\n\nPrevious article in issue\nNext article in issue\n\nKeywords\nMunicipal solid waste (MSW)\nMetropolitan\nWaste management\nChina\nSingapore\n1. Introduction\nAs the largest developing country worldwide, China has experienced rapid population growth and urbanization in the last decades. The population increases by over 1.0 × 108 every decade, reaching 14.1 × 108 in 2020 (Fig. 1(A)). The urbanization rate reached 63.9% in 2020 (Fig. 1(A)), which means that over 9.0 × 108 people currently live in the city pursuing a better life. The rapid urbanization gives birth to four world-class megalopolises, namely, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region, Changjiang Delta Region, Zhujiang Delta Region, and Chengdu-Chongqing Economic Circle, all of which contribute significantly to China's development from economics to politics, culture, and society (Liao et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2016). These megalopolises are heterogeneously located in different regions of China, and contain several metropolitan, e.g., Beijing (BJ), Shanghai (SH), Guangzhou (GZ), Shenzhen (SZ), Tianjin (TJ), and Chongqing (CQ).\n\n\nDownload: Download high-res image (606KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\n\nFig. 1. (A) Population and urbanization rate; (B) GDP and GDP per captia in China from 1980 to 2020; (C) MSW mass; and (D) proportions of incineration, landfilling, composting, and improper disposal for MSW in China from 2002 to 2020. All data are collected from the latest National Bureau of Statistic of China (NBSC, 2021).\nOne of the inevitable issues for city development is municipal solid waste (MSW) management, which is highly dependent on the mass (Fig. 1(C)) and composition. The MSW mass per capita (MSWmp) is of interest because it is a core indicator of the environmental pressure induced by MSW generation, and contributes to better MSW management planning. MSWmp in developed countries is mainly distributed within 0.52–0.76 t/a, but 0.11–0.53 t/a in developing countries (Karak et al., 2012). China's GDP grew and tended to accelerate after 2000 (Fig. 1(B)), and steadily ranks second worldwide since 2010. The GDP per capita is ∼200 USD in 1980, and increased by ∼500 times to ∼11,000 USD in 2020. There are other factors influencing the MSWmp, e.g., geographical location, habits and customs, and resident average age. It has been previously reported that the MSWmp discrepancy in two countries with almost equal GDP per capita can reach 0.4 t (Eurostat, 2021). The variability of MSWmp in typical Chinese cities has been reported (Han et al., 2016; Xiao et al., 2020), but not properly correlated with socioeconomic factors.\nSanitary management of the generated MSW is crucial for modern city development. On a national scale, 99.8% of MSW was sanitarily disposed of in 2020, which is significantly higher than 54.2% in 2002. Landfilling and incineration are two main strategies that contribute to sanitary management, but their development trends are different (Chen et al., 2010). The landfilling proportion shrinked after 2012 and reached 33.2% in 2020, whereas incineration developed rapidly and its proportion was 62.0% in 2020 (Fig. 1(D)). Likewise, the sanitary management and strategy evolution should be variable among different cities as a result of varied socioeconomic factors, but has not been extensively explored.\nIn addition to the rapid development of incineration, another mainstream direction for MSW management is source sorting. The promulgations of China's Work Plan on Zero-waste City Pilot Program and revised law of Environmental Pollution Prevention Caused by Solid Waste call for source sorting. In 2021, the 14th Five-Year Plan on MSW Sorting and Treatment Facility was launched to promote national source sorting (Shenzhen Circular Economy Information Platform, 2020). The average MSW recovery rate in 46 major cities was only 30.4% by 2020 (National Development and Reform Commission of China, 2020), as a result of lacking source sorting. In comparison, Singapore is well-known for its outstanding performance in environmental sanitation. Recently, Singapore government promulgates the Zero Waste Masterplan to achieve 70% recycling rate by 2030 (MEWR, 2023). Experience and action from Singapore are perhaps of referential significance for China.\nUsing the above mentioned six metropolitans as the research areas, the first work of this study is to explore the spatiotemporal heterogeneities of MSW generation and management by considering various socioeconomic factors. For MSW generation, MSW mass and MSWmp after 2000 are collected for comparison because results in Fig. 1(B) show that GDP was accelerated since then. With regard to MSW management, the sanitary management proportion and each strategy contribution are presented in the same time period. Afterward, this study concentrates on source sorting, including the disclosure of its effect on MSW composition, the comparison of models between typical metropolitan and Singapore, and finally the generalization of valuable enlightenment. This study contributes to the comprehensive understanding and promotion the MSW management in China.\n2. MSW and main socioeconomic factors in metropolitans\n2.1. Brief introduction of the metropolitans\nBJ, SH, TJ, and CQ are four province-level municipalities across China that are directly under central government. Both BJ and TJ are located in northern China and belong to the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region, and TJ is about 137 km to BJ. As the capital, BJ is China's political center, cultural center, international communication center, and technological innovation center. SH is located in eastern China and belongs to the Changjiang Delta Region. SH is China's economic center, financial center, trade center, international shipping center, and another technological innovation center. GZ is the capital city of Guangdong Province, located in southern China, and belongs to the Zhujiang Delta Region. SZ is the sub-provincial city in Guangdong Province, and is about 137 km to GZ. Besides, SZ is one of the six special economic zones established in 1979, and its rapid development is attributed to the national policy of Economic Reform and Opening Up. CQ is a central city located in southwest China and belongs to the Chengdu-Chongqing Region. More information is shown in Table 1. In addition to their heterogeneous locations, land areas in these metropolitans vary distinctly. As can be seen, land area in SZ ranks the last, which is only a fortieth of that in CQ.\nTable 1. Detailed information with regard to the metropolitans in China.\n| Metropolitan | Geographical location | City orientation | Land area (km2) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BJ | Northern China | Capital/province-level municipality | ∼16,410 |\n| SH | Eastern China | Province-level municipality | ∼6,340 |\n| GZ | Southern China | Province capital | ∼7,434 |\n| SZ | Southern China | Special economic zone | ∼1,998 |\n| TJ | Northern China | Province-level municipality | ∼11,967 |\n| CQ | Southwest China | Province-level municipality | ∼82,402 |\n2.2. MSW generation\nMSW masses of the six metropolitans are shown in Fig. 2(A) from 2002 to 2020, which tend to increase, except for SH during 2014–2016. This is because various policies, e.g., the restriction of excessive packaging and encouragement of green consumption, were implemented around 2012–2013 by SH government to decrease MSW generation. A rebound of MSW mass after 2016 should be ascribed to the weakening of these policies, because the urban population tended to stabilize around 2016 (Fig. 2(B)). The MSW mass in BJ and SH are generally higher as a result of the higher urban population (Fig. 2(B)) and GDP (Fig. 2(C)). MSW mass in TJ is the least because the urban population (Fig. 2(B)) and GDP (Fig. 2(C)) rank amongst the last. With regard to SZ and CQ, they are a little different. MSW mass in SZ ranks third, while its population ranks last and its GDP is comparable to GZ. Both MSW mass and GDP in CQ rank after GZ, while the urban population is almost comparable to that of BJ. All these results indicate that MSW generation is possibly more dependent on GDP than population.\n\n\nDownload: Download high-res image (875KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\n\nFig. 2. (A) MSW mass generated, (B) population, (C) GDP, (D) MSWmp as a function of time, and (E) MSWmp as a function of GDP per capita in BJ, SH, GZ, SZ, TJ, and CQ from 2002 to 2020.\nTo eliminate the influence of population on the spatiotemporal analysis of MSW mass, MSWmp was calculated, as shown in Fig. 2(D). Based on the value of MSWmp, these metropolitans can be divided into two clusters. The first cluster is composed of BJ, SH, GZ, and SZ, and the remaining two metropolitans constitute the second cluster. MSWmp in the first cluster is mostly within 0.35–0.50 t/a, but 0.15–0.25 t/a for the second cluster. This is not surprising because the metropolitans in the first cluster are first-tier in China. MSWmp in SZ is among the highest, which is possibly attributed to the fact that people in SZ are the youngest. According to the 7th national census, only 5.33% of the people in SZ are >60 years old, whereas the proportions are 19.63%, 23.38%, 11.41%, 21.66%, and 21.87% for BJ, SH, GZ, TJ, and CQ, respectively. One of the lifestyles that the youngsters prefer is take-out service, and SZ is reported to have the highest occupation of take-out service. The take-out service has been condemned for causing plastics pollution (Li et al., 2016). MSWmp in SH tends to decrease in the investigated period, indicating that SH performed well in the reduction of MSW mass. The representative actions to reduce the MSW mass in SH are shown in Table S1 which is in the Electronic Supplementary Material (ESM) in the online version of this paper.\nThe dependence of MSW generation on GDP is further evidenced by the results in Fig. 2(E). As can be seen, higher GDP per capita (GDPp) tends to correlate with higher MSWmp. For example, with GDPp increasing from 0.1 × 104 USD (CQ) to 2.8 × 105 USD (SZ), the MSWmp increases obviously from 0.15 t/a to 0.56 t/a. With equal GDPp, the MSWmp varies distinctly among the metropolitans. MSWmp in the second cluster is generally less than that in the first cluster. Different from BJ, GZ, and SZ, MSWmp in SH tends to decrease with the increment of GDPp, which further proved the good performance of a series of MSW mass reduction policies.\n3. MSW management and discussion\n3.1. MSW composition and the effect of source sorting\nRaw composition of the MSW is shown in Table 2. Generally, MSW in all metropolitans is rich in food residual, followed by paper and plastics & rubber. These three compositions are combustible, and in most cases, account for ≥90 wt% of the total MSW, which makes incineration advantageous and gradually predominant in the sanitary treatment of MSW. The MSW in Singapore exhibits similar composition (Zhang et al., 2010). For each of the MSW composition, it is spatially heterogeneous among the metropolitans. The amount of paper and plastics & rubber are obviously higher in SZ, and the food residual proportion is always <45 wt%. The highly-developed commercial environment in SZ makes young people prefer the take-out service to home-made food. Similar to SZ, MSW in GZ contains less food waste, but the plastics & rubber is more abundant. This might be because GZ is a international trade center, and the world-famous “China Import and Export Fair” is annually held there.\nTable 2. MSW compositions (wt.%) of the six metropolitans prior to sorting.\n| Metropolitan | Food residue | Paper | Plastics & rubber | Textile | Wood | Non-combustible | Reference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BJ (2010) | 64.9 | 12.9 | 15.1 | 3.1 | 1.5 | 2.5 | Duan et al.

As can be seen, food residual proportion is lower after source sorting. This is ascribed to the separated processing mode under new source sorting rule, which is developed from the traditional mixed incineration mode. The typical scenarios for these two modes are shown in Fig. 3 (Wang et al., 2021b). As can be seen, their major difference is that food waste is classified to the category of exclusive waste-to-resource in the second mode. For food residual proportion in the residual waste, SH ranks the lowest among the three metropolitans, which might indicate the high-quality source sorting.\nTable 3.

Scenarios for MSW disposal modes (A) before and (B) after source sorting.\nSource sorting benefits the incineration process mainly by removing food waste, which accounts for the largest proportion of MSW mass (40%–60%) (Ding et al., 2021; Turan et al., 2009). On the one hand, the decrement of MSW mass entering the incinerator is favorable to relieve the burden. On the other hand, food waste removal is favorable to increase the caloricity by avoiding the incomplete incineration and heat loss as a result of H2O evaporation. Due to the high H2O content (>70%), food waste is the main H2O source in MSW (Pham et al., 2015). In this case, exterior carbon is not required to maintain steady incineration. After the food waste is removed, MSW caloricity is comparable to those in developed regions or countries, e.g., EU, USA, and Japan (Fang & Li, 2019). The increased caloricity generates additional heat for electricity, further making up for the MSW incineration cost. Meanwhile, it is reported that source sorting significantly decreases the formation of dioxin in MSW incineration (Shi et al., 2008).\n3.2. MSW management: The unusual SH\nMSW could cause severe water, air, and soil pollution if improperly treated (Levis et al., 2017; Wiedinmyer et al., 2014). Therefore, its sanitary treatment is crucial for city development. The mass of sanitarily treated MSW (_m_eMSW) increases in each metropolitan (Fig. 4(A)) as a result of the enlargement of MSW sanitary treatment capacity (_Q_MSW, Fig. S1 in ESM). However, the sanitary treatment percentage of MSW (_η_MSW) is spatiotemporally heterogeneous, in which the performances of SH and CQ are the least satisfactory. As shown in Fig. 4(B), _η_MSW of SH and CQ increased rapidly in the early years, but they were obviously lower than those of the other four metropolitans. Increment of _η_MSW is possibly ascribed to the improved utilization of _Q_MSW because _Q_MSW did not enlarge in either SH or CQ prior to 2012 (Fig. S1 in ESM).\n\n\nDownload: Download high-res image (702KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\n\nFig. 4. (A) _m_eMSW, (B) _η_MSW, (C) _m_iMSW, and (D) total _m_iMSW in BJ, SH, GZ, SZ, TJ, and CQ from 2002 to 2020.\nThe pollution caused by MSW can be long-time and is directly dependent on the improperly-treated MSW mass (_m_iMSW). For each metropolitan, _m_iMSW is shown in the investigated time period in Fig. 4(C). As can be seen, _m_iMSW in SH is far higher than those in other metropolitans before 2014. Within the whole investigated time period, the overall _m_iMSW in SH is 3.2 × 107 t, which is one order of magnitude higher than those in BJ with 5.6 × 106 t, GZ with 4.0 × 106 t, SZ with 3.8 × 106 t, TJ with 3.8 × 106 t, and CQ with 9.1 × 106 t, respectively (Fig. 4(D)). All these results indicate that SH is historically lacking in the management of generated MSW, while its economy is pioneering. These historically improperly-treated MSW should be taken seriously, especially for SH.\n3.3. Strategies for MSW management: Kuznets curve\nTechnologies that contribute to the sanitary treatment of MSW in each metropolitan are depicted in Fig. 5(A), 5(B), 5(C), 5(D), 5(E), and 5(F). For BJ and SH, in addition to incineration and landfilling, the contribution of composting cannot be neglected. As can be seen, the composting proportion in BJ was >10% after 2010, and reached 22.4% in 2020. Composting in SH is heterogeneously developed, and its proportion was maximized in 2010 reaching 16.4%. For the remaining metropolitans, incineration and landfilling are two overwhelming technologies, and composting is rarely applied. Since organic waste in the MSW is usually not source sorted, additional sorting equipment or manual works, on a small scale, are required to separate the proper organics prior to composting (Chen et al., 2010). This process generates additional cost and makes composting less competitive in price compared with fertilizer. It is expected that composting will gain further development with better source sorting. If the results in Fig. 2(A) are co-considered, it could be feasibly deduced the heterogeneity of applied sanitary technologies in different regions across China.\n\n\nDownload: Download high-res image (988KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\n\nFig. 5. Proportions of landfilling, incineration, composting, and improper disposal of MSW in (A) BJ, (B) SH, (C) GZ, (D) SZ, (E) TJ, and (F) CQ from 2002 to 2020. Proportions of (G) landfilling and (H) incineration as a function of time, and proportions of (I) landfilling and (J) incineration as a function of GDP per capita in each metropolitan.\nLandfilling and incineration are two major technologies responsible for sanitary treatment of MSW. As shown in Fig. 5(G), the landfilling proportion and time are of a uniformly inverted-U-shaped for each metropolitan, indicating that landfilling occupation first increased during the early stage, and then declined at a threshold. Thresholds in most of these metropolitans centered at around 2017–2018, while it is relatively ambiguous for either BJ or CQ. Incineration develops rapidly and accelerates in recent years, especially after 2017. In particular, incineration development in SZ appears to be more radical than in the other five metropolitans (Fig. 5(H)). For example, in the year 2007, 35.8% of the MSW in SZ was incinerated, which is obviously higher than the proportions in BJ, SH, and GZ, which are only 6.5%, 15.6%, and 11.1%, respectively. Incineration is preferred in SZ largely because of its small land area (Table 1). China's first MSW incineration plant was built in SZ in 1988 (Zheng et al., 2014). Incineration is expected to become more prevalent nationwide, accompanied by further shrinking of landfilling in the near further.\nThe proportions of landfilling and incineration as a function of GDPp are shown in Fig. 5(I) and 5(J), respectively. For each metropolitan, a similar inverted-U-shaped relationship is observed between landfilling proportion and GDPp, conforming to the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC). According to the mainstream EKC hypothesis, environmental pressure tends to rise faster than income growth in the early stage of economic development, and then slows down, reaches a threshold, and declines with further income growth (He & Lin, 2019). However, the thresholds vary distinctly. Arranged in descending patterns, the order tends to be SZ, BJ, SH, GZ, TJ, and CQ, and the thresholds in BJ, SH, and GZ are quite close to each other. With regard to incineration, the threshold order is similar (Fig. 5(H) and 5(J)). It is thus feasibly deduced that the economic level is perhaps not a determinant for choosing the technology.\nDevelopment of the MSW incineration industry with representative government actions is shown in Fig. 6, and the whole history can be divided into three periods, namely, initial exploration stage, tentative improvement stage, and rapid development stage. With financial and political support from the government for nearly 25 years, these metropolitans are well-prepared for the rapid incineration development after 2011. Therefore, government policy might be the most important factor in MSW management. Incineration benefits city development by reducing the MSW mass by 65%–80% and volume by 85%–90% (Bertolini et al., 2004), which could save land for city development, and transform the MSW into electricity for further usage.\n\n\nDownload: Download high-res image (919KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\n\nFig. 6. Development history of MSW incineration with the representative government actions in China.\n3.4. The experience of MSW management in Singapore\nMSWmp in the latest four years is shown in Fig. 7(A), which seems slightly lower to those in the first cluster of metropolitans within the same time period (Fig. 2(D)). Prevention of waste generation has been given priority in sustainable MSW management, especially in developed countries (Soltanian et al., 2022). MSWmp is not extended to a wider time period because with regard to the annual mass of generated solid waste, MSW was not distinguished from other wastes, e.g., industrial waste and construction waste, before 2016. In Singapore, landfilling and incineration are historically the two main technologies for MSW sanitary management, which is quite similar to the situation in China. Their relative proportions are shown in Fig. 7(B). As can be seen, prior to 1978, landfilling was almost the only technology applied. Incineration has been developing rapidly since 1980 when the first incineration plant was built. As a result, incineration and landfilling equally took over the overall MSW sanitary treatment in the year 1986. After rapid development for 20 years, incineration proportion was maximized in 2000 and has been stabilized ever since. To further facilitate sustainable development, recycling has been gradually given priority, which calls for better source sorting. The overall recycling rate reached 60% in 2012, and Singapore plans to further increase it to 70% by 2030 (Fig. 7(C)).\n\n\nDownload: Download high-res image (602KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\n\nFig. 7. (A) MSWmp, (B) proportions of landfilling and incineration on MSW disposal as a function of time, (C) MSW recycling rate together with the target in the near future, and (D) MSW disposal mode involving source sorting in Singapore.\nMSW management in Singapore is well developed, and the whole waste collection and transportation system is divided into two sub-systems shown in Fig. 7(D). The two systems are public waste collection system (PWCs) targeting waste generated by the resident, and general waste collection system (GWCs) targeting waste from industrial and commercial activities. Source sorting takes a determinant role in the success of both systems, and most of the work is done by specialized companies. The resident does not need to strictly classify the MSW, but will be sternly fined if waste is illegally dumped. An attempt has been made by Singapore government to classify the MSW in the resident community, which is quite similar to China's current sorting mode, but has made little progress. In this case, the role of the government is crucial to supervise the company activity, as well as support these companies financially and politically if needed. With enhanced sorting, the fee paid for incineration plant can be minimized, and the company can further profit from selling recycled items. Under the incentive of economic profit, the company updated its technology and management for sorting and recycling. Thanks to this system, less than 3.7 × 105 t of the solid residual out of 77 × 105 t MSW after incineration is annually disposed of at Semakau Landfill.\nTo achieve 70% recycling of the MSW, diverse policies and programs have been formulated and implemented, in most cases, targeting specific waste, e.g., food waste, e-waste, and packaging waste. For example, to better deal with food waste, Singapore is now making effort to co-digest it with sewage sludge, but on the premise of source sorting to the most (National Environmental Agency, 2018). To deal with the increasing e-waste, the Regulated E-waste Management System based on extended producer responsibility was implemented to promote e-waste collection and proper treatment (National Environmental Agency, 2023). It is expected that the achievement of this short-term goal is highly dependent on enhanced MSW sorting from the source.\nProportions of landfilling and incineration are plotted for the metropolitans as a function of time, and the results are shown in Fig. 8. It is interesting to find that in each metropolitan, the incineration occupation surpasses that of landfilling uniformly in the years 2017–2018, which is consistent with the above-mentioned conclusion that government policy is the most important factor in MSW management. In SH, landfilling was not adopted until 2002 (Fig. 4(B)), which caused its lower occupation than incineration before 2006. In GZ, in both 2008 and 2013, the incineration proportion was quite close to that of landfilling, but did not surpass.\n\n\nDownload: Download high-res image (614KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\n\nFig. 8. Proportions of landfilling and incineration on MSW sanitary disposal as a function of time in (A) BJ, (B) SH, (C) GZ, (D) SZ, (E) TJ, and (F) CQ.\nWith regard to incineration, the time interval is 6 years in Singapore between the first plant establishment (1980) and the 50% occupation achievement (1986). In comparison, time intervals in the metropolitans are longer. For example, time interval is about 30 years in SZ, which was the location of China's first MSW incineration plant built in the year 1988. Even though the economy develops rapidly, China, including these metropolitans, is still underdeveloped, especially before the year 2000. The socioeconomic status makes China prefer landfilling to incineration for MSW disposal. Singapore spent 14 years enlarging the incineration proportion from 50% (1986) to > 90% (2000). However, the corresponding time is anticipated to be shorter in these metropolitans. For example, in the year 2019, the incineration proportion in SZ reached 93.4%. The metropolitans are well-developed in recent years, which greatly favors the rapid incineration development.\n4. Conclusions\nIn this study, six metropolitans, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Tianjin, and Chongqing, which are located at four world-class megalopolises across China, are selected to reveal the spatiotemporal heterogeneities of MSW generation and management. Singapore is taken for comparison, for it is a Chinese community and well-known for its outstanding performance in environmental sanitation. It is found that these metropolitans are spatiotemporally heterogeneous in MSW per capita, MSW composition, and sanitary management strategy (landfilling, incineration, and composting). For the first four metropolitans, the MSW per capita is distributed within 0.35–0.50 t/a, but 0.15–0.25 t/a for the remaining two metropolitans. MSW per capita increased with time, especially after the year 2000, because the increment of the GDP per capita has accelerated since then. Results in this study also show that official MSW mass reduction policy is effective to relieve the MSW per capita increment. The development patterns of landfilling and incineration fit to the Kuznets curve well in each metropolitan, and the government policy is more determinant a factor than GDP in sanitary management strategy adoption. With regard to the MSW composition, it is also time- and location-dependent, and the dependencies are explored. Meanwhile, source sorting reduces the proportion of food residue, and its significance in subsequent resource utilization was discussed. Incineration develops much more rapidly in these metropolitans compared to that in Singapore because this technology is mature, and these cities are highly developed. Finally, based on the goal, action, and experience relevant to Singapore MSW management, Chinese metropolitans should be more delicacy in environmental sanitation.\nDeclaration of competing interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 52100152 and 52200208), and Natural Science Foundation of Shenzhen Science and Technology Commission (Grant No. RCBS20210609103644013).

This study tailored three types of alkali-activated materials (AAMs) by using ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS) and metakaolin (MK) for the low-carbon stabilization/solidification (S/S) of MSWI FA. The intricate interactions between MSWI FA and AAMs synthesized from Al-rich precursors and Ca-rich precursors were investigated to elucidate the microstructural alterations of AAM-MSWI FA systems. Comprehensive characterization techniques were conducted, including isothermal calorimeter, thermal gravimetric analysis, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and 27Al and 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The results revealed that the incorporation of MSWI FA significantly delayed alkali activation reactions, hindering the formation of aluminosilicate gel due to high contents of Cl and potentially toxic elements (PTEs) in the MSWI FA. High volume of dissolved Cl from MSWI FA would react with available Ca from MSWI FA and GGBS as well as Al from GGBS and MK to form Friedel’s salt, and this reaction was found to be more dominant in the Al-rich environment. Meanwhile, the C-(N-)A-S-H gel exhibited longer chain length in the Al-rich environment than in the Ca-rich environment. Overall, this study delivers microstructural insights into AAM-MSWI FA systems utilizing GGBS and MK as precursors. The results provide scientific groundwork for diverse practical applications of AAM-MSWI FA materials, thereby supporting the development of resource-efficient and low-carbon hazardous waste treatment strategies.\n\n\nDurability and micromechanical properties of biochar in biochar-cement composites under marine environment\n2024, Journal of Cleaner Production\nCitation Excerpt :\nConsidering the decarbonization ability of biochar, incorporating biochar in the cementitious system to develop biochar-cement composites presents a win-win strategy (Li and Xu, 2022; Khajuria et al., 2022). This facilitates sustainable waste management and transforms construction materials into carbon sinks, thereby reducing the overall carbon footprints (Chen et al., 2022; He et al., 2023; Zeng et al., 2022). Moreover, the capacity of biochar has been acknowledged to regulate the workability, improve the compressive strength, and strengthen the impermeability of construction materials through pore filling, internal curing, and providing nucleation sites (Chen et al., 2022; Gupta et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022).\nShow abstract\nIntegrating biochar into traditional construction materials presents a promising avenue to reduce carbon emissions from the construction industry. While recent research has focused on the performance of biochar-cement materials, limited attention is given to the durability of biochar in cementitious materials. This study investigated the alterations in the structural, chemical, and mechanical properties of biochar in the cementitious system and marine environment. The results showed an increased pore size in the biochar and a potential collapse of its structure after long-term exposure of biochar to an alkaline cement environment. The decline of the aromaticity, 23.8% increase in matrix defectiveness, and formation of organometallic complexes between Ca2+ and oxygen-containing functional groups of biochar indicated that its interactions with hydrated cement would lead to the changes in its chemical properties. The exposure of biochar to the simulated cement solution reduced its Young’s modulus from 3.81 GPa to 1.55 GPa and hardness from 0.70 GPa to 0.13 GPa possibly due to the collapse of the pore structure. The saponification reaction might disrupt the cross-linking network structure constructed by COOC and C–O–C in the biochar and release the fulvic-acid organics, causing a decrease in the short- and long-term rebound ratios by 5.6–25.6% and 5–17%, respectively. Biochar exposed to the simulated harsh environment (seawater) exhibited an increase in Young’s modulus and hardness by ∼40% compared to virgin biochar. The long-term rebound ratio reached 96.6–99.2% due to brucite, NaCl, and KCl deposition and filling, implying the potential advantage of biochar-cement composites for long-term durability in the marine environment. These findings contribute new insights to the assessment of mechanical performance and durability of biochar-cement composites in diverse environmental conditions.\n\n\nUnderstanding the setting behaviours of alkali-activated slag from the dissolution-precipitation point of view\n2024, Cement and Concrete Composites\nShow abstract\nGround granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS) is widely used as supplementary cementitious material of interest for adjusting the performance of concrete. Unlike standard commercial products, characteristics of GGBS from different iron manufacturers vary significantly and assessment of its reactivity, especially at an early age, is not well-established despite numerous parameters specified in current standard systems. Three GGBSs with different setting features during the alkali-activated process were dissolved in either deionised (DI) water or NaOH solution in this study. To illustrate the fundamental processes of reaction kinetic, the dissolved ion concentrations, glassy structural changes, and chemically bound water were measured using ICP-OES, FTIR, and TG respectively. Meanwhile, thermodynamic calculations were carried out to estimate the precipitation of C–S–H gels, which is directly linked with setting behaviours. The results clearly show the differences in the dissolution of the three GGBSs, which could be used to indicate the activity of GGBS. The GGBS with higher activity (i.e. faster setting during alkali activation) tends to dissolve evenly in DI water, whilst those with lower activity show that the silicate groups with lower polymerisation dissolved faster. The chemically bound water determined by TG analysis and the effective saturation index (ESI) are promising parameters for reflecting the activity of GGBS during dissolution in the alkali media. Although this study demonstrated the dissolution rate of higher polymerised silicate groups in GGBS should be the root for the differences in its activity, more structural information on the glassy phase and the interactions of alkali with the surface of GGBS still require further understanding. It is speculated that the ratio of Al[IV]/Al[V] plays an important role in the activity of GGBS. This finding may shape a certain basic understanding of how GGBSs dissolve in neutral and high pH solutions and highlight a re-evaluation of assumptions in thermodynamic simulation under different conditions.\n\n\nImprovement of shrinkage resistance and mechanical property of cement-fly ash-slag ternary blends by shrinkage-reducing polycarboxylate superplasticizer\n2024, Journal of Cleaner Production\nShow abstract\nFly ash and slag are two commonly used supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) in modern concrete, which can significantly enhance the long-term durability of concrete. However, their application is somewhat limited due to the negative impact on early strength development and shrinkage cracking. This study proposed using a recently developed shrinkage-reducing polycarboxylate admixture (SR-PCA) to alleviate the above problems. The effect of SR-PCA on compressive strength, drying shrinkage, autogenous shrinkage, mass loss, pore structure and hydration process were also investigated. The results showed that SR-PCA enhanced the 28d compressive strength due to the refinement of pore structure and improved hydration degree. With the addition of SR-PCA, the drying shrinkage and autogenous shrinkage were significantly reduced, particularly in the mixture blended with 50% fly ash, while showing a slight impact in the sample with 50% slag. SR-PCA decreased the drying shrinkage by lowering the hydrous compressibility factor (CF) value and mesopore volumetric percentage. The incorporation of SR-PCA retarded cement hydration at an early age, thereby reducing the early-age autogenous shrinkage, while the long-term autogenous shrinkage was mitigated due to the enhancement effect on the hydration degree at 28 days. Therefore, SR-PCA is a practical approach for enhancing shrinkage resistance and compressive strength in cement-fly ash-slag blends, thereby contributing to the broader application of these industrial by-products.\n\n\nEffect of the incorporation ratio of recycled concrete aggregate on the properties of self-compacting mortar\n2024, Cement and Concrete Composites\nCitation Excerpt :\nWith aging of the built stock and increasing demand for improved living environments, some buildings are forced to be demolished, thus generating large amounts of construction waste [7]. Managing such a substantial volume of construction waste is a complex task that requires significant financial resources; furthermore, improper disposal practices, such as direct disposal on land, can lead to environmental pollution [8]. Finding sustainable solutions for handling construction waste has become a pressing global issue, garnering widespread attention.\nShow abstract\nThis paper investigates the effect of the addition of recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) on the properties of self-compacting cement-based materials at the mortar scale, at the incorporation ratios of 0, 25, 50, and 100 %. The results showed that the yield stress and the plastic viscosity of the mortar increased with the incorporation ratio of RCA. Slump flow and V-funnel time were used to assess these properties. The mechanical strength of the mix also increases with the RCA incorporation ratio. A quantitative analysis of the data demonstrated that the effect of the addition of RCA on the mortar's rheological properties can be attributed to a decrease of the aggregate's packing density (morphology effect), a decrease of the effective water-to-cement ratio of the mix (water-to-cement ratio effect), and an increase of the aggregate's effective volume fraction (volume fraction effect). The latter two effects are caused by the aggregate's high water absorption, whose impact on mechanical strength is stronger than that caused by the morphology effect. In addition, the increase of the mix's strength can also be attributed to the increase of the effective water-to-cement ratio of the mix and to the bonding quality between the aggregate and the cementitious matrix. The increment in the incorporation ratio of RCA causes a reduction of the effective water-cement ratio of the mix and an increase of the bonding quality.\n\n\nContradict mechanism of long-term magnesium and sodium sulfate attacks of nano silica-modified cement mortars – Experimental and thermodynamic modeling\n2024, Cement and Concrete Composites\nCitation Excerpt :\nPozzolanic materials are increasingly being used as the replacement of cement clinker to reduce CO2 emissions without compromising the concrete properties, which is regarded as the most effective way to achieve sustainable concrete – one that has a significantly lower carbon footprint than a best practice or business-as-usual mix for a given application at a given place and time while maintaining adequate durability and mechanical performance [1]. Considering that the amount of Portland cement produced annually worldwide reaches 4.2 billion tonnes (contributing to 8–10% of the global anthropogenic CO2 footprint) [2,3], there is indeed significant potential to replace the clinker by using pozzolanic materials and/or recycled construction materials more appropriately and efficiently [4–7]. Nano silica is one of these emerging SCMs that shows a beneficial effect in concrete on mechanical strength due to the ‘filler effect’ and pozzolanic reactivity, in particular, new nucleation sites for more C–S–H formation, which refines the pore structure [8].\nShow abstract\nThe mechanisms of external sulfate attack on cement mortars containing nano silica have been studied under full immersion conditions after 3 years. The sulfate degradation processes were compared between sodium sulfate and magnesium sulfate solutions with nano-silica replacements of 0, 1, and 8 wt% in CEM I Portland cement. Expansion, mass/strength loss, and microstructural alterations (spatial distribution of secondary phases and chemical compositions on C–S–H) of the degraded mortar were experimentally studied. The solution information was estimated from thermodynamic modeling, which was further used to predict the phase assemblage and the formation and expansion pressure of ettringite. The results showed that the degradation mechanisms were completely contradicted between the exposure solutions: the addition of nano silica increased the sulfate resistance in sodium sulfate solutions, the predicted low crystallization pressure resulted in low expansion, whereas the reduced sulfate resistance in magnesium sulfate solutions occurred where decalcification played a major role.\n\n\nView all citing articles on Scopus\n© 2023 The Author(s).

Abstract: Singapore, as a small but advanced urban economy, has achieved a high-quality living environment and has become an example of a high-density and sustainable city. To maintain that status, Singapore has set a goal of achieving net zero carbon emissions by mid-century and reducing waste sent to landfills by 30% by 2030. To achieve this goal, the Government has laid out a comprehensive plan for implementing a circular economy model across all economic sectors. It includes a set of measures tailored to its unique city-state conditions that will necessarily require the joint effort of authorities, industry, companies, academia, and citizens. This article reviewed and analyzed the strategies and policies that Singapore has devised to implement such a model in four sectors identified as the highest priority by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Economic Community: waste management, food and agriculture, energy, and transportation. The analysis aimed to provide information to close the gap between aspirations and reality by identifying factors that allow progress toward planned objectives, as well as externalities and barriers that act in the opposite direction. For this endeavor, a gap analysis was carried out to look into the interconnections between the natural environment, regulatory framework and policies, governance, infrastructure, technology and innovation, and societal habits. In general, the institutional framework necessary for the transition into a resilient and resource-efficient nation is already in place, while enforcement and monitoring mechanisms to assess progress are under construction. Singapore has learned how to develop policies that are flexible and can adapt to technological, economic, and social changes, as well as threats posed by climate change, and unexpected challenges. Still, success will be determined by Singaporeans’ ability to change their work-life balance paradigm for their own sake and happiness. Keywords: sustainability; environmental resilience; resource-efficient; net zero emissions; zero waste 111 Urban Resilience and Sustainability Volume 2, Issue 2, 110–150. 1. Introduction The city-state of Singapore is widely recognized for its environmental achievements and often cited as a model of a high-density, livable, and sustainable city. Through a unique strategy based on integrated urban and industrial planning, strict enforcement programs, pragmatic and cost-effective policies, and a flexible approach to changes in technology have allowed Singapore to achieve a dynamic economy and a high-quality living environment. Since its inception as an independent nation, Singapore understood the importance of solving environmental problems for the physical and mental well-being of its population, as well as being a key strategy for convincing foreign investors that it is a well-planned and sustainable city [1]. Despite increased urbanization and industrialization, Singapore has been able to simultaneously achieve a clean environment, social inclusion, and economic progress. Nevertheless, Singapore recognizes the need to replace the current linear economic model of “take-make-dispose” by a circular one, in which reducing consumption and production of resources is a priority. This new model focuses on designing waste out of the resource ecosystem and maximizing the value of resources by keeping them in use for as long as possible. Singapore has already embraced the circular economy approach in some sectors, achieving success in closing a number of resource loops. For instance, Singapore is able to endlessly recycle water, reusing it again and again. Every drop of used water is collected and treated, turning much of it into drinking water again [2]. In such a context, the circular economy approach has become part of Singapore’s national agenda. The steps to follow are outlined in the Zero Waste Masterplan and the Singapore Green Plan (SGP) 2030 [3,4]. The former blueprint highlights the need of new policies to adopt a circular economy model of waste and resource management practices, and to shift towards more sustainable production and consumption, with the aim of building a sustainable, resource-efficient, and climate-resilient nation [3]. The latter charts bold and concrete sectoral initiatives and targets to support efforts to attain net-zero carbon emissions, and implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement [4]. The SGP 2030 and Zero Waste Masterplan draw the path to develop a sustainable and circular economy tailored to Singapore’s unique geographic, economic, and social conditions [3,4]. Both blueprints propose a new way of doing business, producing goods, and providing services considering the well-being of the entire society. They consider the threats and constraints imposed by a changing climate and limited natural resources. They recognize the need of developing new capabilities to produce more with less, as well as of changing the citizens’ mindsets and behaviors to reduce consumption, enhance recycling and reuse, and take care for the environment, aiming to build a sustainable society. The government understands that in order to achieve a sustainable economy, the joint participation of citizens, industry, companies, academia, and authorities is required. That is why the public sector is taking the lead under GreenGov.SG, a sustainability movement launched to support the SGP 2030 [4,5]. Under this initiative, the public sector will strive to attain ambitious sustainability targets in carbon abatement and resource efficiency, and be a positive influence and enabler of green efforts. Singapore aspires to achieve net zero carbon emissions by mid-century, becoming a pioneer in technological and policy solutions for sustainable development, and playing a crucial role as a clean-tech hub and testbed for new green technologies. In many aspects, Singapore is a living laboratory, whose experiences could be valuable to other 112 Urban Resilience and Sustainability Volume 2, Issue 2, 110–150. cities, especially those in Southeast Asia and the tropics, throughout the world. Hence, Singapore recognizes the importance of working creatively to have a positive impact at home and beyond its shores. Singapore must develop innovative economic, social welfare, governance, and environmental strategies in collaboration with the entire Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Economic Community (AEC) to build a resilient region against the threats of climate change, environmental pollution, biodiversity loss, critical resource constraints, and current and future economic challenges. The positive outcomes of the SGP 2030 and Zero Waste Masterplan will depend on Singapore’s ability to extend its successful story of sustainable development and cooperation with its neighbors to achieve a regional circular economy. This article reviews the strategies and policies that Singapore has implemented to become a zero-waste and net zero carbon emissions nation based on a model of circular economy tailored to its unique conditions as a city-state. It also examines the progress made so far and the challenges encountered along the way. The review aims to provide insight into how Singapore’s institutional framework has contributed the country’s transformation into a resilient and resource-efficient nation seeking sustainable and inclusive economic growth. The article focuses on four sectors identified as the highest priority to accelerate environmental sustainability in the ASEAN region: waste management, food and agriculture, energy, and transportation [6]. Water, manufacturing, construction, financial markets, digital technology, and others are also relevant sectors and should be examined in future work. The article begins with a brief overview of Singapore’s economy and urbanization. The institutional organization and legal framework that Singapore has developed to achieve its environmental sustainability goals are then presented. The main core of the article is the analysis of the strategies and policies that Singapore has implemented to achieve a circular economy in the aforementioned priority sectors. The purpose of this article is to provide insight into how Singapore can bridge the gap between aspirations and reality. The regulatory policy framework, operational principles, enabling institutions, and citizen habits are all examined in order to identify the economic, political, and social factors that may hinder, or even nullify, the initiatives and mechanisms that allow for a smooth transition toward continuous sustainable development. The information examined is expected to provide insight for other cities, especially those in the tropics, contribute to the development of best practices and strategies, and foster international collaboration and partnerships to achieve a sustainable world based on a circular economy. 2. Population and urban development As of 2023, Singapore’s total population was almost 5.92 million, of which 4.15 million (70% of the total population) were citizens and permanent residents with a median age of 42 years [7]. Singapore’s 734 km2 of land area means a population density of 8062 people per km2. Singapore has transformed from a developing nation to a developed one in less than 60 years since gaining independence in 1965, due to smart, bold, and timely economic, industrial, and social policies, as well as promoting innovation and advances in technology [8]. Its per capita gross domestic product (GDP) increased from $428 in 1960 to $82,807 in 2022 (US dollars) [9]. This economic growth together with a dynamic governance have enabled Singapore to build a modern city, making the best use of its limited land space following an integrated master planning system [10]. This system embodies the key principles to make Singapore a livable and resilient city while maintaining a competitive economy, building a sustainable environment, and ensuring a high 113 Urban Resilience and Sustainability Volume 2, Issue 2, 110–150. quality of life for its citizens. As a city-state, Singapore must provide not only for housing, business, social, and recreational needs, but also for activities that are typically located outside a city, for instance, seaports and airports, water catchment areas, and utilities such as waste treatment plants and power stations. Singapore has considered all land-use demands comprehensively, and through a continuous land reclamation process has expanded its land by 25% since independence, while its built-up area has increased by a factor of four reaching over 420 km2, primarily at the expense of forest and farm areas. From its earliest days as an independent nation, Singapore has prioritized the construction of high-rise public housing to meet demands of a population that has tripled its size since then. Today, around 65% of the population lives in high-rise public housing developments like the ones shown in Figure S1, down from a high of 88% in 2000 [7]. In 2020, the Housing and Development Board (HDB) introduced the 10-year plan Green Towns Program to make HDB states more sustainable and livable. The program focuses on reducing energy consumption by harnessing solar energy to power common services (e.g., lifts, lights, and water pumps) and installing smart LED lighting in common areas. The program also proposes to recycle rainwater for the washing of common areas and watering plants, mitigating the risk of flooding, as well as intensify greenery and apply cool coatings on building facades, roofs, and pavement to reduce urban warming and improve thermal comfort for residents [11]. The goal is to reduce energy consumption in HDB towns by 15% from 2020’s levels by 2030. Some of the general industrial areas (e.g., electronics, manufacturing, etc.) are located within residential estates, but most of the heavy industries (e.g., oil refining, petrochemical, steelworks, etc.) are concentrated in a large industrial estate in the western part of the island that includes several reclaimed offshore islands. The commercial and business center is located in the southern part of Singapore and primarily consists of shopping malls, hotels, and entertainment complexes. The central business district, which houses the financial center and includes numerous tall skyscrapers, is located in the center of the southern part. Nine percent of Singapore’s land has been set aside for parks and natural reserves [12]. Over 25% of the urban landscape is covered by vegetation and over 80% of the road network is covered by green canopy [13,14]. Singapore’s moniker “City in a Garden” stems from the fact that greenery covers around half of its land area. 3. Institutional framework Singapore has implemented strong regulations to manage environmental pollution based on a Long-Term Plan using a pragmatic and cost-effective approach that considers environmental, economic, and social factors [12]. The Long-Term Plan guides Singapore’s development over the next 40–50 years. It ensures that there is sufficient land available to meet the needs of long-term population and economic growth, balanced with a good quality of life and a sense of well-being for everyone, while maintaining a clean and green environment (Figure 1). This plan is reviewed every 10–15 years to ensure that it remains relevant in meeting the needs and aspirations of current and future generations, taking into account evolving trends and the ever-changing global environment. It is translated to medium-term strategies through a Master Plan that is reviewed every five years. At the time of writing, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) was inviting the public to take part in conversations to draft a new Master Plan for 2025 that would consider four major themes: Shaping a Happy Healthy City, Enabling Sustainable Growth, Strengthening Urban Resilience, and Stewarding Our Nature and Heritage. 114 Urban Resilience and Sustainability Volume 2, Issue 2, 110–150. Figure 1.

The Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE), previously named the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR), has the task of ensuring a clean and sustainable environment, with resilient supplies of safe food and water. It formulates, reviews, and implements strategic policies to address key concerns on Singapore’s environment. The Ministry works alongside three statutory boards: the National Environment Agency (NEA), the National Water Agency (PUB), and the Food Agency (SFA). NEA implements MSE’s policies and develops and leads programs to improve and sustain a clean environment, promotes sustainability and resource efficiency, maintains high public health standards, provides timely and reliable meteorological information, and encourages a vibrant hawker culture. PUB is the national water agency, which manages Singapore’s water supply, water catchment, and used water in an integrated way. From April 2020, PUB also took on the responsibility of protecting Singapore’s coastline from sea-level rise. SFA oversees food safety and security, bringing together all functions related to food provision and resilience. The environmental agenda of Singapore has evolved from addressing issues such as pollution control, sewerage, drainage, and environmental health in the 1970s, to developing strategies to achieve sustainability and become a net zero carbon emissions nation, with major initiatives in carbon mitigation, coastal protection, zero waste, and a circular economy, as well as food and water security. Since independence, Singapore has pursued quality, inclusive, and sustainable growth. The Singapore Green Plan issued in 1992 was the country’s first formal plan to balance environmental and development needs. It outlined the policy directions Singapore would take to become a model green city by 2000 [15]. New environmental concerns on the city-island, such as transboundary air pollution and climate change, were included in a second plan launched in 2002 [16]. An extensive review was conducted in 2005, releasing a revised version in 2006, targeting the policy route for the next six years. The SGP 2012 moved towards attaining environmental sustainability from just being clean and green [17]. In 2009, it was replaced by the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint (SSB), a new framework to guide Singapore’s sustainable development efforts up to 2030 [18]. It set higher targets than those in the 115 Urban Resilience and Sustainability Volume 2, Issue 2, 110–150. SGP 2012 with the vision of making Singapore a livable and lively city by boosting resource efficiency, enhancing urban environments, building capabilities, and fostering community action. A review of the SSB was carried out in 2014, culminating in the release of the SSB 2015 [12]. The SSB 2015 outlined a national vision with new and bold plans to create a more livable and sustainable future for Singaporeans, which were aligned with international initiatives promoted by organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCCC). Singapore’s legislation includes the regulatory framework required to implement the policies outlined in those documents. In 1999, parliament passed the Environmental Pollution Control Act [19]. This act consolidated previous laws relating to air, water, and noise pollution control into a single act with the aim of providing a stronger legislative framework for the overall control of the environmental pollution from any industrial or trade premises. This act was revised in December 2002 to specify emission standards and testing methods. It was renamed as the Environmental Protection and Management Act (EPMA), and after 29 amendments, its regulations are still in place. On the global stage, Singapore has adopted the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals, as well as the Paris Agreement to address climate change [20,21]. Singapore has pledged to reduce its emission intensity by 36% below 2005 levels by 2030, stabilize its carbon emissions at 65 Mt CO2 eq, and halve its emissions from its peak to 33 Mt CO2 eq by 2050, with a view to achieving net zero carbon emissions as soon as viable in the second half of the century [22]. Moving towards a vision of a zero-waste nation, the inaugural Zero Waste Masterplan, launched in 2019, maps out Singapore’s strategies to embrace a circular economy approach to waste and resource management practices, and shifting toward more sustainable production and consumption [3]. While waste-to-energy (WTE) incineration technology allows for up to a 90% reduction in waste volume, Singapore’s only landfill, Semakau Landfill, will run out of space by 2035 at current waste disposal rates. In land-scarce Singapore, there is a pressing need to transition toward a circular economy in which resources are recovered from waste. This will reduce the carbon footprint of incineration and extend the lifespan of the Semakau Landfill. To catalyze this transition, the government introduced the landmark Resource Sustainability Act (RSA) to impose regulatory measures to address priority waste streams of electrical and electronic waste (e-waste), food waste, and packaging waste including plastics [23]. In February 2021, still in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the government launched the Singapore Green Plan 2030 to chart the country’s way toward a more sustainable future seeking a faster economic recovery, bringing new business and job opportunities in the context of a greener development. This new plan will continue to strengthen Singapore’s efforts in areas such as building a green city, investing in green energy, developing a green economy and green jobs, adapting to sea-level rise, improving food resilience, and enabling a green citizenry that consumes and wastes less [4]. The SGP 2030 is a multi-agency effort spearheaded by four ministries in addition to the MSE, including the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Trade and Industry, Ministry of Transport, and Ministry of National Development. It is important to point out that the government recognizes that, in addition to a robust legal framework and institutional structure, it is necessary to support the advancement of applied science in close partnership with industry and academia in order to find solutions toward the outlined circular economy model. That is why the MSE is committed to investing in research and development, and developing science and technology capabilities to address the complex challenges posed by climate change, environmental sustainability, water, and food security. Figure 2 shows a chart of the programs and policies that Singapore is currently implementing to achieve a circular economy for the four sectors 116 Urban Resilience and Sustainability Volume 2, Issue 2, 110–150. discussed in this article. The logos of the institutions involved in their application are also included. Readers will find in the Supplementary Material (SM) a table listing the blueprints and documents that describe such programs and policies, as well as a second table listing the laws and regulations enacted for that purpose. Photographs of Singapore’s infrastructure and lifestyle are also included in the SM to make the content easier to assimilate for both non-specialist and non-Singaporean readers. Figure 2. Singapore’s institutional framework to achieve a circular economy in the sectors of waste management, food and agriculture, energy, and transportation. The programs and policies implemented for such an endeavor are included, as well as the logos of the institutions in charge of their application. 4. Gap analysis methodology The following sections discuss Singapore’s policies, plans, and actions to build a circular economy. These sections focus on four sectors identified as priorities to accelerate sustainability in the ASEAN region: waste management, food and agriculture, energy, and transportation. The discussion is based on a gap analysis of the strategies implemented to become a resilient and resource-efficient nation seeking sustainable and inclusive economic growth. The objective is to identify the factors and institutional actions that have enabled the transition toward a circular economy, as well as the externalities and barriers that have acted in the opposite direction. The article examines the regulatory and institutional framework, operating principles, enabling institutions, and citizen habits in order to identify areas of opportunity for closing the gap between aspirations and reality. It looks into the convergence, consistency, and coordination of authorities and society, national policies, and local actions. The stakeholders’ engagement with the community and communication mechanisms are also examined, as are the transparency, commitment, and cooperation between both parties. Attention is also paid to regional and international commitments, as well as cooperation support. The aim is to provide a general assessment of the economic and social drivers, circumstances and innovations, and institutional feasibility of implementing a circular economy model in Singapore 117 Urban Resilience and Sustainability Volume 2, Issue 2, 110–150. considering its unique circumstances as an island city-state. By no means is the article seeking to rate the actions and progress on the matter. The author recognizes that there are no quantitative indicators to assess the effectiveness of policies and actions to reconcile economic growth with environmental concerns. As a result, the purpose of this article is only to provide scientific and technical insight to guide the actions that public and private sectors can take to help achieve a circular economy. All blueprints, programs, policies, and initiatives prepared and implemented by Singapore’s government agencies involved in building a circular economy model in the four selected sectors, as well as laws enacted by parliament in this regard, were thoroughly reviewed and analyzed. No official document accessible to the public was excluded. News and opinions about government strategies in the mainstream media were also reviewed. To support the discussion on the needs and challenges to implement such a model, selected peer-reviewed literature on the topic was used. Only relevant references were included to highlight key gaps and challenges to address with future research. The material presented here was complemented with observations and comments from representatives assigned by the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, and the Singapore Food Agency. The draft was also shared with the other government agencies involved, but they did not respond. A narrative structure is used to introduce and discuss the strategies designed and implemented to achieve a circular economy, which closely follows the five-information-level framework proposed by Iacovidou et al. [24]. This is a framework based on five interconnected components that must be considered to support transitions to circular economy, namely, natural environment and provisioning services; governance, regulatory framework, and political landscape; technology, infrastructure, and innovation; business activities and the market; and human patterns and societal needs. This holistic approach simplifies systemic complexity by examining the relationships between processes, values, and actors in the value chain, and their dependence on cultural, spatial, and temporal characteristics. 5. Waste management Singapore has an efficient waste management collection system that protects public health, and the amount of waste that ends up littering the environment is low. General waste is collected daily, and recyclable items three times per week by public or private waste collectors. Citizens are responsible for disposing of general and recycling waste in separate bins. To reduce the volume of waste that goes to the only active landfill, as much as feasible is incinerated. Through incineration, waste volume is reduced up to 90% and excess heat from waste-to-energy incineration plants provides about 2% of Singapore’s electricity supply. However, it is not sufficient to pursue a circular economy model as stated in the Zero Waste Masterplan [3]. Current policies are based on reducing and recycling waste as much as possible. Although they have been effective in reducing overall waste generation, they must be adjusted to speed up the process. Singapore has set ambitious targets to increase overall recycling rates to 70% and reduce daily waste-to-landfill per capita by 30% by 2030 in order to extend Semakau Landfill’s lifespan beyond 2035 [3]. Under the SGP 2030, this goal will be prioritized to achieve a 20% reduction in waste-to-landfill per capita by 2026. In 2022, 7.39 million tonnes of solid waste were generated, with the domestic and non-domestic sectors accounting for 25% and 75%, respectively [25]. Total waste amounted to 7.81 million tonnes in 2016, and consistently decreased until 2022, when it increased 6% over the previous year. To achieve the targets mentioned above, the waste increase in 2022 must be reversed and the 118 Urban Resilience and Sustainability Volume 2, Issue 2, 110–150. decreasing trend observed in previous years accelerated in concert with circularity-promoting initiatives to close as many resource loops as possible. Since 2016, overall recycling rates of 55–60% have been achieved by focusing on individual waste streams. As seen in Figure 3, construction and demolition waste as well as ferrous and nonferrous metals are nearly all recycled. However, the recycling of plastic, textiles, and leather has not exceeded 10% [25]. The recycling rate of paper and cardboard has decreased in recent years, reaching 37% in 2022. Similarly, recycling rates of waste food and glass also show no significant progress. In 2022, they did not reach 20%. Figure 3. Recycling rates by type of waste reported by the National Environmental Agency [25]. The figures on the right indicate the amount of generated waste in 2022 in thousands of tonnes. The category of Others includes stones, ceramics, and other materials. Singapore has decided on an integrated waste management system to sort recyclable material at waste-to-energy facilities. Residents of public high-rise apartments and private landed housing estates have easy access to commingled recycling bins for paper, plastic, metal, and glass waste (Figure S2). Although these bins specify which items can and cannot be recycled, approximately 40% of the items deposited are not suitable for recycling [26]. In the end, around 87% of Singapore’s domestic waste is incinerated, with the resulting ash and other non-incinerable waste ending up at Semakau Landfill. Singapore is a party to the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, hence exporting incineration ash is not possible [27]. As a result, stronger legislation and improved recycling standards are required to transition to a circular economy. Improved waste management in households and commercial facilities can promote a domestic market for recycled materials. Authorities and organizations are implementing campaigns to reduce the demand for single-use items and recycle used plastic, but it is unclear how effective these initiatives will be in the long run. 119 Urban Resilience and Sustainability Volume 2, Issue 2, 110–150. From 2021, firms are required to report the amount of material used to pack their products, and submit plans to reduce, reuse, and recycle (3R) packing waste [25]. Companies that supply regulated goods, such as manufacturers and importers of packaged products, as well as retailers such as supermarkets, are required to report data on the packaging that they introduce into Singapore on an annual basis under the Mandatory Packaging Reporting (MPR) scheme. To begin, the MPR requirements apply to companies with an annual revenue of more than SG$7.25 million. The MPR lays the foundation for an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) framework for managing packaging waste. Singapore has imposed a minimum charge of five cents per disposable carrier bag at larger supermarkets since 2023 to reduce their use. Similarly, as the first phase of the EPR framework for packaging waste, a Beverage Container Return scheme will be implemented in the following years. A new Integrated Waste Management Facility (Tuas Nexus IWMF) is being built. When completed in 2025, it is expected to meet Singapore’s long-term solid waste management needs [28]. It will be able to incinerate 5,800 tonnes of incinerable waste per day, sort 250 tonnes of household recyclables per day using automated equipment, and treat and co-digest 400 tonnes of food waste with 800 tonnes per day of dewatered sludge from a nearby water reclamation plant (WRP). The co-location of two facilities, the IWMF and WRP, will optimize land use and improve energy and resource recovery from solid waste and used water. 5.1. Plastic waste Plastic waste is most likely Singapore’s most difficult waste management challenge. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles, Styrofoam containers, and plastic bags are the most common sources of plastic waste, accounting for roughly one-third of all domestic waste [29]. A survey found that each resident uses 3–4 disposable plastic items per day, adding up to about 1.8 billion nationally each year [30]. There is a lack of awareness about what can be recycled, highlighting the importance of campaigns to educate on the importance of reducing single-use items. Creative campaigns that encourage the public to reduce the use of disposables, cultivate good recycling practices, and guide them on what can and cannot be recycled are welcome (e.g., “Say YES to Waste Less” and “Recycle Right”, https://www.cgs.gov.sg/). New regulations should focus on reducing plastic use and requiring plastic packaging and products to be redesigned so that they retain their value and are more recyclable in local and regional markets. Bans on certain types of plastics and products made from composite materials (composed of more than one type of material that is not physically separable) should also be considered. It does not appear feasible that Singapore will be able to stop its massive use of plastic in the near future, even by implementing best recycling practices, and thus will need to find a solution to manage plastic waste disposal. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic increased Singaporeans’ reliance on food delivery services, leading to an increase in plastic waste. Before the pandemic, more than half of Singaporeans admitted to ordering food delivery at least once a week. According to food delivery companies and online surveys, there was a 70–80% increase during the two-month COVID-19 lockdown, resulting in an additional 1334 tonnes of disposable plastic waste [31–33]. These surveys also found that people today are more willing to use food delivery and take-out services. Therefore, it is critical to develop strategies to encourage customers to reduce single-use plastic packaging by using and bringing their own food containers. Based on the available technology, it is necessary to determine whether incineration is the best 120 Urban Resilience and Sustainability Volume 2, Issue 2, 110–150. solution when all environmental and social costs associated with waste management are considered [34]. The cost of improving management operations, developing efficient domestic and regional recycling industries, and designing safe disposal methods must be considered when determining the best strategies to mitigate environmental and social impacts, as well as public health risks associated with an economy based on cheap plastic. Investments must be calculated and evaluated in light of the evident and hidden costs of continuing to use plastic in an indiscriminate manner in the present and future. Policymakers must keep in mind that over 4000 chemical compounds found in plastics are hazardous, some of these compounds are known to leach into food, water, and the environment, posing risks to human and ecosystem health [35]. In light of this, Singapore could explore policies that tax plastic consumption, as well as taxes based on product sales to cover the costs of disposal or recycling. An accurate estimate of the domestic cost of using plastic would assist authorities in determining the benefit of enacting taxation schemes. 5.2. Textile waste Textile waste also represents a major challenge. According to the NEA, Singapore generated over 254,000 tonnes of textile waste in 2022, with only 2% being recycled (down from 4% in 2021). Used textiles go to incinerators, in part because there are relatively few facilities for people to recycle. Indeed, recycling textiles, from fiber to fiber, can only happen with 100% cotton and in large volumes. Synthetic materials and mixed materials are harder to recycle. Textile recycling requires the manual separation of fibers, as well as buttons and zips. Different fibers are not easy to identify by eye, and overall, such manual processes are time-consuming and not a profitable business [36]. However, social enterprises and clothing-swap movements have emerged in recent years, contributing to the solution by collecting fashion textiles and apparels for reuse, upcycling, and recycling (e.g., Cloop, https://cloop.sg/; SG Recycle, https://www.sgrecycle.com/; and The Fashion Pulpit, https://www.thefashionpulpit.com/). Recycling bins can be found in community centers and wet markets where people can drop off their unwanted clothes (Figure S3). The success of these initiatives will depend on whether they can be scaled up and on people’s behavior. It is important to encourage people to buy less, choose well, and make their clothes last, challenging the trend of fast fashion (i.e., cheap, trendy clothing that samples ideas from the catwalk and turns them into garments at breakneck speed to meet consumer demand). 5.3. Food waste Every week, each household discards 2.5 kg of avoidable food waste [3]. Over the last decade, the amount of food waste generated has increased by about 20%. Food waste accounted for 44% of total domestic waste disposed of in 2022, but only 18% of food waste was recycled [25]. To reduce food waste, consumers must practice smart food purchasing, storage, and preparation habits. The NEA guidebooks for reducing food waste in retail food establishments, supermarkets, and food manufacturing establishments, as well as consumer guidelines, are promising steps to avoid food waste from the start [37–40]. Similarly, pilot projects to test the feasibility of using on-site systems to treat food waste at hawker centers and markets, as well as the partnership of authorities and the private sector to segregate food waste in large commercial and industrial buildings have yielded positive results [41]. Premises that generate large amounts of food waste, such as hotels, malls, supermarkets, 121 Urban Resilience and Sustainability Volume 2, Issue 2, 110–150. food manufacturers, food caterers, schools, and hospitals, will gradually be required to segregate their food waste for treatment over the course of 2024 and 2025. 6. Food and agriculture Singapore imports more than 90% of its food from about 180 countries [42]. Table 1 lists the major sources of supply for the most commonly consumed food items, as well as the associated per capita consumption and import volumes. An environmental impact study that took into account where Singapore’s food comes from and a per capita consumption of 367 kg (46% fruits and vegetables, 25% grains, 29% meats, eggs, and seafood) without accounting for sugar and cooking oil, but accounting for food waste, determined an associated carbon footprint in terms of a carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2 eq) of 954 kg per capita in 2018 [43]. This figure is consistent with the 5.39 Gg CO2 eq at the country level (i.e., 960 kg CO2 eq per capita) estimated based on the food-miles concept, which considers the distance traveled by food products from the points of production to the points of consumption [44]. In both cases, the carbon footprint associated with food consumption is equivalent to about 10% of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reported in the official emissions inventory on a per capita basis (9.8 tons CO2 eq) [45]. However, when considering the carbon emissions associated with the production of all goods consumed by an average dweller, no matter if the emissions occurred outside Singapore, the carbon footprint associated with food consumption is equivalent to about 3.5% of the carbon footprint of every person, 27.7 tons CO2 eq [46]. The results of that study accounted for GHG emissions from production, processing, and transportation stages, but not from retail distribution and consumption stages [43]. Emissions from all material and resource inputs, waste, food loss, and by-products were taken into account. Thus, it was found that food production and processing were responsible for more than 80% of GHG emissions. Red meats (pork, mutton, and beef) had the greatest environmental impact. Despite accounting for about 7% of the annual food consumption by weight, they contributed 40% of GHG emissions. This is due to the fact that they are mostly transported by air. Therefore, frozen meat should take precedence over chilled meat. However, if chilled or fresh meat is preferred, it must come from a country close to Singapore. In contrast, fruits and vegetables accounted for 46% of the annual food consumption and contributed less than 11% of GHG emissions. The study also found that adopting an optimal health diet of 50% fruits and vegetables, 25% grains, and 25% meats, eggs, and seafood could reduce GHG emissions per capita by around 16%. To reduce GHG emissions from transportation, the vast majority of food should be sourced within the ASEAN Economic Community, and produced locally as much as possible. Food should be transported by land or sea and come from sources with sustainable production and processing chains. Singapore could take advantage of its status as a major commercial hub for ASEAN by acting as a regional distributor of regional food items. 122 Urban Resilience and Sustainability Volume 2, Issue 2, 110–150. Table 1. Per capita consumption, import volumes, and three major sources of supply for Singapore’s most commonly consumed food items.

Local farming The SGP 2030 aims to meet 30% of Singapore’s nutritional needs through local production by 2030 in order to ensure a more resilient food supply [4]. This will necessitate increasing the capability and capacity of the local agri-food industry. However, only local production of fish, shrimp, hen eggs, and leafy vegetables can be realistically scaled up. About one percent of Singapore’s land area is available for farming purposes. Urban farming is an option, but meeting such an ambitious target will be difficult, not to mention the large carbon footprint it entails. Depending on the crop and site, urban farming can emit up to six times as much carbon as conventional agriculture [51]. Fish, bivalves, and shrimp production, on the other hand, may have greater potential through an improved aquaculture industry [52], and their consumption would help reduce the country’s carbon footprint. Replacing meat with some types of sustainably sourced seafood can help reduce carbon emissions without compromising nutrition. Farmed bivalves and shellfish, such as mussels and clams, and small surface-dwelling (pelagic) fish, which include anchovies and mackerel, generate less GHG emissions and are more nutrient dense than beef, pork, and chicken [53]. During the last two years, the government has set aside over US$120 million to encourage research and development in sustainable urban food production. Some initial testbed projects have included commercial rooftop farming and placing farms in underutilized spaces. The Food Agency has supported innovative projects such as the Sky Green’s 9-meter-tall system that allows vegetables to grow vertically outdoors (https://www.skygreens.com/), as well as Sustenir Agriculture’s indoor controlled environment agriculture farm that enables control of all aspects of the environment to optimize crop growth (https://sustenir.com/). The SFA’s website “From SG to SG” showcases other examples of local farms that are tapping into technology and employing sustainable practices to increase production and improve product quality (https://www.sfa.gov.sg/fromSGtoSG/). 123 Urban Resilience and Sustainability Volume 2, Issue 2, 110–150. Initiatives to optimize land space for agriculture includes the master planning of a high-tech agri-food zone in the district of Lim Chu Kang, which is already occupied by farms. The objective is to raise the production in a sustainable and resource-efficient manner in existing plots by developing infrastructure to support productive farming, and establishing shared facilities such as waste treatment plants or packing facilities to achieve economies of scale (https://www.ourfoodfuture.gov.sg/). The Food Agency is also studying the expansion of sustainable fish farming in the deeper southern waters to boost local fish production. There are also plans to unlock the potential of sea-based fish farming through more productive, sustainable, and climate-resilient management methods and practices [54]. Another significant initiative is the Sungei Kadut Eco-Agri-Food District’s Innovation Park. By bringing together high-tech urban farming in both agriculture and aquaculture, as well as associated research and development activities, this industrial park will serve as a pilot cluster to spur innovation in the agri-food tech ecosystem (https://estates.jtc.gov.sg/sked/). The National Parks Board (NParks) is inviting enthusiastic citizens to grow their own edible vegetables in small plots set up in parks as part of the SGP 2030. At the time of writing, over 2400 allotment plots were available in 28 parks across the island (Figure S4). According to the Edible Horticulture Masterplan, there are plans to include allotment gardens in residential states, as well [55]. The initiative has received a positive response, is a fun and rewarding activity, and helps to embed the concept of a circular economy within the community. However, the food production from these community gardens is limited and does not count towards official production figures and targets. 6.2. Preference to local products Shifting consumer preferences in favor of a more sustainable diet based on food items of local and regional origin will help to build a circular model while also boosting regional economies and avoiding carbon emissions associated with transportation. Origin of production labelling paired with nutritional information could be an effective strategy for empowering consumers with information to choose a healthy and environmentally friendly option [56]. Singapore already has labelling schemes for healthy packed foods and locally produced fresh foods (Figure 4), which could be modified to include food products from the ASEAN region that are produced in a sustainable and resource-efficient manner. Companies are encouraged to produce healthy food products and become eligible for the Healthier Choice Symbol, which is a voluntary labelling scheme that allows them to inform about the healthy ingredients in their products and reach more consumers. Today, this label has been granted to about 4000 different food products [57]. Similarly, the SG Fresh Produce badges are granted to locally produced fresh products such as fish, eggs, leafy vegetables, mushrooms, and more (https://www.sfa.gov.sg/fromSGtoSG). There are three tiers to these badges. The 1-star badge is granted to locally grown fresh produce from SFA-licensed farms. The 2-star badge applies to fresh produce from local farms certified to the Good Agriculture Practice (GAP) standard. While the 3-star badge is for local produce that is not only fresh and high-quality, but also clean and green certified. It means that the produce is grown in GAP-certified local farms that additionally employ sustainable and resource-efficient practices, with minimal waste generation. The government could form alliances with retailers, encouraging them to prioritize locally or regionally produced food on their shelves, and even offer discounts and promotions through subsidies and tax breaks. 124 Urban Resilience and Sustainability Volume 2, Issue 2, 110–150. Figure 4. Labelling schemes for healthy packed foods and locally produced fresh foods (Healthier Choice Symbol and SG Fresh Produce, Singapore Food Agency). 7. Energy Singapore’s successful transformation into a developed nation has been supported by an energy policy framework that is flexible enough to deal with the ever-evolving global energy landscape [58]. This framework has evolved from viewing energy as a commodity required for economic growth to the need to ensure supply security, which has resulted in the diversification of fuel sources and suppliers, and, more recently, as a matter of national security due to the threats posed by climate change. Carbon dioxide is the most significant GHG emitted in Singapore, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas to meet energy demands in industry, buildings, households, and transportation. Given Singapore’s limited potential for alternative energy sources such as solar and wind power, improving energy efficiency has been the primary strategy to reduce carbon emissions in all sectors of the economy. In the face of an expanding economy and a growing population, Singapore’s efforts are focused on using energy more efficiently rather than increasing energy production. The National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS, https://www.nccs.gov.sg/) coordinates the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change, and spearheads the actions to promote energy efficiency through legislation, incentives, and public education with support of the NEA, EMA, Building Construction Authority (BCA), and Land Transport Authority (LTA). The main mechanisms used to improve energy efficiency are pricing, energy conservation, efficiency in energy production, diversification of fuel supplies, and the development of alternative energy sources. The energy price is determined by market forces to ensure that it is used efficiently, and electricity and gas tariffs are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that they reflect total costs. Energy conservation is achieved through infrastructure and distribution system improvements, the development of energy-optimized industrial clusters, financial incentives, energy efficiency regulations for buildings, households, and industries, and support for clean transportation technologies. Energy efficiency is achieved through market competition in the generation and sale of electricity. Diversification of energy supplies has been achieved by allowing new energy alternatives to enter the market, developing renewable energy sources, investing in energy research and development, and increasing natural gas imports from countries other than Malaysia and Indonesia through the construction of liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities. Singapore aims to become a major LNG trading hub by promoting cooperation and integration throughout the ASEAN region. 125 Urban Resilience and Sustainability Volume 2, Issue 2, 110–150. These policies have been effective in reducing energy intensity, which implies improved energy efficiency. However, as shown in Figure 5, they have not reduced net carbon emissions or moderated energy consumption. Energy consumption has increased about 14-folds over the last 50 years, although its growth has slowed since 2005. Energy intensity has decreased by about a third since then, while CO2 emissions have remained relatively constant. Energy intensity has declined as a result of decreased reliance on fossil fuels as a percentage of the GDP, the introduction of cleaner technologies, a relative decline in manufacturing’s share of the GDP relative to that of less energy-intensive services as income rises, and conservation practices. However, the biggest improvement came when oil was replaced by natural gas for electricity generation two decades ago. Natural gas, which has lower carbon content per unit of electricity generated, now accounts for more than 95% of Singapore’s fuel mix for electricity generation [59]. Figure 5. Singapore’s historical energy consumption and intensity, and the associated CO2 emissions. (a) Total energy consumption by source in mega-tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe). (b) GDP (billion SG$), energy intensity (Mtoe/million SG$), energy efficiency index, and energy consumption relative to 2005. The GDP is at market prices of 2021 as reported by the Department of Statistics Singapore (https://www.singstat.gov.sg/). (c) CO2 emissions from fuel combustion. (d) Electricity generation by type of source. (e) Oil and oil products consumption by type of fuel. Energy and CO2 emissions data were obtained from the International Energy Agency (IEA) World Energy Balances 2019 (https://www.iea.org). The energy intensity was computed as the amount of energy consumed in Mtoe per million SG$ of GDP. The energy efficiency index includes energy used for electricity generation as calculated by Su et al. [60]. 126 Urban Resilience and Sustainability Volume 2, Issue 2, 110–150. Although all economic sectors have had some success in improving energy efficiency and conservation, the changes have not been homogeneous. Through a decomposition analysis, Su et al. found that industries have improved energy efficiency by 18% since 2005 while increasing energy consumption by 27% [60]. Similarly, the commercial sector has improved energy efficiency by 30%, but increased energy consumption by 52%. In the transportation sector, energy efficiency improvements and changes in demand structure have resulted in reductions of 23% and 14% in energy consumption for passenger and freight transportation, respectively, despite increases in demand. In the residential sector, a shift toward larger housing and the acquisition of new types of household appliances (e.g., clothes dryers, vacuum cleaners, and massage chairs) have prevented a net reduction in energy consumption [61]. Finally, structural changes in the power generation sector have brought the largest reductions in energy consumption, mostly due to the previously mentioned shift from oil to natural gas for power generation. The net effect of improving energy efficiency in all economic sectors has not reduced the total energy consumption; nevertheless, it has increased only by half of what it would have increased without energy efficiency improvements. To quantify how effective changes in energy efficiency have been in total energy consumption without considering other economic and social factors, Su et al. constructed a composite index of energy efficiency that shows a slower rate of improvement when compared to that given by the reduction in Singapore’s energy intensity since 2005 (Figure 5b). The gap between these two indicators shows the effects of structural changes in the economy, as well as differences in the growth of activity and demand for service in comparison to the GDP [62]. 7.1. Power generation The combustion of fossil fuels is Singapore’s primary source of GHG emissions. According to the latest national emissions inventory of GHG based on 2018 data, fossil fuel combustion accounts for 91% of the total emissions (53,313 Gg CO2 eq [63]). This figure is consistent with that provided by the International Energy Agency, as shown in Figure 5c. Electricity generation accounts for 38% of all emissions. The industrial sector contributes another 38%, with land transport accounting for around 15%. With limited access to alternative energy sources, natural gas will remain Singapore’s principal energy source for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, the SGP 2030 states that low-carbon energy sources must start topping on energy needs across all economy sectors. For such an endeavor, the EMA launched the Four Switches plan to drive Singapore’s energy supply transformation toward sustainability [64]. The first switch is to scale up the use of available renewable energy sources. The second switch aims to build regional power grids to increase low-carbon electricity. The third switch involves exploring emerging low-carbon alternatives such as hydrogen, as well as carbon capture and utilization. Through the fourth switch, the government will continue to work with companies to promote the adoption of more efficient power generation technologies. 7.1.1. Solar energy Solar energy remains Singapore’s most promising renewable energy source, while improved energy storage systems should mitigate its intermittent nature. Solar photovoltaic systems are being installed on rooftops as well as offshore spaces, reservoirs, walkways, and vacant lots. Today, 127 Urban Resilience and Sustainability Volume 2, Issue 2, 110–150. Singapore is one of the most solar-dense cities in the world. For the first half of 2023, the total solar energy capacity installed was 1006 MWp (power output under optimal conditions) [59]. It should reach 1.5 and 2 GWp by 2025 and 2030, respectively. This would be enough to meet around 2% and 3% of the projected electricity demand, and generate enough electricity to power 260,000 and 350,000 households a year, respectively. This is a commendable effort, but it covers only a small fraction of the country’s total electricity demand (Figure 5d). Furthermore, solar power is subject to weather conditions. Frequent cloudiness, high temperature, and high humidity reduce the efficiency of photovoltaic cells, limiting Singapore’s ability to host a significant solar energy capacity [65,66]. Here, energy storage becomes critical. Current plans aim to increase the energy storage capacity to 200 MW, allowing it to power over 16,000 households per day beyond 2025. This amount of energy, however, will not make the solar energy system self-sufficient, necessitating the use of natural gas as a backup power source. Other two important constraints for an effective transition to solar energy in Singapore are a lack of space to build large solar arrays and the short- and long-term environmental impacts of installing photovoltaic panels. According to the roadmap for solar photovoltaic energy in Singapore, only 36.8 km2 across the island can be used to deploy solar photovoltaic arrays [67]. Of this, 62% would be on buildings, including roofs and facades. The balance would be shared between temporary land-based installations (temporary because the land is zoned for another use), floating installations on reservoirs and unused near-shore sea areas, and panels installed above land, canals, and roads. The costs would vary depending on the option, and none are cheap when compared to installing arrays on large tracts of unused open land. The photovoltaic industry is still young in Singapore, and has not yet experienced problems in managing the waste generated by photovoltaic panels that have reached their useful life (20–25 years). However, an initial estimate suggested that up to 5,000 tonnes of photovoltaic waste could be roughly generated between 2022 and 2024, with the possibility of increasing exponentially in a few years’ time [68]. Under the NEA Resource Sustainability Act, companies that import and sell solar panels must provide free take-back services for their customers when the panels reach the end of their useful life. Solar panels are made of potentially recyclable materials, such as aluminum, glass, and silicon, but their separation is costly. In addition, Singapore’s photovoltaic waste is small when compared to other countries. Therefore, it might be more cost-effective to have large-scale regional recycling centers to collect photovoltaic waste from all ASEAN countries. However, a comprehensive life cycle analysis to evaluate the environmental impact of photovoltaic panels on a large scale in the local and regional contexts is missing. Initial assessments at the building scale suggest positive benefits [69–71]. Similarly, no rigorous study has evaluated the impact on the local climate of changing the albedo of the urban surface by installing solar panels, nor the long-term ecological impacts of floating solar farms on aquatic ecosystems. The deployment of floating solar panels, “floatovoltaics” in short, on reservoirs and sea waters holds much promise in Singapore, and there has been a rapid rise in installation, even though there are still unknowns about potential environmental impacts, along with social, technical, and economic aspects [72]. Initial assessments conducted by PUB suggest minimal impacts on water quality and biodiversity with appropriate planning and design. Floatovoltaics have proven to perform 5–15% better than typical rooftop solar arrays due to the cooler temperature of the reservoir environment [73]. A 45-hectare floating solar farm was recently put into operation, producing 60 MWp and making it one of the world’s largest inland floating solar systems (Figure S5) [74]. 128 Urban Resilience and Sustainability Volume 2, Issue 2, 110–150. 7.1.2. Importing clean energy An alternative to increase the share of renewable energy is to import electricity from other countries. Such imports could include electricity (via cable connections) generated by wind power, bioenergy, hydropower, geothermal, and even nuclear energy. Singapore is currently exploring ways to leverage bilateral and regional cooperation to tap on regional power grids for renewable sources. These include small-scale trials to import 100 MW (1.5% of peak demand) of electricity from Malaysia, and another 100 MW through a joint commitment with Lao PDR, Thailand, and Malaysia to integrate a cross-border network under the ASEAN Power Grid program [75]. As of the end of 2023, EMA had issued conditional approvals to import 1, 2, and 1.3 GW from Cambodia, Indonesia, and Vietnam, respectively, with the intention of importing at least 4 GW by 2035, accounting for roughly 30% of its electricity demand [76]. Cross-border power integration would improve electricity security, affordability, and sustainability in Southeast Asia. However, there are a number of technical and institutional challenges to overcome, such as the harmonization of energy grids, the development of regulatory frameworks in line with domestic utility boards, and the willingness of countries to sell surplus energy while avoiding sovereignty interferences [77]. This will require a cooperative culture in which governments exchange information and align policies aiming to build fair and honest institutional trade capacities that benefit everyone. Strict transboundary environmental governance will be needed to prevent social and environmental risks to communities and ecosystems that provide the energy resources [78,79]. The hydropower development along the Mekong River basin is an example of how the environmental and social impacts have outweighed the benefits of a regional source of renewable energy. The construction of dams has degraded the river basin’s sustainability, threatened biodiversity, and endangered millions of people’s livelihood. The existing dams have had a significant impact on the seasonal patterns of the Mekong River flow and associated flood pulses, affecting agricultural production and fishery yield. Communities have been displaced and denied access to lands, forests, and rivers crucial to their livelihoods [80–83]. Singapore will need to ensure that the dams used to generate the electricity it will import have undergone comprehensive environmental and social assessments that take into account cumulative impacts on communities and the ecosystem. 7.1.3. Emerging low-carbon alternatives Singapore is currently studying emerging technologies, such as low-carbon hydrogen and carbon capture, utilization, and storage, as alternatives to decarbonize the power sector [76]. Hydrogen is considered a clean fuel as it does not produce CO2 when burned, but only if it is produced from renewable resources or extracted from geologic sources. Most hydrogen today is produced from natural gas; a cleaner option is splitting water with electrolysers, but it is approximately 2.5 times as expensive [84]. Green technologies to store and generate hydrogen are still nascent and expensive, but they have been considered as an alternative to achieve net zero carbon emissions in the medium to long term, as costs come down as more plants are built [85,86]. Similarly, processes are still being developed to capture CO2 produced from emission sources such as power plants and refineries, convert it into usable products (e.g., construction materials, chemicals, and synthetic fuels), or transport and deposit it in storage sites to prevent it from entering the atmosphere [87,88]. One major issue with the latter is that the CO2 stream’s purity must exceed 95% in order to reduce the costs of compression and storage. 129 Urban Resilience and Sustainability Volume 2, Issue 2, 110–150. It is unclear when and where low-carbon hydrogen will be produced at economies of scale, or how it will be transported to Singapore in a secure and cost-effective way. Similarly, while there are still questions about whether the extraction of natural hydrogen, a potential non-fossil renewable fuel, will be commercially viable in the near future [89], Singapore has recognized that low-carbon hydrogen can be a major decarbonization pathway to meet its net zero carbon emission commitments by 2050. So, it is already working with international partners to incentivize the exploration of geological hydrogen wells and accelerate the development of hydrogen supply chains, while developing local capabilities and infrastructure to be ready to integrate hydrogen when it becomes commercially available [90]. Geothermal, biomethane, nuclear fission, and nuclear fusion technologies are all expected to be low-carbon supply alternatives in the future. As with hydrogen, Singapore should collaborate with industry and research partners to develop these technologies and build capabilities to adapt them as soon as they prove suitable in the local context. Future generations of small fission modular reactors and advances in nuclear fusion technology hold promise for unlocking low-carbon and low-radiation energy, allowing to cover up to 10% of the country’s needs through nuclear energy by 2050, as recently determined by a study commissioned by Singapore’s government [76]. Small modular reactors (with a total capacity of up to 300 MW) show particular promise. They offer flexibility in plant design and maintenance, making them suitable for use alongside other clean alternatives. Fast neutron reactors operate with enough energy to cause the fission of many heavy atoms, potentially eliminating both nuclear waste and reliance on uranium as the only fuel source [91]. 7.2. Industrial energy efficiency The Energy Conservation Act went into effect in 2013 with the target of increasing energy conservation for large energy users (companies that consume over 54 TJ or more of energy per year) through regular energy monitoring and reporting, as well as the implementation of structured energy management systems [92]. Originally, the objectives were to improve companies’ energy performance to make them more competitive in the global economy, to complement existing schemes that help them invest in energy efficiency, and to ensure a coordinated approach to setting energy efficiency standards across all industries. In 2017, the Act was amended to include more energy management practices as part of Singapore’s efforts to meet its pledge under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change to increase energy intensity by 36% from 2005 levels by 2030 by achieving energy efficiency improvement rates of 1–2% per year, similar to those achieved by leading developed countries. The amendments include strengthening GHG emission measurements and reporting requirements, requiring companies to develop energy efficiency improvement plans, conducting periodic energy efficiency opportunity assessments, and establishing minimum energy efficiency standards for common industrial equipment and systems. To phase out inefficient common industrial equipment and systems, Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) for induction motors and Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards (MEES) for water-cooled chilled systems were recently introduced [93]. The government also works to create a cleaner industrial ecosystem by providing co-funding support and voluntary partnership programs for companies. The Energy Efficiency Fund (E2F) supports companies in the industrial sector to be more energy efficient [93]. Companies can receive co-funding support for projects such as the resource efficient design of new facilities or major 130 Urban Resilience and Sustainability Volume 2, Issue 2, 110–150. expansions, carry out energy assessments for their existing facilities to identify potential areas for energy efficiency improvement, adopt energy efficient equipment or technologies, switch to water-cooled chillers using refrigerants with low global warming potential, and implement energy management information systems to effectively manage energy use in a structured manner. 7.2.1. Carbon tax Singapore became the first Southeast Asian country to levy a carbon tax in 2019. The initial carbon tax rate was set at SG$5 per tonne CO2 eq, by 2024 and 2026 it will raise to SG$25 and SG$45 per tonne CO2 eq, respectively, with the aim of reaching SG$50–80 per tonne CO2 eq by 2030. The goal is to provide a strong price signal and incentive for industries to reduce their carbon footprint in line with national climate objectives. The carbon tax currently applies on facilities emitting 25,000 tonne CO2 eq or more annually, and it covers all large emitters such as oil refineries and power generation plants, which contribute to 80% of the national GHG emissions [94]. The revenue will be used to support decarbonization efforts and the transition to a green economy, as well as to mitigate the impact on low-income households. On average, households will see a SG$4 increase in their monthly utilities bill, which should have a minor impact on most of them. However, the carbon tax will have an impact on downstream industries and businesses (e.g., transportation, retailers, workshops, restaurants, etc.), which may end up passing the additional cost to consumers, ultimately affecting households’ expenditure. Therefore, the government must ensure that the carbon tax does not cause an excessive increase in the cost of living while also maintaining the competitiveness of local companies. 7.3. Energy efficiency in buildings The Building Construction Authority’s Green Mark Scheme is the backbone of Singapore’s strategies to increase energy efficiency in buildings [95]. It is a rating system designed specifically for the tropics to evaluate and set benchmarks for environmental sustainability in buildings. The Green Mark Scheme is part of Singapore’s Green Building Masterplan [96], and it seeks to encourage developers and owners to construct and maintain greener buildings. The design of a building has direct impact on energy efficiency. Existing buildings can be retrofitted with green designs to improve their energy efficiency. Table 2 lists the main programs and incentive schemes implemented by the BCA to support these strategies. The Green Mark Scheme consists of a set of standards that developers and owners must meet to achieve a 28% improvement in energy efficiency over 2005 building codes. These standards, which apply to both new and existing buildings undergoing major retrofitting works (with a gross floor area of 2000 m2 or more), help buildings achieve energy savings ranging from 20% to 40% over their lifetimes. The scheme is aligned with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, emphasizing designing for maintainability, reducing embodied carbon throughout the buildings’ life cycle using smart technologies, enhancing buildings’ resilience to climate change, and creating healthier environments for building users. The 80-80-80 plan was launched as part of Singapore’s Green Plan 2030 to speed up the transition to a low-carbon built environment, with a focus on three targets. The first target is to have at least 80% of buildings (by floor area) green by 2030. By the end of 2022, 55% of Singapore’s buildings had been greened. The second target is for 80% of new developments (by floor area) to be classified as Super 131 Urban Resilience and Sustainability Volume 2, Issue 2, 110–150. Low Energy Buildings by 2030. These buildings must improve their energy efficiency by at least 60% over 2005 building codes. While the third target seeks to increase energy efficiency from 65% to 80% (over 2005 levels) for best-in-class green buildings by 2030. Table 2. Schemes and programs developed to encourage the implementation of innovative solutions to improve energy efficiency in Singapore’s buildings as part of the 80-80-80 plan in 2030. Scheme/Program Description Green Mark Scheme 2021 [95] Provides a robust and leading method for assessing and verifying buildings’ environmental performance, assisting designers and building owners in delivering and demonstrating high performing and sustainable buildings. It is based on best practices, climate science, analyses of large building performance data sets, and global thought leadership. The scheme aims to further stretch building outcomes to reduce environmental impacts, with a focus on whole-life carbon, health and well-being, resilience, intelligence, and maintenance. Building Retrofit Energy Efficiency Pilot Scheme [97] Enables building owners with limited financial resources to go green by encouraging financial institutions to provide financing for energy efficiency retrofits. The BCA shares the risk of loan default with participating financial institutions that make loans to building owners and energy service companies carrying out green retrofits. Built Environment Transformation Gross Floor Area Incentive Scheme [97] Aims to increase adoption of enhanced Construction Industry Transformation Map standards in areas of digitalization, productivity, and sustainability in private sector developments. It applies to both residential and non-residential developments. Super Low Energy Buildings Program [98] Encourages firms to go beyond the current Green Mark Standards. A Super Low Energy Building must be powered by renewable energy sources, both on-site and off-site, with the former being prioritized. Building Energy Benchmarking Report [99] Commercial building owners must disclose data on energy consumption and efficiency to improve transparency and raise awareness about the energy performance of their buildings. GreenGov.SG initiative [4, 95] All new and existing public buildings (upon major retrofit) must meet Green Mark Platinum Super Low Energy standards or equivalent, where feasible. New public sector buildings must obtain Green Mark certification, including Green Mark Platinum for new buildings with an air-conditioned area greater than 5000 m2. Green Buildings Innovation Cluster Program [100] Promotes the development and implementation of promising energy-efficient building technologies and solutions in the tropics. It uses an integrated research, development, and demonstration hub to provide a platform for out-of-lab research results, encouraging building owners, consultants, and stakeholders to adopt innovative technologies in upcoming projects or existing buildings. 132 Urban Resilience and Sustainability Volume 2, Issue 2, 110–150. 7.4. Energy efficiency in households The government works to increase the role of households in climate change mitigation by designing energy-efficient public housing real estates that include innovative features such as solar panels on rooftops to power common services such as lifts and lights, together with public programs to encourage people to choose more efficient electrical appliances and adopt energy-saving habits. In general, air conditioners, water heaters, and refrigerators account for 52% of household energy consumption [101]. To encourage the use of more energy-efficient appliances, Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) and Mandatory Energy Labelling Schemes (MELS) have been introduced for air conditioners, refrigerators, televisions, clothes driers, and lamps [93]. MEPS eliminate energy inefficient models from the market, whereas MELS enable consumers to make more informed purchasing decisions. Since the introduction of both, the average energy efficiency of air conditioners and refrigerators has increased by about 13% and 26%, respectively. In 2020, NEA and PUB introduced the Climate-friendly Household Program to encourage households to purchase energy-efficient appliances and water-efficient shower fittings by providing vouchers to low-income residents [102]. Several public campaigns have been launched to encourage people to save energy at home while reducing electricity bills (https://www.climate-friendly-households.gov.sg). However, many residents are reluctant to modify their habits. The most recent household energy consumption study revealed slow progress in energy-saving actions [101]. For example, only 54% of households set their air conditioners to 25 C or higher. Those who do not believe the amount of money saved is insignificant. The ongoing initiative to install advanced electricity meters at residential premises is expected to reverse this situation and encourage consumers to be more energy efficient. These meters allow households to track their electricity consumption every half-hour via a mobile application and get a better idea of where and when they can start reducing their usage [103]. As of the end of 2020, about 400,000 such meters had been installed throughout Singapore; by 2026, the remaining 1.1 million homes will have them installed. 8. Transportation Singapore envisions a street layout that prioritizes walking, cycling, and public transportation, with autonomous vehicles complementing those transport modes in the future. The Land Transport Master Plan (LTMP) 2040 describes the strategies to meet such a vision [104]. Seventy-five percent of all peak-period journeys will be made on public transportation, up from 67% nowadays. All journeys to the nearest neighborhood center will take less than 20 minutes by a combination of walking, cycling, and riding public transportation, while nine out of ten peak-period journeys should take less than 45 minutes. The goal is to make walking, cycling, and public transportation so convenient, fast, and comfortable that commuters will prefer them over private commutes. More space will be reserved for public transportation, active mobility, and community uses. The streetscape will change so that people can easily walk and cycle to nearby bus stops, train stations, and other amenities. The rail and bus networks will grow, providing more connections while improving accessibility, reliability, and comfort. Figure 6 shows the current transportation trends, including ridership and travel time. 133 Urban Resilience and Sustainability Volume 2, Issue 2, 110–150. Figure 6. Transportation trends. (a) Ridership proportion and (b) travel time by transport mode among Singapore residents commuting to work [105]. (c) Average daily ridership by transport mode. Private vehicle ridership data are released every 4–5 years as part of the Household Interview Travel Survey [106,107]. The 2020 data in (a) and (b) do not account for temporary arrangements made due to COVID-19 restrictions, unlike data in (c). Taxi data in (c) include taxis, cars, and private-hire cars. The rail network consists of the Massive Rapid Transit (MRT) and Light Rail Transit (LRT) systems. In 2020, 57.7% of residents took trains and buses to get to work, which is up from 54.6% in 2010 (Figure 6a). The share of those who relied solely on a car for their work commutes dropped from 24.8% to 21.9%, while the proportion who travelled only by taxi or private-hire car increased from 1.3% to 3.0%. The share of residents who used other modes of transportation, such as motorcycles and private chartered buses, also decreased. About 9.8% of residents did not need any transportation to get to work in 2020, up from 7.5% in 2010; however, fewer people were cycling, with the proportion dropping to 1.6% from 2.1% and 4.7% in the previous 10 and 20 years, respectively [105]. While connectivity has improved, those who take the bus or train to work now travel longer distances than a decade ago. The median travel time to work increased from 30 minutes in 2010 to 37 minutes in 2020 for those commuting by public bus, and from 40 minutes to 45 minutes for those commuting by train (Figure 6b). Those who take the train and bus clocked 60 minutes in 2020, up from around 50 minutes in 2010 and 45 minutes in 2005. The corresponding travel time by car was 30 minutes in 2020, the same as 10 and 15 years before [105]. According to the Moovit Public Transit Index, the average one-way commute time including walk, waiting, and travel times on public transport is 47 minutes nowadays, with 30.8% spending up to 30 minutes and 19.9% spending one to two hours. Singapore residents commute from an average distance of 7.7 km, while 21.6% travel 12 km in a single 134 Urban Resilience and Sustainability Volume 2, Issue 2, 110–150. direction by public transport. Seventy-two percent of commuters must transfer at least once in their daily trips, with an average wait time of 9 minutes at bus stops and train stations [108]. A higher frequency of buses and trains, and in turn less crowded units and shorter waiting time at stations, in concert with clean, comfortable, and safe vehicles with better accessibility for people with needs (wheelchairs, ramps, etc.), closer bus stops and train stations to peoples’ homes and workplaces, accurate and reliable arrival times according to published schedules, and affordable cost fares, have contributed to increased public transportation ridership (Figure 6c). However, commuting by public transport still entails longer travel times compared to using private transportation (Figure 6b). One factor could be that more people now live farther away from their workplaces. New train lines and longer trunk bus routes could have also enabled more people to travel longer distances by public transportation. In contrast, traffic congestion has not worsened; the vehicular fleet has increased just 3.0% in 10 years, reaching a maximum of 947,704 vehicles in 2023, while the road network has expanded less than 6% [109]. The introduction of new public bus routes with direct connections and fewer stops along priority corridors (e.g., express lines and bus rapid transit systems), as well as the continued expansion of the rail network, will reduce commuting times. Ridership on public transport fell by about 34% in 2020 as a consequence of the measures taken to curb the spread of COVID-19, and by 2023, it had not returned to previous levels (Figure 6c). Vehicular traffic only experienced a drastic drop (51%) during the lockdown period (April 7–June 1, 2020). Less than two months after the lockdown, Singapore’s streets had already returned to pre-pandemic congestion levels [110]. The 56 days of the lockdown cut on average 40% of CO2 emission from vehicular traffic, but it was just a temporary relief, as it meant a reduction of only 7% in annual emissions [111]. An effective mitigation pathway will require an integrated life cycle assessment involving all transport modes and main strategies to reduce travel demand, promote a modal shift from private to public transportation, and improve vehicles efficiency by testing different technologies and scenarios [112]. 8.1. Public transport The Land Transport Authority (LTA) spearheads the operation and maintenance of transport infrastructure and systems, as well as harnesses technology to build a connected and integrated city by clean public transport and active transport modes that support a healthy lifestyle. The rail and bus networks are the backbone of Singapore’s land transportation (Figure S6). The rail network (Massive Rapid Transit, MRT) currently covers 230 km and is expected to grow to 360 km by 2030. According to the planned expansion, 8 out of 10 households will be within a 10-minute walk of a train station [113]. In addition, three light rail lines (Light Rail Transit, LRT) covering 29 km connect residents living in residential states to the nearest MRT station. Today, 140 well-equipped, modern, and clean stations on six MRT lines serve over 3.2 million passengers daily. Eleven of these stations are designated as Integrated Transport Hubs, with connections to bus interchanges. Almost 6,000 public buses ply the roads; 50% are double-decker buses, and the majority are powered by diesel engines under Euro V or VI emission standards [114]. More than 350 routes cover the city, with commuters waiting no more than 8 minutes to board a bus during peak hours and no more than 15 minutes during off-peak hours. Electric buses account for 1% of the fleet, but 360 new electric buses will be gradually introduced from 2025. By 2030, they are expected to make up half of the fleet, and the goal is to have a complete bus fleet that runs entirely on cleaner energy [115]. 135 Urban Resilience and Sustainability Volume 2, Issue 2, 110–150. Significant efforts have been made to make trains and buses the preferred commuting choice. The government recognizes that good public transportation is essential for all aspects of Singapore’s life. LTA owns the rail operating assets, while rail operators run and give maintenance to trains and stations, focusing on providing reliable and comfortable commutes. Similarly, new buses have been introduced into the system through a new bus service program in which LTA owns the buses and operating assets, such as depots, as well as the fleet management and ticketing systems, while private companies operate the service [116]. In the last decade, bus and train capacities have increased by 20% and 50%, respectively [113]. On average, a typical Singapore family using public transport on a daily basis spends 4.8% of their disposable income on transportation [117]. The fare structure is fully integrated, so there are no additional boarding fees when transferring between trains and buses. Bus and train fares are based on the distance travelled and charged in a granular manner (i.e., each fare band after the initial 3.2-km fare increases in denominations of 1 km). The fare is adjusted using a Network Capacity Factor, which caps the maximum allowable fare while accounting for changes in operating costs arising from network capacity adjustments versus commuter demand. Children, students, senior citizens, national servicemen, people with disabilities, and those on workfare income supplements are all eligible for concession rates. The government provides economic assistance to renew operating assets and subsidizes the system operation. This translates to more than SG$1.00 in subsidies per journey [118], making public transportation affordable for everyone. Singapore commuters value public transportation highly. The most recent annual survey on public transportation customer satisfaction revealed that 93% of commuters were satisfied with the service provided by buses and trains [119]. Commuters are generally satisfied with safety and security, reliability, service information, accessibility at bus stops and train stations, and customer services, but are somewhat dissatisfied with waiting and travel time, and comfort. Therefore, the commuting experience will improve by addressing crowding, commuting distance, and time pressures. Enjoyable commutes boost people’s moods, which in turn improves their work attitudes and performance, as well as their interactions with others [120]. 8.2. Private transport Controlling the rate of vehicle population growth, restricting car ownership, and managing traffic congestion by charging vehicles entering specific roads are examples of Singapore’s private transportation management measures. Restricting car use and reducing car ownership have controlled the environmental impact of private transportation, while road-pricing schemes have kept the city free of traffic congestion. Because charges are levied on a per-use basis, the negative externalities of road congestion caused by drivers are accounted for, encouraging commuters to use public transportation or alternative routes and travel times. Singapore was the first city to implement an electronic toll in 1998, with rates varying depending on the hour, location, traffic volume, and vehicle characteristics. The Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) system has proven to be an effective tool that forces drivers to become part of the solution rather than the problem. Current plans anticipate making the scheme more flexible, charging motorists according to the distance travelled on congested roads, rather than charging all motorists the same amount as long as they pass a gantry. Several studies have evaluated its effectiveness in managing traffic congestion as a unique example of innovation in the public sector [121–123]. 136 Urban Resilience and Sustainability Volume 2, Issue 2, 110–150. The number of vehicles on the roads is also controlled by the cost of owning a car. In addition to the sales tax, registration fee, an excise duty, and other special taxes, a Certificate of Entitlement (COE) is needed to get the legal right to own a car for a period of ten years [124]. The cost of this certificate is determined by demand, and it often exceeds the cost of the car itself. The CEO was introduced in 1990 as part of a Vehicle Quota System (VQS) limiting vehicle growth to 3% per year. Since 2018, the annual growth rate for private cars and motorcycles has been set at 0%, while the fleets of good vehicles and buses are set to a growth rate of 0.25%. Traffic pollution has been controlled through regulatory measures governing fuel composition, vehicle emission standards, vehicle inspection and maintenance programs, and scrapping old cars. Leaded gasoline was phased out in 1999. Since 2017, the use of ultra-low or near sulfur free (10 ppm) diesel and gasoline is mandatory. Every gasoline vehicle registered for the first time must meet the exhaust emission standards set by the Environmental Protection and Management (Vehicular Emissions) regulations. Emission standards have been tightened over the years to keep up with advances in vehicle technology. From 2018, all new diesel and gasoline vehicles have to meet Euro VI emission standards or equivalent [125]. Motorcycles are tightened to Euro IV standards. All vehicles are required to undergo mandatory periodic inspections to ensure that they meet the emission standards stipulated in the regulations. The inspection schedule is determined by the vehicle’s age and type, with older and diesel-powered vehicles having shorter inspection intervals [125]. To encourage early retirement of older vehicles, motorists receive a rebate for the COE and registration fee for a new car when they deregister vehicles with still valid COEs. The rebate is calculated based on the amount originally paid for the COE and its remaining validity. Owners have to send their cars for scrapping or exporting. This rebate works as a mechanism for controlling car population because with each deregistered car, a new car is registered. Despite the effectiveness of public policies aimed at restricting car ownership, Singapore has paradoxically created an environment that encourages car ownership. The success in keeping the city free of traffic has, ironically, encouraged residents to own cars. Commuters who drive can save at least 30 minutes per trip (Figure 6b). Trips on public transportation are at least twice as long as those in private vehicles, which encourages car ownership. In contrast to other large cities, parking is not an issue. Carparks in public housing states are abundant, and the government subsidizes their cost. Similarly, motorists do not have difficulty finding vacant lots to park their vehicles in office and commercial buildings. Furthermore, owing a car in Singapore is tagged to one’s wealth and class, thus many Singaporeans aspire to own a car. Making cars even more expensive and taking away carparking subsidies may not be an option for the government. However, in line with the vision of a “Car-Lite Singapore” introduced as part of the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint for 2015 to reduce reliance on cars and shift to public transportation, cycling, walking, and car-sharing services [126], it may be time to start reducing the number of annual COEs available for bidding to gradually reduce private car ownership. 8.3. Taxis and private-hire cars The taxi population has plummeted by 50.8%, from 27,695 units in 2013 to 13,620 in 2023. Meanwhile, the number of private-hire cars has nearly quintupled, increasing from 16,396 to 81,754, becoming the primary driver of demand. The dramatic increase of private-hire cars has also reduced the private car population by 5.8%, from 607,292 in 2013 to 572,014 in 2023 [109]. Currently, taxis account for 14% of total ridership, while private-hire cars account for 86%. To compensate for this situation, a new regulatory framework was released in 2020, granting taxi drivers 137 Urban Resilience and Sustainability Volume 2, Issue 2, 110–150. the ability to sign up with any ride-hailing company to provide fixed-fare rides [127]. The main difference between taxis and private-hire cars now is that taxis can pick up street-hail rides. However, the future of the taxi industry is uncertain. This situation creates an opportunity to improve public transportation, as well as to develop new transportation schemes for people looking for alternative ways to commute without owning a car. A good example is BlueSG, Singapore’s first large-scale electric-car-sharing service (Figure S7). BlueSG is a private initiative supported by the LTA and Singapore’s Development Board that provides access to a network of shared vehicles 24 hours a day all year round at 380 self-service charging stations located in public housing, downtown, and shopping malls throughout the city (www.bluesg.com.sg). It is a promising initiative, but the number of charging stations where cars must be parked after completing a trip should be significantly increased. If commuters cannot park close to their destination, there is no point in renting a car. Additionally, rental rates must become competitive. Nowadays, it is cheaper to call a private-hire car than to drive a BlueSG car. 8.4. Electric vehicles Singapore plans to phase out internal combustion engine vehicles by 2040. According to the SGP 2030, new registrations of diesel cars and taxis will end in 2025, and all new car and taxi registrations will be of cleaner-energy models starting in 2030 [4]. For passenger vehicles, the most promising clean energy option is electric vehicles. The share of electric vehicles in new car registration increased from 0.2% in 2020 to 18% in 2023, with a current count of approximately 11,000 electric vehicles, which is still a modest number when compared to the overall vehicular fleet; however, more than half of the taxi fleet has already switched to hybrid models. To accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles, an ambitious program has been launched to build charging points closer to people’s homes. The target is to build 60,000 charging points nationwide, with 40,000 in public car parks, and 20,000 in private premises. There are currently 2,200 charging points, but not all of them are open to the public. Electric vehicles are low-maintenance and cheaper to drive than gasoline cars, but they still need to achieve economies of scale. They cost more than gasoline cars, even though there are various incentives and rebates currently available in Singapore [128]. Another drawback is the time required to recharge their batteries. Fast chargers are still limited throughout the city, but they even take 40–50 minutes to charge a small electric car’s battery from zero to 80%. When it comes to lithium-ion batteries, we must also consider the electronic waste that could be generated in the absence of effective recycling management, as well as the environmental risk and human rights issues associated with the extraction of the raw materials used in their construction, such as cobalt and lithium [129,130]. The absence of tailpipe emissions will reduce personal exposure to airborne pollutants in traffic microenvironments [131–134], but it won’t completely eliminate traffic pollution. Non-exhaust emissions (i.e., brake abrasion, tire wear, and resuspension of road dust) will continue; studies have shown that electrification has little impact on particle emissions [135]. Similarly, Singapore generates most of its electricity from natural gas, although it is one of the cleanest fossil fuels, which still emits CO2 when burned as any other type of fossil fuel. This is without accounting for methane leaks into the atmosphere during the extraction of the gas [136]. At the end, carbon emissions would simply shift from cars to power plants. In terms of urban warming, electric engines produce less waste heat than internal combustion engines; however, the complete electrification of Singapore’s vehicular fleet is 138 Urban Resilience and Sustainability Volume 2, Issue 2, 110–150. unlikely to lead to a reduction in the near-surface temperature due to the typical atmospheric conditions of the city [137]. For these reasons, electric private vehicles should not be seen as the solution to reducing carbon emissions and addressing mobility needs. In many ways, they behave similarly to conventional cars, with nearly identical environmental and social consequences. They take up the same amount of road space and do not reduce traffic congestion, road traffic accidents will continue, and electric vehicles will eventually jeopardize the vision of a “Car-Lite Singapore”. 8.5. Active transport modes Currently, only about half of short journeys (< 20 minutes) are completed on foot or bicycle. The proportion of residents walking to work has increased slightly, but not the proportion of cyclists; 9.8% and 1.6% of residents walk and cycle to work, respectively (Figure 6a). Thus, there is room to increase active mobility by expanding the network of cycling paths throughout the city, and building convenient and covered paths for pedestrians to reach everyday amenities in their neighborhoods. The SGP 2030 aims to triple cycling paths’ lengths to 1,320 km from 460 km in 2020. Similarly, over 200 km of covered walkways have been built to connect schools, healthcare facilities, and other public amenities within a 400-meter radius of train stations, and within a 200-meter radius of bus interchanges and selected bus stops as part of the Walk2Ride program [138]. Also, a number of innovations in urban infrastructure have been made to improve accessibility and safety for pedestrians and cyclists, such as providing bicycle parking lots at public transportation nodes and public housing void decks, installing 40 lifts at overhead bridges, and constructing 50 silver zones with features to enhance walkability for the elderly. It is true that significant efforts are being made to expand and improve active mobility. Every day, more neighborhoods are connected by paths for pedestrians and cyclists. However, the response has been disappointing, as many commuters are reluctant to consider cycling as an option for daily transport (Figure 6a). Singapore residents walk on average 1.2 km to get around each day with public transportation, while 14% walk more than 2 km per day; but very few ride a bicycle to complete their trips, with 74% of commuters refusing to ride one [108]. Only one-third of those who claim to ride a bicycle often do so to complete the first and last leg of their trips. Many people consider it is unsafe since there are not enough dedicated bicycle lanes, which is true in many areas of the city. Most cycling paths have been built within and between residential states, but they do not connect to workplaces. Many paths have been built for recreational purposes, i.e., Park Connectors [139], but without taking into account daily commutes. Nowadays, cyclists compete for space with pedestrians and drivers. They can ride on roads, footpaths, and sidewalks causing chaos and putting everyone in danger. There has been much debate about it, and a concrete solution has not been found [140]. There appears to be a fear of returning to street layouts similar to those of the 1960s and 1970s, when cycling was the predominant mode of transportation and several roads had dedicated bicycle lanes next to footpaths. A set of rules and a code of conduct for cyclists are in place seeking the safe sharing of public paths among various users [141,142]. However, it is unclear if these rules are enough to solve the problem and encourage the use of bicycles on a regular basis [143]. Bold policies are needed to give priority to pedestrians over cyclists, and cyclists over motorists. These policies will undoubtedly lead to the opening of exclusive lanes for cyclists along main throughfares to the detriment of motorists, but will align with the vision of a “Car-Lite Singapore”. 139 Urban Resilience and Sustainability Volume 2, Issue 2, 110–150. Cycling became popular during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Surveys show that it tripled in popularity [144]. Singaporeans increasingly view cycling as more than just a sport or recreation, so now is probably the best time to transform the layout of Singapore’s streets and build a comprehensive cycling network that allows people to ride almost anywhere at speeds of 7–8 km in half an hour. The cycling network will require the implementation of a system of docked shared bicycles properly integrated into the train and bus networks, with dedicated racks close to people’s homes and workplaces. Dockless bicycle-sharing platforms have already proven to be inefficient (Figure S8). Thousands of dockless shared bicycles flooded the city in 2017, eventually clogging sidewalks. One year later, LTA passed a bill requiring all operators to take steps to ensure that their customers practice responsible parking. This included requiring users to scan a unique QR code at the parking location as proof of correct parking [145]. Failure to do so resulted in additional charges on top of the rental fee, as well as bans on future rentals. Only two of the eight initial operators remain on the market, and they have yet to be taken to the ground. 8.6. Migrant workers transportation The statistics in Figure 6 do not account for the use of lorries to transport migrant workers. Over 440,000 low-wage workers are transported daily from dormitories to workplaces in sectors such as construction, manufacturing, and cleaning [146]. They are seated in the back of these vehicles, without seat belts or other safety features to protect them in the event of a collision. They are also exposed to bad weather; in the event of rain, they become soaked. It is common to see lorries overloaded with workers, equipment, and materials. Many employers claim that exclusive bus transportation for their workers would raise the operation costs for their business [147]. It is urgent to address the system flaws that force migrant workers to take inappropriate and dangerous transportation. They must be transported safely, comfortably, and with dignity. Additional costs cannot be used as an excuse to avoid hiring buses and minivans for their transportation. Authorities must recognize migrant workers as equals rather than as production factors. They are part of Singapore’s society. 8.7. Freight land transport Trucks, which account for 16.7% of all vehicular traffic in Singapore, are the primary mode of transportation for goods. An estimated 4,000 trucks make over 20,000 delivery trips daily and take up approximately 25% of Singapore’s road space [126]. As part of the Infocomm Media 2025 Plan, the government is testing new technologies and models to consolidate and coordinate a comprehensive logistics system, leading to a more efficient use of delivery trucks and increased productivity in the sector, and contributing to the vision of a “Car-Lite City”. The implementation of an in-mall distribution model, offsite consolidation centers, and federated lockers and collection points is expected to reduce the number of trucks on the road by a quarter, delivery manpower by 40%, and delivery waiting and queuing time by 65% [148]. The in-mall model employs services provided by a third-party in-mall operator to perform centralized receiving of goods on behalf of tenants before redistributing them at scheduled times. This reduces wait time and allows delivery trucks to achieve much faster turnaround times at the docks by ensuring that goods are received in a coordinated manner. The initial application of this model in selected malls was well-received, reporting significant time savings and increased efficiency. 140 Urban Resilience and Sustainability Volume 2, Issue 2, 110–150. The consolidation of freight distribution in offsite centers equipped with advanced sorting processes aims to maximize the efficiency of each delivery trip before delivering goods to shopping malls and other destinations. Combining same-destination deliveries will reduce truckload utilization, and therefore trips generation [149]. In anticipation of continued changes in retail patterns and rapid growth of e-commerce, Singapore is already deploying a nationwide network of parcel lockers in public locations to speed up home deliveries and lower operating costs. Currently, over 1,000 lockers have been installed. This system allows for 6–10 times the number of drop-offs completed by a local courier company in one day [149]. New schemes based on the so called “Industry 4.0” model for Singapore’s logistics ecosystem are under consideration [150]. These schemes propose new models based on emerging technologies that will transform the logistics market, and movement of goods. However, the benefits of the models already tested have not been disclosed. Before moving forward with even more advanced freight transportation models, they must be thoroughly evaluated in terms of their effectiveness toward a circular economy model. 9. Final remarks Singapore began its journey toward circularity about 50 years ago, when the first plans and strategies for sustainable water management were drawn, eventually closing the water loop and ensuring that everyone had access to clean water at home. Science and technology have been key in unlocking water solutions, as well as community efforts to keep water use sustainable and efficient [2]. The current challenge is to extend circularity’s success to all other sectors of the economy and daily life activities, while the city as a whole continues to serve as a hub for trade, manufacturing, banking and commerce, transportation and shipping, energy and infrastructure, technological development, education, and culture. The implementation of a circular approach in all economic sectors will contribute to building a sustainable society in which all citizens can find the conditions to forge a successful future while taking into account the well-being of everyone, including transient workers who are essential to Singapore’s urban landscape. Singapore must reassess its economy, production, and consumption rhythms along with its ASEAN neighbors and beyond to achieve a fully circular economy. Singapore’s economy is dependent on regional development, as well as the choreography of actions that move the regional and global economy and, inevitably, have an impact on the environment. It is still too early to evaluate Singapore’s efforts to achieve a balance between economic growth, social equity, and environmental sustainability as a whole. However, it is safe to say that Singapore has the foundations in place to meet its ambitious environmental goals, as well as the confidence to make them a reality. Singapore has drawn the institutional framework to build a circular system to become a zero-waste and zero-carbon-emitting nation by mid-century. Enforcement is currently under construction. Nevertheless, there are still aspects to consider and policies to refine. The framework for implementing a circular system must be constantly evolving in order to face the threats posed by a changing climate, a society exposed to technological advances, and a myriad of political and economic challenges. Similar to enforcement, the development of metrics and monitoring tools to assess progress in implementing policies to achieve circularity are still under construction. Singapore has set clear 141 Urban Resilience and Sustainability Volume 2, Issue 2, 110–150. timelines for turning circular, but mechanisms to assess its progress have yet to be defined. Periodic assessment of the benefits gained from moving to a circular system in all economic sectors could help avoid delays and risks in the implementation of such an approach. Note that Singapore’s circularity cannot be compared to that of other countries because it is a city-state and thus a one-of-a-kind example. Nonetheless, Singapore’s success and experience in designing and implementing circular economy policies could serve as a model for other high-density and rapidly expanding ASEAN cities, as well as any city in the tropics in general. Singapore can be used as an example to gain a better understanding of what a circular city might be [151]. Although there are no mechanisms in place to assess a city’s level of circularity, Singapore can be considered a city leading the way in the transition to a circular economy in sectors such as water, urban mobility, housing and infrastructure, and energy efficiency. In sectors such as recycling, food waste, and renewable energy, for example, new policies and financial incentives have been enacted, the results of which shall be seen in the near future. 9.1. Barriers in implementing a circular economic model Singapore, a small but advanced urban economy, has achieved a high-quality living environment. It has learned to integrate urban and transportation planning, solve energy and food supply issues, and merge environment and health with social inclusion and economic progress. However, Singaporeans should not take these achievements for granted forever. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that unexpected events can easily break the current framework. The pandemic exposed our society’s flaws and showed the need for more ambitious and concrete action plans to build resilient and inclusive nations in harmony with the environment. We need to replace the current linear economic model of “take-make-dispose” with a circular one that prioritizes reductions in resource production and products consumption. This is a hard task for a society that relentlessly strides toward material success. Excessive consumerism has become a typical feature of Singapore’s culture (Figure S9). Singapore’s society is characterized as being excessively materialistic, self-centered, and competitive [152]. It is not a secret that material wealth and possessions are seen as status symbols in Singapore; consider the infamous “five Cs”, which many Singaporeans still aspire to: cash, car, credit card, condominium, and country club membership. True, some of these aspirations resonate less with younger Singaporeans today, but they are still deeply ingrained in Singapore’s society. Singaporeans need to explore their relationship with the natural world in order to solve environmental problems. They need to change their mindset and realize that the environment is not “out there”, but rather that they are a part of it. It is time to reconsider what is at stake if they continue to live a life full of material aspirations consuming the world around them. Despite being at the forefront of innovation and technology, as well as an example of governance, Singapore is still figuring out how to curb its excessive consumerism in order to reduce its environmental footprint. Ultimately, innovative and bold policies, sound science, and well-chosen technology can lead to circularity, but it will not be possible without a strong commitment from the entire society. Environmental problems must also be examined from the perspectives of the social sciences, humanities, education, communication, and arts. Scientists and scholars must develop clear and simple messages, and work closely with journalists, who are the ideal vehicle for communicating scientific and technical information to a lay audience. The media has the power to educate, influence, and drive 142 Urban Resilience and Sustainability Volume 2, Issue 2, 110–150. changes in mindset and action across all sectors of society, including citizens of all ages and idiosyncrasies. The most challenging aspect to achieve circularity is the human component. Sustainable development must be based on culture. Singaporeans need to cultivate an appreciation for the landscape that they have built and start looking for their own happiness to achieve a stable and peaceful future. Singaporeans do not have time to enjoy the clean and safe landscape that they have built due to the hustle and bustle of everyday life (Figure S10). They are exposed to a highly competitive environment from a young age, and grow up getting used to being stressed all the time [153]. Studies have found that they wake up exhausted even after 7–8 hours of sleep [154,155]. In addition, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, the boundaries between work and home have blurred, resulting in increased stress and less rest. An unhappy, stressed, and tired society will never work together to achieve meaningful and long-term environmental solutions. Singaporeans must change their work-life balance paradigm, not only to be able to work collectively to implement a circular system, but also for their own sake and happiness.

To maintain that status, Singapore has set a goal of achieving net zero carbon emissions by mid-century and reducing waste sent to landfills by 30% by 2030. To achieve this goal, the Government has laid out a comprehensive plan for implementing a circular economy model across all economic sectors. It includes a set of measures tailored to its unique city-state conditions that will necessarily require the joint effort of authorities, industry, companies, academia, and citizens. This article reviewed and analyzed the strategies and policies that Singapore has devised to implement such a model in four sectors identified as the highest priority by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Economic Community: waste management, food and agriculture, energy, and transportation. The analysis aimed to provide information to close the gap between aspirations and reality by identifying factors that allow progress toward planned objectives, as well as externalities and barriers that act in the opposite direction. For this endeavor, a gap analysis was carried out to look into the interconnections between the natural environment, regulatory framework and policies, governance, infrastructure, technology and innovation, and societal habits. In general, the institutional framework necessary for the transition into a resilient and resource-efficient nation is already in place, while enforcement and monitoring mechanisms to assess progress are under construction.

Domestic waste [1] per capita decreased by more than 15 per cent, and non-domestic waste [2] per dollar GDP by more than 30 per cent over the past decade. This indicates that households and companies have taken positive steps to reduce and reuse.\n**Per capita and per GDP waste generated decreased in past decade  \n**The daily domestic waste generated per capita decreased from 1.08 kg in 2013 to 0.88 kg in 2023.\n\nFig. 1. A chart on the daily domestic waste generated per capita from 2013 to 2023.\nThe daily non-domestic waste generated per dollar GDP decreased from 40 tonnes in 2013 to 26 tonnes in 2023.\n\nFig. 2. A chart on the daily non-domestic waste generated per dollar GDP from 2013 to 2023.\nRecycling rate declined due to structural factors\nThere was a decline in the overall recycling rate over the past decade, especially for paper and cardboard. Paper recycling dropped from over 50 per cent a decade ago to 31 per cent in 2023. This is largely due to structural factors such as freight costs and commodity prices.\nThe overall recycling rate decreased from 57 per cent in 2022 to 52 per cent in 2023, largely due to the amount of construction and demolition (C&D) waste, which is almost completely recycled, dropping significantly last year. Excluding C&D waste, the overall recycling rate in 2023 was 45 per cent, which is comparable to 2022’s rate at 46 per cent.\n\nFig. 3. A chart on the total waste generated from 2013 to 2023.\n\nFig. 4. A chart on the overall recycling rate from 2013 to 2023.\nRedoubling efforts to improve recycling and resource recovery\nNEA promotes the 3Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle) in working towards the goal of a Zero Waste Nation. As part of the Singapore Green Plan and Zero Waste Masterplan, we developed a suite of initiatives to shift attitudes and behaviours to make the 3Rs the norm for citizens and businesses. NEA also continues to study and develop new ways to close the various resource loops. This includes exploring the use of mixed materials from Semakau Landfill, which comprise incineration ashes and other waste materials, as reclamation fill.\nHousehold recycling participation has been on an uptrend. According to NEA’s 2023 survey on household recycling [3], 72 per cent of households recycle compared to 64 per cent in 2021. In addition, a higher proportion of survey respondents are aware of common items that can be deposited into the recycling bins and chutes. NEA recognises that individual efforts to conserve our resources are vital, and encourages households to not just recycle more, but also to recycle right.\nThere is a greater urgency for each of us to build a sustainability culture where we reduce, reuse, and recycle. By reducing waste and recycling right, we can do our part to combat climate change and ensure that Singapore remains clean, green, and liveable.\n\n[1] Domestic waste is waste collected from households and trade premises (e.g., shophouses, educational institutions, petrol stations, hawker centres and places of worship).\n[2] Non-domestic waste is waste generated at industrial and commercial premises.\n[3] https://www.nea.gov.sg/media/news/news/index/72-per-cent-of-households-recycle-in-2023\nANNEX A\n2013 to 2023 Overall Waste and Recycling Statistics\n(with and without Construction and Demolition waste)\n\nThe overall recycling rate decreased from 57 per cent in 2022 to 52 per cent in 2023 largely due to the amount of Construction and Demolition (C&D) waste, which is almost completely recycled, dropping significantly last year. Excluding C&D waste, the overall recycling rate in 2023 was 45 per cent, which is comparable to 2022’s rate at 46 per cent.\nC&D waste decreased by more than 40 per cent in 2023, compared to 2022, because there were fewer demolition projects. Such waste is a key industrial waste stream that is generated in large amounts. Hence, sharp Year-on-Year swings in the amount of such waste would result in huge fluctuations to the non-domestic and overall recycling rates.

Megacities face challenges in developing sustainable waste management systems. Considerable heterogeneity exists across megacities in management strategies. The two selected emerging megacities, Singapore (a city-state) and Shanghai, have similar developmental characteristics, but their waste management modes differ strikingly. This study assessed the two modes in terms of management strategies, environmental effects, economic costs, and social outcomes. Environmental footprint analysis and cost quantification were employed for the assessment based on public data. The research results would permit a deeper understanding of the long-term sustainability of each mode while considering the feasibility of implementation across different contexts. It was found that the waste management system in Singapore had a relatively lower environmental impact than Shanghai before Shanghai's new waste segregation and recycling policy in 2019. However, when the effect of fossil fuel substitution is taken into account, the environmental burden in Shanghai can be lowered more substantially than the one in Singapore. Although Shanghai had more economic burden for the waste segregation at source, it tended to implement the circular economy principles (e.g., reduce, reuse, and recycling) better and improve its sense of community significantly. Based on the practical experiences from the two representative megacities, suggestions for better waste management practices were provided for Singapore, Shanghai, and other emerging megacities with similar circumstances. In addition, challenges and opportunities related to household waste segregation and recycling were identified to guide future practices in emerging megacities.\nGraphical abstract\n\n\nDownload: Download high-res image (145KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\n\nIntroduction\nWith fast-paced urbanisation and economic development, densely populated megacities are facing a growing challenge to manage household solid waste (HSW) (Yousefloo and Babazadeh, 2020). The total amount of waste is expected to reach 3.40 billion (1 0 9) t globally by 2050, with approximately a third of the waste being mismanaged by dumping or burning (Kaza et al., 2018). This poses great pressure on megacities in particular, concerning land scarcity, food waste, and resource recovery (Zhang et al., 2018). Waste segregation is regarded as a plausible method to decrease the demand for landfills (Xiao et al., 2020b). After all, segregation and recycling is a promising path to reduce waste (Sheau-Ting et al., 2016), conserve natural resources, lower air pollution (Giovanis, 2015), save energy, and increase economic benefits (Ayodele et al., 2018), which contributes towards a sustainable circular economy (Malinauskaite et al., 2017). In this regard, considerable efforts have been made by megacities in recent years to promote HSW segregation and recycling, while their waste management systems have been developing on different scales.\nAt present, household waste with a high recovery value is basically required to separate from other waste (Chu et al., 2021). A dispute lies in whether wet waste should be separated, as it is considered to have less resource recovery value. Household waste in Singapore (Ng et al., 2017), Thailand, and Japan (Liu et al., 2020) is brought to incineration plants or landfills without any systematic separation of wet waste from other general waste. Progressively, the increasing concerns on environmental protection and circular economy have led to the advocation of compulsive front-end segregation efforts in waste management policies. For instance, some cities in European countries (Nie et al., 2018), South Korea (Yang et al., 2015), and China (Xiao et al., 2020a) instituted laws requiring residents to separate household wet waste from general waste. With waste segregation, wet waste can be recycled and treated using anaerobic fermentation and composting before being incinerated or landfilled (Nie et al., 2018). The aforementioned facts result in different management strategies worldwide.\nMegacities are adopting heterogeneous strategies in sustainable HSW management due to differences in the level of economic development and operational conditions (Kaza et al., 2018). Each experience and strategy could offer valuable insights to improve current HSW management systems (Aslam et al., 2020). Fan et al. (2019) compared the segregation systems between Singapore and Shanghai by looking into their psychological factors, while other significant aspects of waste management (i.e., environmental, economic and social effects) subject to the new policy should also be accounted for. Nie et al. (2018) assessed the social, environmental, and economic benefits from waste segregation in a local area, i.e., the Pudong district of Shanghai, without considering cross-cultural differences and comparing with other areas or regions. Gu et al. (2021) emphasised the cases of various recyclable waste recycling potentials from different cities in China and compared them with other cities in the world. Fan et al. (2021a) compared the waste generation in Singapore, Shanghai and Brno in the Czech Republic, which is mainly used to discuss the changes in waste volume during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, there are still some research gaps identified in the literature:\n\n\n(i)\nStudies that utilise comparison and contrast approaches in a comprehensive perspective in terms of management strategies, environmental effects, economic costs, and social outcomes are few and far between.\n\n\n(ii)\nThe existing comparison amongst megacities is required to be updated. For example, the largest metropolis, Shanghai in China, has implemented new waste segregation and recycling policy since 2019. With the same logic, the associated challenges and opportunities need to be the latest in a digitalisation and pandemic age.\n\n\n(iii)\nExperiences to facilitate HSW management in a place of concern were generally extracted from a similar but advanced waste management system. How to produce mutual learning experiences from two waste management modes that differ strikingly (e.g., source segregation and endpoint segregation) are relatively rare.\n\n\nIn view of growing environmental, economic, and social concerns, this study aims to address the mentioned gaps by investigating the effectiveness and long-term sustainability of two representative waste management modes. With this goal, a comparative analysis that assesses two management modes from two emerging megacities - Singapore (a city-type state with advanced economic development) and Shanghai (the economy-centre city of China) - is carried out. The Singapore mode pays more attention to the development of the backend collection and treatment technology but still lacks control in the front stream of household waste (Zhang et al., 2010). In contrast, the Shanghai mode is striving to control household waste at its source by imposing a compulsory waste segregation policy on waste producers (Jiang et al., 2020). An overview of environmental, economic, and social perceptions is provided to identify the long-term sustainability of each approach while considering the feasibility of implementation across different contexts. This comparison study enables an improved understanding of the value and effectiveness of waste management under different systems. The benefits and disadvantages of the two modes are salutary experiences for each other and other similar megacities. Challenges and opportunities related to household waste segregation and recycling are also raised to provide policymakers with insights for working towards sustainable solutions in future.\nThis paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the background and comparison framework. Section 3 presents comparison results and discussion, encompassing four different aspects. Section 4 summarises the crucial mutual learning experiences to improve the HSW systems, including the other megacities. Section 5 highlights the challenges and opportunities. Section 6 concludes this paper and provides future research agenda.\nSection snippets\nBackground and comparison framework\nThe background of waste management in Singapore and Shanghai is introduced in Section 2.1. A comparison framework is presented in Section 2.2.\nComparison results and discussion\nThis section compares the HSW management system in Singapore and Shanghai on their management strategies, environmental effects, economic costs, and social outcomes.\nExperiences to facilitate HSW management\nEven though the waste management modes in Singapore and Shanghai contrast starkly, such initiatives can facilitate new innovations in waste management through learning from each other, as shown in Fig. 4. The experiences could permit an in-depth understanding of the feasibility of implementing such policies across megacities with similar characteristics.\nChallenges and opportunities\nGovernments, business sectors, and the public have all been affected by widespread global changes. The current waste management strategies are also confronting stakeholders with formidable policy challenges. While these challenges are complex, they can also be perceived as potential opportunities to engage in effective and sustainable solutions.\nConclusions\nBoth Singapore and Shanghai are urbanised and innovative megacities with well-developed economies and technologies. With its limited domestic market and natural resources, Singapore faced potential economic and urban development challenges primarily due to ongoing waste management issues. As a comparison, before the new waste management policy, Shanghai had a considerable waste generation volume and a relatively high landfill rate, leading to some environmental impact.

For instance, Taiwan (Wang and Lin, 2022), Hongkong (Kurniawan et al., 2021), and Singapore (Zhou et al., 2022) separate types of waste into recyclable and nonrecyclable wastes. In the short term, waste separation should be incentivized by assigning color preferences to and enhancing the noticeability of trash bins (Ferronato et al., 2021) and collection containers and by implementing punishment and rewards (Wang et al., 2021) and economic profits (Xu et al., 2018).\nShow abstract\nAmidst global pushes for sustainable land development, Jakarta confronts pressing municipal solid waste management (MSWM) issues, with limited landfill capacities and rampant illegal dumping in slum and non-slum areas, exacerbating land consumption challenges. This context underscores the urgency to explore adaptive MSWM strategies that align with broader sustainable land planning objectives. This research aims to distinguish and shed light on the MSWM preferences of Jakarta’s non-slum and slum residents. The emphasis is placed on their importance-performance (I-P) preferences related to adaptive MSWM strategies. An in-depth evaluation involved twelve indicators across five adaptive capacity dimensions, correlating them with the I-P metrics and the participant demographics. Both slum and non-slum communities underscored the importance of bolstering the circular economy and waste segregation. However, a pronounced awareness regarding waste treatment was observed among non-slum residents. On the other hand, individuals from slum locales indicated a greater need for focused encouragement and resources to engage in waste segregation initiatives effectively. The insights from this study are pivotal for urban planners, policymakers, and scholars. Recommendations span from instituting self-reminder systems, enhancing collection services, and ensuring strict regulatory compliance to endorsing waste bank participation and mobilizing local community leaders, or cadres, to lead sustainable MSWM endeavors. By fostering a harmonious MSWM ecosystem, smart cities like Jakarta can ensure equitable and progressive MSWM for all its residents, thus moving closer to a sustainable urban future.\n\n\nHow to promote municipal household waste management by waste classification and recycling? A stochastic tripartite evolutionary game analysis\n2023, Journal of Environmental Management\nCitation Excerpt :\nLu and Sidortsov (2019) concluded that government-volunteer consortium and peer-pressure effect contributed to waste-management co-production. Zhou et al. (2022) compared the two HWM modes adopted in Singapore and Shanghai and assessed their environmental impact prior to 2019. Moreover, some scholars investigated HWM from the perspective of participant behavior, such as waste reduction, reuse, and recycling behaviors (Barr, 2007), empowerment and pro-environmental behavior (Vorobeva et al., 2022), behavior that minimized climate change (Nordin et al., 2020), and the direct impact of food waste behaviors (Berjan et al., 2022), etc.\nShow abstract\nMunicipal household waste management (MHWM) is crucial for urban governance and sustainable development. Currently, Chinese governments at all levels are making great effort to implement MHWM through waste classification and recycling (WCR). However, the major participants in WCR, such as urban residents, property management companies and government departments, may act in their self-interest and hinder the MHWM goals. Therefore, it has become an imperative initiative to promote MHWM by effectively coordinate their conflicts of interest. Considering that external factors with complexity and uncertainty may also affect participants' behaviors, we develop a stochastic tripartite evolutionary game to model behavioral interaction of the three participants. Then we derive theoretical results and simulate different scenarios to examine the effects of key factors on participants’ strategy evolution. The results show that stochastic interference, cost reduction and rules simplification contribute to WCR of MHWM, and reward and performance improvement benefits have different incentive effects. Moreover, credit-based punishment and disclosure of non-compliance are more effective than financial-based penalty. To promote MHWM, policymakers should not only simplify classification rules, lower participation cost and enhance credit-based punishment system, but also encourage anonymous report and apply well-designed financial-based incentive and penalty.\n\n\nCitizens’ willingness to pay for adaptive municipal solid waste management services in Jakarta, Indonesia-\n2023, Sustainable Cities and Society\nShow abstract\nThe capability of municipal solid waste management (MSWM) services and the system's sustainability are significant challenge in developing cities like Jakarta. MSWM provides a comprehensive, adaptive capacity framework for addressing problems in resource-constrained developing nations where poor assets, flexibility, social organization, learning, and agency have no adaptive means of regaining them. This paper aim to conduct an evaluation framework under adaptive MSWM, estimates citizens’ preferences heterogeneity and, evaluates willingness-to-pay (WTP) under hypothetical scenarios of future adaptive MSWM retribution. The findings indicate that adaptive MSWM services substantially impact the decision to expand their environment. In addition, citizens who supported the adaptive MSWM services tended to have a higher income than the minimum wage, live outside of slums, are older than 39 years, and are aware of climate change and the current MSWM system and infrastructure. The findings imply that policymakers must enhance citizen MSWM awareness of climate change and infrastructure used to dealing with adaptability strategies. Finally, we establish three adaptive MSWM scenario for sustainable services with the optimization of the MSWM system and infrastructure, community-based MSWM, and smart MSWM system and infrastructure.\n\n\nBlockchain technology applications in waste management: Overview, challenges and opportunities\n2023, Journal of Cleaner Production\nShow abstract\nRapid population growth and urbanisation have accelerated waste generation, and effective waste management has become a major challenge worldwide. With advances in technology and management methods, waste management strategies have begun embracing digitalisation, leveraging the Internet of Things (IoT), big data analytics, cloud/edge computing, machine learning, 5G communication, and blockchain technologies. Amongst them, the blockchain technology has the structural features of achieving information security and integrity without central guarantees. Blockchain also meets the data record/storage needs of waste management and the design of new mechanisms for effective waste management. These benefits make blockchain an attractive technology in the field of waste management, with researchers and practitioners alike investigating its broad applications to support sustainable waste management. However, this emerging technology has not yet been widely accepted by potential users. To further champion the application of blockchain technology, this review paper provides a systematic overview of the various pathways in which the technology has been applied in the waste management industry and further discusses its related challenges and opportunities via considering the promising prospect of combining blockchain technology with IoT, artificial intelligence (AI) and life cycle assessment (LCA). This review also provides insights for interpreting some emerging applications of blockchain in the field of waste management and clarifying the research paths in the context of blockchain, digitalised waste management, and circular economy.\n\n\nImpacts of garbage classification and disposal on the occurrence of pharmaceutical and personal care products in municipal solid waste leachates: A case study in Shanghai\n2023, Science of the Total Environment\nShow abstract\nLeachate generated during the treatment and disposal of municipal solid wastes (MSWs) can be an important source of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) in the environment. With the implementation of garbage classification policy in China, the disposal methods of MSWs have changed, while its impacts on the occurrence of PPCPs in the generated leachate remain unknown. In this study, we investigated 49 target PPCPs in the leachates of classified MSWs, i.e. residual waste leachate (RWL) and food waste leachate (FWL), and revealed the influence of garbage classification implementation on the occurrence of PPCPs in leachates to be treated. The results showed the concentration and mass load of target PPCPs in the RWL samples (median values: 34.9 ng/L and 52.3 mg/d, respectively) were significantly higher than those in the FWL samples (median values: 19.3 ng/L and 14.5 mg/d, respectively). Macrolide (ML) antibiotics were the predominant PPCPs in the RWL samples, while in the FWL samples, quinolone (QL) antibiotics exhibited the highest concentration and mass load. The implementation of garbage classification policy led to the reduction of PPCP mass load (from 739 g/d to 262 g/d) in leachates to be treated. The findings are helpful for better designing or managing MSW treatment and disposal processes to minimize the emission of PPCPs from MSW leachates.\n\n\nThe Plastic Age: River Pollution in China from Crop Production and Urbanization\n2023, Environmental Science and Technology\n\n\nView all citing articles on Scopus\nView full text\n© 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

The rest is incinerated, with a slight fraction sent to landfill. The landfill \"island,\" called Semakau, was created in 1999 and extended in 2015, with enough space to meet Singapore's waste disposal needs until at least 2035.\nThe waste management industry in Singapore majorly consists of all municipal solid waste (MSW) - including non-hazardous waste generated in households, commercial establishments, and institutions, and non-hazardous industrial process wastes, agricultural wastes, and sewage sludge. The industry's value represents the amount of total typical charge per ton for landfill multiplied by the volume of MSW generated. The industry's volume represents the total MSW generation.\nSingapore Waste Management Market Trends\nGrowing Food and Beverage Sector in Singapore\nSingapore’s food and beverage industry is a vital sector that contributes significantly to the country’s economy. The F&B industry in Singapore has undergone various changes in the last few years, with the COVID-19 pandemic impacting the industry’s growth and trends.\nIn 2022, the recycling rate for food waste generated in Singapore remained at the highest in the measured period, at 18 percent. In comparison, the food waste recycling rate was 13 percent in 2013 and has steadily increased over this period.\nIn Singapore, the impact of climatic shifts and supply disruptions can be distinctly felt by the city-state, which imports more than 90 percent of its food. To address this, the Singapore food agency has committed to gaining greater food resilience by setting a “30 by 30” goal, with the aim of producing 30 percent of local nutritional needs by 2030. However, with less than one percent of land designated for farming, Singapore must produce more with fewer resources. Faced with these challenges, the nation needs to reduce food waste while sustainably increasing food production.\nIn Singapore, food producers generally need help managing food waste due to the high cost of implementing waste management solutions. As a result, the city-state produced an estimated 813,000 tonnes of food waste, accounting for 12 percent of the total waste produced. At the same time, as many as 783 million people worldwide faced hunger in 2022.\n\nUnderstand The Key Trends Shaping This Market\nDownload PDF\nIncrease in E-waste Generation\nSingapore generates about 60,000 tonnes of e-waste annually, which equals 70 devices per person.\nSingapore's overall waste generation rose by 18 per cent last year - the first increase after four years of decline - as economic activity picked up after the loosening of COVID-19 restrictions. In all, about 6.94 million tonnes of solid waste were generated last year 2022, compared with the 5.88 million tonnes in 2020, said the National Environment Agency (NEA) in its annual waste and recycling report.\nTo nudge households to step up their recycling efforts, NEA is also planning to distribute recycling containers to those that want them in the later part of 2022.\nTo ensure compliance, Singapore’s government designated ALBA Group Asia, the regional branch of a German recycling company, as the program operator. The company is now responsible for not just keeping producers accountable, but also overseeing e-waste collection. Producers are required to hand over the waste they collect to ALBA, while the company also organizes collection drives and liaises with town councils to gather waste from across the nation. ALBA has also placed 600 e-waste bins in Singapore’s urban area, making it easy for people to dispose of their used waste.\n\nGet Analysis on Important Geographic Markets\nDownload PDF\nSingapore Waste Management Industry Overview\nSingapore Waste Management looks fragmented, offering many opportunities for new companies to enter the market. Singapore-based companies operate across the entire waste management value chain, from collection and recycling to waste treatment, energy recovery, and landfill management. They offer integrated services to optimize efficiency and deliver long-term, sustainable solutions. Major Players include Sembcorp Environmental Management Pte. Ltd.
