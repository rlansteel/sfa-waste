I like to specially thank Deloitte & Touche Enterprise Risk Services Pte Ltd for their unwavering commitment in the past six months. I would also like to acknowledge all respondents and our partners, Coca-Cola Singapore, NTUC Income, Singapore Manufacturing Federation, CASE, Mahota Singapore, Singapore Packaging Agreement, NWCDC, SWCDC, CSCDC, and Tzu Chi Singapore, who have participated in the study. We greatly value the contributions of our partners in our efforts to help shape the future of plastics in Singapore. Our plastic ecosystem is mostly linear, which means that plastic goes from producers to consumers, to the waste bin. This places a strain on our waste management systems as well as uses up an enormous amount of natural resources. Plastics are not going away. They are an essential part of modern living and contribute many good things, such as ensuring food hygiene, efficient packaging and proper storage. Singapore’s increasing consumption of plastics is widely discussed in the media, especially our use of plastic bags, disposable plastic items and PET bottles. Our study focuses on three segments of the plastic ecosystem, upstream producers’ responsibilities including packaging, consumer lifestyles including recycling behaviour, and downstream processes including waste management. The study also reveals the extent of consumer plastic use as well as the way plastic bags, plastic disposables and PET bottles are reused, recycled or discarded. The study found that people in Singapore use about 1.76 billion plastic items each year. This figure includes 820 million plastic bags from supermarkets, 467 million PET bottles, and 473 million plastic disposable items like takeaway containers. One factor which exacerbates the issue is our low recycling rate, at 6 per cent in 2017. According to the research, the reason for the low recycling rate includes a lack of public awareness of what can be recycled, as well as the entire landscape of recycling in Singapore. As a result, the majority of plastic products are disposed of as general waste rather than recycled through a circular value chain. I encourage you to read the report and welcome any feedback you have. I am sure that together we can establish a new direction in the way Singapore uses and manage its plastic waste. Taking the study results forward, SEC plans to roll out a two-phased strategy. In its first phase, SEC’s campaign calls on every individual in Singapore to reduce plastic waste by using one less plastic item per day. Additionally, we will focus on recycling through educating consumers on This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 4 why, what and how to recycle plastics. In the second phase, SEC will facilitate industry stakeholder engagement among the 3P sectors to create a closed-loop ecosystem for plastic recycling that will give purpose to plastic afterlife for a circular economy. We look forward to working with businesses, schools, communities and government agencies to drive towards a zero-waste nation. The work of SEC is an ongoing one and we are grateful for the contributions of our partners, with whom we are working together to foster lasting environmental values among people in Singapore. Every little change can make a big impact.

This has been supplemented by added concern on the low recycling rates in Singapore. A recent study conducted by SEC looked at the plastic ecosystem and plastic lifecycle in Singapore. Based on the study, the estimated number of plastic bags taken from supermarkets per year alone is 820 million1. The study suggested that 2 to 4 plastic bags are taken from supermarkets per person per trip in Singapore. Figure 1: Plastic Resource Ecosystem in Singapore The study was the first to determine the plastic disposables and PET bottle usage in Singapore. Based on the study, the estimated number of polypropylene (PP) items (plastic disposables) used per year is at least 473 million2 and the estimated number of PET bottles used per year 1 Estimated figure based on survey findings and this is linearly scaled using Singapore’s population aged 20 and above (mid-year estimate 2017 which is obtained from Department of Statistics Singapore), which is the closest available demographic profiles of the survey respondents 2 Estimated figure based on survey findings and this is linearly scaled using Singapore’s population aged 20 and above (mid-year estimate 2017 which is obtained from Department of Statistics Singapore), which is the closest available demographic profiles of the survey respondents This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 6 is at least 467 million3. This suggests that a person in Singapore uses at least 1 to 3 PP items per week and at least 1 to 3 PET bottles per week. The study was supported by a literature review of past studies relating to plastic use, after-use and disposal in Singapore and other countries; quantitative research through online surveys; and qualitative research through deep-dive interviews with selected stakeholders. Data on consumer consumption patterns, plastic use behaviour, and disposal was collected using an online survey of 1,003 respondents based in Singapore. Key findings of the study showed the diverging views of introducing a financial penalty for the use of plastic bags. The results revealed that 25.92% ranked the introduction of financial penalties on plastic bags as their preferred recommendation. However, a higher proportion (28.32%) of respondents ranked the introduction of financial penalties on plastic bags as their least preferred option. Other key findings of the study showed that Singapore’s low recycling rates could be attributed, in part, to low awareness of the type of plastics that can be recycled. The study suggested that close to 70% of the survey respondents are not fully aware on what can be recycled in Singapore, and 45% of the survey respondents find it most useful to obtain information regarding the types of plastics that can be recycled in Singapore. The study found that recycling rates might be enhanced by strengthening downstream recycling efforts and supporting markets within Singapore that demand recycled plastic. The study also reiterated the results of SEC’s 2013 Plastic Bag study, when evaluating the after-use patterns of plastic bags. A high percentage of respondents (67%) indicated that bagging and disposing of general waste in a plastic bag is the most likely after-use pattern. 3 Estimated figure based on survey findings and this is linearly scaled using Singapore’s population aged 20 and above (mid-year estimate 2017 which is obtained from Department of Statistics Singapore), which is the closest available demographic profiles of the survey respondents This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 7 This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 8 Based on the literature review on best practices globally alongside feedback provided by diverse group of stakeholders through surveys and interviews, the study provides the following recommendations to help improve Singapore’s plastic ecosystem: 1. Raising awareness through effective campaigns that focus on recyclables and eliminating single-use plastics Campaigns can focus on types of recyclable plastics, method of recycling and preparation steps required for recyclables being recycled. Similarly, campaigns on awareness on types of single-use plastics and its non-recyclability can be implemented nation-wide. 2. Standardisation of Recycling Bins in Singapore It is suggested to have necessary augmentations to the bin design, colour and location, which trigger intuitive recycling behaviour, especially for commercial areas. 3. Downstream Recycling Efforts in Singapore Downstream recycling efforts can supplement upstream recycling efforts to make the recycling system in Singapore more robust. Recyclable material sorting can be practiced at the waste-to-energy facilities downstream to divert general waste and recyclable materials and achieve 100% recycling in Singapore. This would require upgrading the current waste-to-energy plants in Singapore to introduce an Integrated Waste Management System, which includes recycling on-site. Countries in the middle-east have already implemented such integrated waste management system that treats mixed domestic solid waste. 4. Innovation to Reduce Plastic Packaging Waste Public sector organisations and NGOs could partner with major packaging waste industries, such as food and beverage and consumer goods, to reduce plastic packaging of their products. 5. Building a Market for Recycled Plastic through Innovation To support the upstream and downstream recycling efforts, government and public sector organisations could step-in to support existing markets in Singapore that are manufacturing recycled plastic pellets. Recycled plastic can be used to support the major manufacturing segments in Singapore, particularly the biomedical manufacturing, electronics and general manufacturing industries, to achieve a closed loop circular economy in Singapore. For example, several start-up companies around the world are devising machines to produce plastic filaments to be used for 3D printing machines. Singapore’s plastic waste stream could be directed towards recycling plastics to feed the biomedical companies for 3D printing of devices such as prosthetics. Similarly, recycled plastics can be used for manufacturing flat-panel displays and ink and toner cartridges for the electronics manufacturing segment in Singapore. Artificial intelligence systems can be designed to support the waste management sector in Singapore. Research has also led to the use of pyrolysis technology to convert plastics to oil and fuel. Singapore could leverage on driving the use of such innovation to feed the chemical manufacturing segment (petrochemical and petroleum segments) in Singapore. The supply of rPET (recycled This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 9 PET) to general manufacturing industries in Singapore could further aid the recycled plastics market. 6. Replace Single-Use Plastic Bags/Rolls with Alternatives Public sector organisations and NGOs could partner with major privately owned supermarkets in Singapore to replace plastic bag rolls for vegetables and fruits with effective alternatives, such as reusable bags made from super light, durable nylon or reusable organic cotton muslin bags. The same initiative could be taken for bakeries across Singapore where consumers are encouraged to bring their own reusable containers when purchasing bread from bakeries instead of using the small non-reusable plastic bags provided. 7. Legislation and Policy Measures A formal legislation might be required to increase the recycling rate from 6%. To do so, a multi-prong approach could be required. We note that mandatory reporting of packaging data and packaging waste reduction plans will be implemented in 2020. In addition, a policy with a focus on step-wise reduction of single-use plastics, such as the small plastic bags obtained at bakeries, plastic packaging of vegetables and fruits at supermarkets, and plastic bag rolls to collect and weigh the fruits and vegetables. Mandating compulsory recycling at commercial facilities may also improve the recycling rates in Singapore. To transition the plastic lifecycle in Singapore from a linear to a circular economy requires a coordinated effort. A more robust, innovative and disruptive system for managing plastic waste in Singapore is needed with an emphasis on the 2M – Mitigation and Management, including mitigating the use of those single-use plastics that are generally not re-used by consumers, and better management of domestic plastic waste generated.

INTRODUCTION 1.1. Background In 2013, Singapore Environmental Council (SEC) conducted an industry-leading study aimed at evaluating patterns of plastic bag use in Singapore. The position paper titled ‘Identifying and Mitigating the Wastage and Inefficient use of Plastic Bags in Singapore’ (Singapore Environment Council, 2013) presented the findings from the study alongside targeted recommendations for at policy makers, retailers, educators, and members of the public. Since the release of the position paper, several efforts have been carried out to reduce dependency on plastic bag use and increase awareness of the impact of plastic waste on the environment. Despite the efforts, plastic waste has again risen to the forefront of the environmental agenda in Singapore. To provide a deeper analysis of the plastic ecosystem, this position paper seeks to explore a wider scope of the plastic ecosystem in Singapore 1.2. Objective of Position Paper The objectives of this study are:  Understand the factors influencing the domestic plastic consumption and waste production in Singapore  Assess the plastic consumption pattern of consumers, shopping behaviour of consumers, and the factors that influence plastic consumption  Assess the after-use pattern of plastic  Understand the reasons for the stagnation of plastic waste recycling rates between 6% and 13% since 2003, in Singapore (National Environment Agency, 2018) 1.3. Outline This report has been developed by a literature review (detailed in Section 2), as well as a collection of quantitative and qualitative data through surveys and stakeholder interviews respectively, detailed in Section 3. The scope of the report includes understanding consumption and after-use patterns of consumers for the following type of plastics:  LDPE (Low Density Polyethylene) - particularly focusing on bags obtained from supermarkets  PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) plastics - particularly focusing on bottles  PP (Polypropylene) plastics - particularly focusing on disposable food containers  HDPE (High-density polyethylene) plastics – particularly focusing on common household bottles Quantitative research through online surveys was conducted to understand the factors that influence plastic consumption and after-use pattern of consumers. The research was also to This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 14 understand the reasons for the stagnation of plastic recycling among consumers and provide recommendations to improve initiatives on plastic recycling. A survey sample size of 1,003 respondents based in Singapore has been considered for this study. Qualitative research through an in-depth interview with 10 key stakeholders was conducted to gain insights on the plastic consumption and waste scene in Singapore, and to understand the challenges and opportunities to improve initiatives on plastics recycling in Singapore. Interviews were conducted from November 2017 to May 2018.

Global Studies Literature Review Plastic production has surged over the past 50 years, from 15 million tonnes in 1964 to 311 million tonnes in 2014, and is expected to double again over the next 20 years (World Economic Forum, 2016). Annual plastic production has grown at a rate of about 8.60 (PlasticsEurope, 2016) from 1950 to 2016. It is estimated that the manufacturing of plastics consumes the same amount of fossil fuel as the entire aviation industry (Tan E. , 2018). Out of the estimated 335 million tonnes of plastic produced in 2016 (PlasticsEurope, 2017), only 9% of the plastics are recycled (Parker, 2017), with a vast majority (79%) accumulating in landfills or sloughing off in the natural environment as litter. There are more than 30 types of materials that come under the family of plastics, which are made into thousands of different types of products depending on use (PlasticsEurope, 2017). The packaging industry, in particular, has been found to be highly dependent on plastic. The main cause for the increase in plastic production is plastic packaging. Between 2000 and 2015, the share of plastic packaging as a share of global packaging volume increased from 17% to 25% (World Economic Forum, 2016). Plastic packaging includes but is not limited to PET bottles such as water and soft drinks, HDPE bottles such as shampoo, milk and detergent bottles, LDPE plastic bags such as rubbish bags, and PP plastics such as disposable food containers. The packaging volumes by 2050 are expected to quadruple to 318 million tonnes annually which is more than the entire plastic industry today (World Economic Forum, 2016). Global plastic bottle consumption alone is staggering. An article (Laville & Taylor, 2017) in the Guardian stated that the annual consumption of plastic bottles is set to top half a trillion by 2021, with a million plastic bottles being bought around the world every minute. A range of countries, as diverse as Hong Kong, Portugal, Australia and China have implemented regulation to curb the use of plastic. Notable research has been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of different initiatives to impact the use, re-use, and disposal of plastic, with the majority of research focusing on plastic bags. More than 40 countries across the globe have plastic bag bans or taxes in place, including countries across Europe, North America, Asia and Africa (Tan E. , 2018). A study (Legislative Council Panel on Environmental Affairs, 2007) conducted in Hong Kong compared the various legislative measures adopted in different countries to reduce plastic bags consumption and the results achieved. The results revealed that consumer penalties introduced at the retail level were the most effective. Such results are clearly illustrated in Ireland, where plastic bag usage dropped by more than 90% after the introduction of consumer levies. However, some studies have criticised the introduction of consumer levies on plastic bags. For instance, a study (Martinho, Balaia, & Pires, 2017) conducted on the effect of plastic bag tax in Portugal, revealed a 74% reduction in plastic bag consumption and a 61% increase in reusable plastic bags after tax implementation. The study found that as the tax implementation increased, the demand for plastic bin bags increased by 12%. An Australian-based study has also criticised the consumer levies approach for failing to recognise how plastic bags are This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 16 typically re-used or re-purposed. The study found that 9 out of 10 households in Australia line their general waste bins with either plastic bags, or specific bin liners (WALGA, 2016). Similar results were obtained in 2013 from Singapore (Singapore Environment Council, 2013). Similar studies evaluating plastic bag use and storage behaviours have also been conducted in China. One study (Zhu, 2011) found that 71.80% of consumers reported accepting a plastic bag from a retailer if it is free regardless of whether they required a bag, while 23.90% would only use plastic shopping bag if the purchased quantity necessitated it. In places like San Francisco, the ban on plastic bags in 2005 was met with objection from the trade and instead the City Government signed a voluntary agreement with major supermarkets to reduce 10 million plastic bags, which was not met within the target year (Legislative Council Panel on Environmental Affairs, 2007). Studies have also attempted to find out what consumers do with plastic bags after use. The SEC 2013 Position Paper (Singapore Environment Council, 2013) revealed that more than 40% of respondents stored plastic bags, whereas only 8.5% recycled the bags. Similarly, a study (WRAP, 2014) conducted in Hong Kong revealed that the plastic bags are frequently stored out of habit. The research found that consumers typically reuse the bags as bin liners, while others stored the bags to be reused at a later point. The study found that despite consumer intentions to bring their own plastic bags whilst shopping, many forgot to bring them or required their use due to unplanned shopping trips. Significant research has been conducted into consumer use, reuse and disposal patterns. A study (Sharp, Hoj, & Wheeler, 2010) conducted in Australia found that consumer behaviours were more influenced by financial penalties, i.e., through a plastic bag levy, rather than financial incentives, i.e., discount. It follows that information and awareness is not enough to influence consumer behaviour. Conversely, a study in Canada found that financial incentives and penalties introduced to curb plastic use only effective at enhancing existing behaviours but ineffective in stimulating behavioural change. For instance, consumers who were already practising it but did not have any impact on those who were not. Factors influencing recycling habits such as time constraints, communication, and social influence have also been studied to understand consumer behaviour. Whilst convenience and cost of recycling were found to be the primary determinant of consumer behaviour, time commitment was also found to be a significant factor (Shakil Ahmed, Ahmed Bazmi, Waheed Bhutto, Shahzadi, & Bukhari, 2014). A Singapore-based study (Ho, Liao, & Rosenthal, 2014) found that for adult Singaporeans, attitude, media dependency, traditional media attention, and interpersonal communication were positively associated with purchasing ecologically safer consumer products and environmental civic engagement. In a Hong Kong based study (Wan, Shen, & Choi, 2017), the key findings showed that subjective norm, the perception of social pressure from important others, plays a crucial role in motivating one to recycle and is likely to motivate one who possesses limited knowledge on recycling benefits to practise recycling. These studies highlight the importance of understanding the specific cultural factors that may motivate and influence consumer behaviour. This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 17 Consumer awareness of the environmental benefits of recycling does not always correspond to recycling behaviours. A study (Kolbe, 2015) found that even though the knowledge of the environmental benefits of recycling was high among German students, their participation in recycling behaviour is low. However, a Singapore-based study (Ministry of Environment and Water Resources, 2013) found that consumers commonly reported that they wanted to know more about recycling, including how to recycle, the location of recycling bins, and the benefits of recycling. The same study also reported that consumers expressed a desire for improved accessibility of recycling infrastructure in Singapore. The Singapore government has sought to enhance the recycling infrastructure by introducing recycling chutes in all new public housing projects (National Environment Agency, 2017). The global recycling industry has undergone notable disruption in recent years. While the global plastic production has skyrocketed, the annual volume of globally traded waste plastic was less than 5% weight of the new plastics production in 2012 (Velis, 2014). China has long been the primary importer of used plastics, with recent estimates suggesting that the country receives 56% (by weight) of the global imports of waste plastics (Velis, 2014). However, in 2017, China notified the World Trade Organisation (WTO) that it would stop the import of used plastic and paper to reduce the imports of contaminated materials into the country. Despite this, the industry demand for recycled plastics looks promising. With the Chinese import ban, the prices for recycled plastics have risen as compared to virgin plastics. This has stimulated industry demand for recycled plastics (Chasan, 2017). According to a recent study, the recycled plastic market is to reach USD 30 billion by 2025 (Persistence Market Research , 2017), with demand for recycled HDPE and PET plastics holding the largest market share. Prominent food and beverage, and consumer and retailer companies are also contributing to this demand, as they seek to pioneer new technologies and better integrate recycled plastics into their products. Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), a policy approach that shifts the cost of managing post-use products, either partially or fully, from local governments to the producers of those products is growing. EPR is practised by many countries as a way of streamlining and managing the plastic waste collection process. Some EPR laws require producers to physically manage their products at end-of-life as well (SAIC, 2012). EPR is implemented by countries like Germany to reduce the plastic consumption and increase the overall recycling rate. The success of these policies is debatable. A study (SAIC, 2012) compared U.S. states with and without EPR laws and found that EPR can achieve high recycling rate at a reasonable cost. The study found that consumers do not mind paying the extra cost, as they would end up paying for it as hidden cost either of the product or as part of the EPR utility bill. This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 18 2.2. Good Recycling Practices in Some Countries Several countries have taken comprehensive measures to manage their plastic waste, through recycling. Leading practice across Europe typically combines government regulation with innovative private sector recycling services. The European Union (EU) has established a waste recycling target of 50% by 2020, however, Germany has set an ambitious target of achieving almost complete (100%) waste recycling by 2020. Germany was leading the recycling race in the world in 2016 with a domestic recycling rate of 65%. Germany’s success has been linked, in part, to successful coordination between government regulation, and collaboration with the private sector. A recent paper (Hartmann & Žmak, 2017) highlighted the success of “Green Dot” and the dual system of packaging recycling in Germany. The “Green Dot” system, introduced in Germany, is an industry-funded system of waste collection, which is operated by Duales System Deutschland GmbH (“DSD”, English for German Dual System). The system liberates retailers and firms from individual take-back and recovery obligations under the German Packaging Ordinance. Companies that participate in the system, pay for disposal of the plastic items they manufacture, beforehand and are eligible to have a “Green Dot” logo on their plastic packaging. Under this system, private households are given a yellow bag in which they can put every packaging. These are collected by DSD-operated waste collection vehicles, which will sort and recycle the wastes accordingly. Germany has also introduced the largest plastic bottle deposit system (Hartmann & Žmak, 2017) which was introduced in 2006. Under this system, every shop with more than 200m2 shop area is obliged to take back every drink packages sold of the same material. The recycling-rate of PET bottles with the deposit in Germany was 97.20% in 2017 (Hartmann & Žmak, 2017). Germany presents a unique case, as efforts to address recycling rates have been sustained for many years. It may not be possible to replicate these efforts exactly for smaller recycling markets such as Singapore. Austria has also been successful in managing plastic waste by achieving high recycling rates. The ARA (Altstoff Recycling Austria AG), set up in 1993, is used to collect and recycle packaging waste from households. The ARA System was established to handle the management of the packaging waste resulting from packaging production and retail industry operations. ARA system runs a nation-wide collection and recovery system for packaging from households and businesses. There are two household collection schemes implemented across Austria, depending on the region. ARA system sorts recyclables from non-recyclables. The non-recyclable materials are then used for energy recovery (Plastic ZERO, 2012). In the Asia-Pacific context, Taiwan’s 4-in-1 recycling programme is often cited as leading best practice. The system involves coordinated recycling efforts between consumers, recycling industries, local authorities, and recycling fund. Consumers are mandated to deposit their segregated waste at local collection points. Recycling industries buy the waste material in order to recover commodities and generate revenue. Local authorities organise municipal collection teams to collect waste from collection sites. The recycling fund is the most important aspect This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 19 of the system. Manufacturers and importers of new regulated recyclable waste are required to pay a fee to the Environmental Protection Administration Taiwan (EPAT) that contribute to the recycling fund. This is distributed to trust funds and special income funds that are used to subsidise private collectors and recycling enterprises (EPA Website, 2012). A commonality between many leading practices has been the integration of EPR, including collaboration and coordination of recycling efforts between governments, consumers, producers and the recycling industry. The EPR approach encourages a shared responsibility and accountability for plastic waste recycling between all parties. 2.3. Plastic Waste Landscape in Singapore Singapore has been in the forefront in implementing various initiatives to manage the waste generated within the country. This includes building waste-to-energy plants, with the objective of reducing the volume of solid waste generated in the country. The government has also invested heavily in waste management infrastructure over recent years. Despite these efforts, the amount of waste generated has also substantially increased. The amount of waste sent for disposal rose from 1,260 tonnes per day in 1970 to 8,443 tonnes per day in 2017 (National Environment Agency, 2018), with plastic waste contributing a significant amount to this volume. In 2017, close to 815,200 tonnes of plastic waste has been generated (National Environment Agency, 2018). This number is likely to have risen. A study in 2016 showed the increasing consumption of bottled water in Singapore (SGD 134 million industry), which has also led to the increasing use of PET and disposable plastic as most of the bottled water come in plastic packaging (Lim, 2016). Singapore’s supermarket chains were in talks in 2017 to introduce a voluntary charge on plastic bags, which was scheduled to commence in 2018. However, the decision was not taken as the supermarket chains were also concerned about the impact of the levy on low-income households and the long-term effectiveness of the levy (Ng, 2017). In 2018, Dr Amy Khor, the Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources announced that the ministry would not be implementing a mandatory plastic bag levy (Boh & Tan, 2018) One of the reasons was due to plastic bags being used for the responsible and hygienic bagging of waste in Singapore. A more sustainable approach, as mentioned by the Senior Minister of State, was to tackle the excessive consumption of plastic disposables in Singapore. Recently, NEA announced that it will be implementing mandatory packaging reporting requirements in 2020. Businesses that place packaging (including plastic bags) on the consumer market, will be required to report annually on the types and amounts of packaging materials they are placing on the market and their packaging waste reduction plans. This aims to bring greater awareness to companies on the potential for waste reduction within their business operations, and spur them to take action to reduce the amount of packaging used and packaging waste disposed of. Moving forward NEA is studying the feasibility of having an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) Framework to manage plastic and packaging waste. Efforts to curb the use of plastic should be informed by how consumers are using plastic, and determining the type of plastic that can be reduced or recycled versus the type of plastic that This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 20 should be eliminated completely. For instance, consumers typically use a supermarket plastic bag for 30 minutes, whilst a plastic straw is used for five minutes. Other types of short-lived plastics include plastic stirrers, which have a lifespan of 10 seconds. Single-use plastics provide a few extra minutes of convenience but are disposed of after use. Most plastic straws, lids, cups, and stirrers fall into this category. Single-use plastic packaging is also a growing concern in Singapore. In Singapore, packaging makes up a third of domestic waste (Tan E. , 2018). Unlike countries such as South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong that have EPR or related legislation for packaging waste, Singapore does not hold businesses accountable for the plastics they introduce to the market. It is estimated that 95% of plastics, having a value of USD 120 billion (SGD157 billion), is discarded after their first use. Plastics hold a high economic value and effective recycling ensures we do not lose its value (Tan E. , 2018). However, in Singapore, the recycling rate of plastics dropped from 11% in 2013 to 6% in 2017, (National Environment Agency, 2018). Despite the rapid expansion in plastic consumption in Singapore, recycling rates are stagnant, fluctuating between 6% and 13% in the last 15 years. A significant proportion of Singapore’s recycled plastics are exported to China. For instance, in 2011 Singapore contributed 7.60% of ASEAN’s plastic export to China (Velis, 2014). However, China’s announcement that it intended to ban some imports of waste and recycling will likely disrupt Singapore’s plastic waste exports. It is still unclear as to what extent Singapore’s plastic waste exports to China will be affected. Nonetheless, there has also been constant efforts urging the government and supermarkets in Singapore to take action over plastic waste and plastic bags respectively. Several groups in Singapore have implemented various programs to bring awareness to the people regarding the environmental effects of plastic use, in order for people to reduce their dependency on plastics and to encourage recycling. These programmes have been implemented as early as 2001 where NEA introduced the National Recycling Programme where Public Waste Collectors (PWCs) licenced by NEA are required to provide recycling bins and recycling collection services. The myENV mobile application introduced by the NEA has detailed information on the recycling bins and collection services. Various organisations in Singapore have also contributed to plastic waste reduction, re-use, and recycling efforts by running campaigns to educate consumers on the type of plastics to recycle. Some groups have also held waste collection drives to collect plastics for recycling. These efforts have, to some extent, brought awareness of people towards the environmental implications of plastic use. Various initiatives have been trailed in Singapore in recent years in an effort to promote plastic recycling and re-use rates. From late 2017 to early 2018, Reverse Vending Machines have been installed in a few supermarkets around Singapore, that lets consumers exchange bottles and cans for vouchers. The initiative is a result of a collaboration between a food and beverage company and a supermarket chain in Singapore. Though the machine costs between SGD 10,000 and SGD 100,000, the pilot test with these machines revealed that 50,000 bottles were collected within three months (Charles, 2018). Similarly, in 2018, Singapore’s first zero-waste grocery store was opened. The store sells goods without any packaging and encourages customers to re-use containers (Hicks, 2018). This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 21 Many government initiatives have been undertaken for recycling as well. One such is NEA’s 3R fund that particularly focusses on increasing the recycling rate in Singapore by co-funding up to 80% of the qualifying cost of the recycling technology, which is subject to a cap of SGD 1 million per project. The fund aims to help organisations - including companies, non-profit organisations, town council, schools, institutions and managing bodies - overcome the start-up cost for recycling facilities, and offset part of the technological cost in order to increase recycling in Singapore (National Environment Agency, 2018). Environment Technology Research Programme (ETRP) is another SGD 21 million funding programme by NEA. It aims to enhance the technological competencies and support companies and researchers in waste management research. They focus on projects in waste management, such as those related to energy recovery, materials recovery and special waste treatment (Green Future Solutions, 2015). However, the lack of market demand for such recyclable products poses the real problem. In order to make the system profitable, there needs to be a market for recycled goods within Singapore. Therefore, in spite of such funding provided by the government in Singapore, there is a lack of investment in recycling technologies by waste management companies. The effect of these problems are not just felt in Singapore, but also can be seen in the global recycling market (Davis, 2015). These constraints highlight the some of the constraints with implementing a market-driven model where the market size and profit opportunities are more limited. Singapore’s plastic recycling ecosystem is closely interlinked with the global recycling ecosystem, particularly due to its current dependence on plastic exports to China. To better understand Singapore’s plastic lifecycle, it is necessary to gain a deep understanding of the factors that influence plastic use, after-use, and disposal. 2.4. Conclusion on Literature Review The literature review highlighted the scale and growth of plastic consumption, globally and in Singapore. These trends have had the result of increasing plastic waste in Singapore. The literature review explored the different initiatives designed to curb plastic consumption, and encourage more responsible after-use and disposal of plastic waste. The majority of initiatives designed to curb plastic waste have focused on plastic bags. Levy and bans have proved effective in some countries but resulted in increased plastic consumption in others. In Singapore, a levy placed on plastic bags has been met with significant rejection from the consumers and the government, as studies have shown that consumers are regularly re-using plastic bags to line garbage bins and dispose of general waste. Placing a ban on plastic bags would also raise objections in Singapore for the same reason. Rather, Singapore can have a greater impact by focusing on reducing the consumption of plastics that are typically not re-used by consumers for other purposes. Single-use plastics (such as PET bottles, Styrofoam containers, and non-reusable plastic bags) are of great concern in Singapore, due to their high consumption rates, low re-use rates, and the inability of the plastics to be recycled. The literature further shows that there are various factors influencing recycling habits – such as time, awareness and cost. Access to recycling bins and convenience has been highlighted in some studies as some eminent factors that influence recycling in Singapore. Behavioural This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 22 habit is considered to be another factor. However, various organisations in Singapore have implemented various campaigns and initiatives, and yet plastic recycling rates are low and stagnating. This shows that there are deeper factors affecting recycling which need to be explored. One such factor can be attributed to the demand for recycled products created by the recycled plastics market. Since Singapore is not a manufacturing hub of plastics, the recycling industry in Singapore is relatively underdeveloped, with the majority of sorted recyclables being exported for recycling. Without an established market, the demand for recycled plastic is low, thus limiting the demand. This can be considered a barrier to Singapore developing a circular economy. As such, there is an opportunity for industries within Singapore that rely on plastic waste to create a demand for recycled products. EPR was also identified as an effective method for supporting the transition from a linear to a circular plastic waste economy. In Singapore, there is currently no mandate on recycling or take-back. As such, a comprehensive review of existing and potential government and industry initiatives and incentives is required to evaluate what action could be taken to support increase re-use and recycling. From the literature review, it can be concluded that the involvement of all stakeholders in the plastic ecosystem is essential to create a circular and robust recycling model in Singapore.

Design and Methodology The empirical research was conducted using online surveys and in-person interviews. The online survey comprises open and closed questionnaire questions. The online survey was conducted to understand the demographic profiling of participants, their plastic use, after-use, and disposal behaviour. The online survey also sought to evaluate the level of knowledge survey respondents had in relation plastic recycling, and gather recommendations on how the plastic consumption and recycling practices in Singapore can be improved. The survey went through numerous iterations and was piloted on a test population prior to roll out. The test population were asked to complete a Pilot Test Feedback Form to guide further survey enhancements. The final survey comprises 17 questions, with the estimated completion time of 15 minutes. The survey questions can be found in Appendix A. Based on Singapore total population of 5.6 million4, a 95% confidence level with 3% margin of error would require a sample size of about 1,000. The survey was rolled-out using Qualtrics, an online survey tool to target 1,000 respondent based in Singapore with a demographic profile listed in Table 1. An online survey was selected as a survey approach for practical reason as Singapore is incredibly digitally included5 and there is no established theory relating digital inclusion to recycling behaviour in Singapore. The online survey was live for six months, from December 2017 to May 2018. 4 Singapore total population is 5,612,300 (mid-year estimate 2017 which is obtained from Department of Statistics Singapore) 5 There is 82% penetration in terms of internet users in Singapore, according to the report “Digital in 2017” by Hootsuite and We Are Social. This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 24 3.2. Demographic Profile of Survey Respondents A total of 1,003 completed surveys were obtained and analysed for this report.

Findings from Surveys The online survey was structured around five primary themes: 1. Plastic Usage Habits of respondents for:  LDPE or low-density polyethylene (especially plastic bags)  PP or polypropylene (especially disposables)  PET or polyethylene terephthalate (especially bottles) 2. Post use (after-use) pattern of respondents for:  LDPE (especially plastic bags)  PP (especially disposables)  PET (especially bottles)  HDPE or high-density polyethylene (especially common household bottles) 3. Reasons for the stagnation of recycling rates in Singapore 4. Recommendation to reduce plastic consumption and improve recycling rates in Singapore 3.3.1. Plastic Usage Habits of Respondents 3.3.1.1. Plastic Bags From Supermarkets Respondents were asked to indicate their plastic bag usage per shopping trip to the supermarket. More than 68% of the respondents indicated that they take between 1 to 5 plastic bags per shopping trip at the supermarket. Conversely, 15.15% of the respondents indicated they bring their own bags for shopping, while 13.56% of respondents indicated they take 6 or more bags per shopping trip. Only 2.99% of the respondents indicated that the question is not applicable to their shopping patterns, as they do not shop at the supermarket. Respondents were also asked to indicate whether they request for separate bags to hold their wet and dry items at the supermarket. The results reveal that 53.54% of respondents do not request separate bags, however, 36.39% of respondents do request separate bags. 10.07% of the respondents indicated that the question is not applicable. This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 26 Figure 2: How many plastic bags do you take from the supermarket per shopping trip? Based on the results, it is estimated that consumers in Singapore take 820 million6 plastic bags from supermarkets each year. The study suggests that 2 to 4 plastic bags are taken from supermarkets per person per trip in Singapore. Plastic Bag Use by Gender The study found that respondents who were women indicated to be twice as likely to bring a reusable bag as respondents who were men (18% versus 10%). Figure 3: Plastic Bag use by Gender Plastic Bag Use by Age Group The study found that most respondents who were above 60 years of age used 6 or more plastic bags per shopping trip as compared to respondents from other age 6 Estimated figure based on survey findings and this is linearly scaled using Singapore’s population aged 20 and above (mid-year estimate 2017 which is obtained from Department of Statistics Singapore), which is the closest available demographic profiles of the survey respondents 33.20% 35.09% 13.56% 15.15% 2.99% 1 - 2 plastic bags 3 - 5 plastic bags 6 or more plastic bags I always bring my own bag Not applicable 31.80% 34.49% 13.13% 18.20% 2.37% 35.58% 36.12% 14.29% 9.97% 4.04% 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 1 - 2 plastic bags 3 - 5 plastic bags 6 or more plastic bags I always bring my own bag N/A (eg. do not shop) Female Male Percentage of Respondents This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 27 groups. Similarly, the least number of respondents who were above 60 years of age bring their own bags to the supermarket as compared to other age groups. Figure 4: Plastic Bag use by Age 3.3.1.2. PET Bottle Usage Respondents were asked to indicate the number of PET bottles they used per week. The results reveal that 57.93% respondents use 0 to 1 PET bottles per week, whereas 2.99% of respondents indicated they use more than 7 PET bottles per week. Figure 5: How many PET bottles do you use per week? 35.05% 33.33% 10.65% 14.43% 6.53% 37.20% 35.85% 9.70% 15.90% 1.35% 26.18% 36.36% 19.27% 17.09% 1.09% 31.82% 33.33% 24.24% 6.06% 4.55% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 1 - 2 plastic bags 3 - 5 plastic bags 6 or more plastic bags I always bring my own bag Not applicable 15 - 25 26 - 40 41 - 60 Above 60 Percentage of Respondents 57.93% 33.20% 5.88% 2.99% 0 - 1 2-4 5-7 More than 7 This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 28 Based on the results, it is estimated that consumers in Singapore use 467 million7 PET bottles each year, with 1 to 3 PET bottles used per person per week. 3.3.1.3. PP Plastic Usage Similar results were obtained when respondents were asked to indicate the number of PP items they purchased per week. The results reveal that 58.82% of respondents purchase 0 to 1 PP items per week, whereas 6.68% indicated they purchase 5 to 7 PP plastic items per week. Only 3.49% indicated to use more than 7 PP Plastic items per week. Figure 6: How many PP items do you purchase per week? Based on the results, it is estimated that consumers in Singapore purchase 473 million8 PP items (disposables) each year, with 1 to 3 plastic disposable item used per person per week. 3.3.2. Plastic After-Use Habits Of Respondents Review of literature shows that there are various trends of after-use habits of plastic by people all around the world. In Singapore, various plastics are seen to be after-used differently. With plastic bags, the common after-use pattern is to use it to bag and dispose of general waste. With PET bottles, most people have indicated to recycle PET bottles as the most common after-use pattern. For PP Items, it is re-used and for HDPE bottles, most people have indicated that the most likely after-use pattern is disposal in the garbage bin. 3.3.2.1. Plastic Bag After-Use Patterns Respondents were asked to rank which action they were likely to take immediately after bringing home plastic bags from the supermarket. The survey provided five 7 Estimated figure based on survey findings and this is linearly scaled using Singapore’s population aged 20 and above (mid-year estimate 2017 which is obtained from Department of Statistics Singapore), which is the closest available demographic profiles of the survey respondents 8 Estimated figure based on survey findings and this is linearly scaled using Singapore’s population aged 20 and above (mid-year estimate 2017 which is obtained from Department of Statistics Singapore), which is the closest available demographic profiles of the survey respondents 58.82% 31.01% 6.68% 3.49% 0 - 1 2-4 5-7 More than 7 This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 29 options, with one being the most likely action, and five being the least likely action. The following action options were presented to respondents:  Use them to bag and dispose of general waste  Store them  Reuse plastic bag  Dispose of in the garbage bin  Recycle The majority of respondents, 67%, ranked ‘use them to bag and dispose of general waste’ as rank their most likely option. Majority of respondents ranked ‘store them’ as their second most likely option (44.37%). The least likely action recorded by respondents (51.84%) was ‘dispose them in garbage bins’. Figure 7: Most likely action (rank 1) to least likely action (rank 5) taken by respondents immediately after bringing plastic bags home from the supermarket Respondents indicated a variety of reasons for storing and reusing plastic bags. Examples include: Plastic bags are stored and/or reused for –  Storing food  Storing clothes  Future disposal of general waste 67.00% 18.54% 12.06% 11.37% 44.37% 33.60% 7.68% 17.85% 25.52% 36.89% 15.85% 3.89% 4.99% 7.28% 34.30% 51.84% 6.58% 10.17% 40.28% 40.78% 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 1 2 3 4 5 Use them to bag and dispose of general waste Reuse Plastic Bag Store them Dispose in Garbage bin Rank Percentage of Respondents This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 30  Carrying wet items  Carrying dirty laundry  Grocery shopping, or in supermarkets  Picking dog faeces  Gift wrapping  Storing vegetables  Storing miscellaneous items 3.3.2.2. PET Bottle After-Use Pattern Respondents were asked to rank which action they were likely to take after using a PET bottle. The survey provided three options, with one being the most likely action, and three being the least likely option. The following action options were presented to respondents:  Recycle  Reuse  Dispose in garbage bin Respondents (37.09%) indicated that the most likely action would be to ‘recycle the PET bottles’ after use. This was followed by ‘reuse’ (ranked ‘2’ by 36.29% of the respondents). The least likely option indicated is ‘disposing PET bottles’ in the garbage bin (ranked ‘3’ by 42.07% of the respondents). Figure 8: Most likely action (rank 1) to least likely action (rank 3) taken by respondents after using PET bottles Respondents indicated that they reuse PET bottles for the following:  To store water  To store other liquids  For art and handicrafts 31.90% 36.29% 31.80% 31.11% 26.82% 42.07% 37.09% 36.89% 26.02% 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 1 2 3 Reuse Dispose in Garbage Bin Recycle Rank Percentage of Respondents This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 31  For gardening  Storing soap Others indicated not reusing PET bottles. 3.3.2.3. PP Items After-Use Pattern Respondents were asked to rank which action they were likely to take after using PP items. The survey provided three options, with one being the most likely action, and three being the least likely option. The following action options were presented to the respondents:  Recycle  Reuse  Dispose in garbage bin The majority of respondents (52.84%) ranked ‘reuse’ the PP item as their most likely option. Majority of respondents ranked ‘recycle’ as the second most likely option (42.07%). The least likely option recorded by the majority of respondents (47.96%) was ‘dispose in the garbage bin’. Figure 9: Most likely action (rank 1) to least likely action (rank 3) taken by respondents after using PP Items. 3.3.2.4. HDPE Plastics After-Use Pattern Respondents were asked to rank which action they were likely to take after using HDPE plastic items, particularly those such as shampoo and detergent bottles. The survey provided three options, with one being the most likely action, and three being the least likely option. The following options were presented to the respondents:  Recycle 52.84% 32.30% 14.86% 26.42% 25.62% 47.96% 20.74% 42.07% 37.19% 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 1 2 3 Reuse Dispose in Garbage Bin Recycle Rank Percentage of Respondents This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 32  Reuse  Dispose in garbage bin The majority of respondents (44.67%) ranked ‘dispose in garbage bin’ as their most likely option. Majority of respondents ranked ‘recycle’ as the second most likely option (37.29%). The least likely option recorded by most respondents (46.96%) was ‘Reuse’. Figure 10: Most likely action (rank 1) to least likely action (rank 3) taken by respondents after using HDPE plastic items Respondents were asked to indicate the various ways in which they would reuse HDPE bottles. Out of 319 respondents, 67.39% stated that they use HDPE bottles to store other liquids such as detergents, shampoos and glass cleaners. Of these respondents, 44.18% stated that they refill HDPE bottles with refillable packs. While 12.85% of respondents indicated that they would not reuse the HDPE bottle. The most commonly cited reason was the risk of toxicity of materials inside the bottle. 3.3.3. Understanding Reasons For Stagnation Of Recycling Rates In Singapore This study aims to identify the reason(s) for the low recycling rate in Singapore. The recycling rates for plastics have been from 6% to 13% in the past 15 years (National Environment Agency, 2018). There are many possible reasons for the low and stagnating rates of recycling. Reasons identified in the literature review primarily pertain to low rates of awareness on the type of plastics that can be recycled. The literature review also highlighted that infrastructure-based difficulties in recycling may also contribute to low-rates of recycling. For instance, consumers may not be familiar 17.55% 35.49% 46.96% 44.67% 27.22% 28.12% 37.79% 37.29% 24.93% 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 1 2 3 Reuse Dispose in Garbage Bin Recycle Rank Percentage of Respondents This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 33 with the recycling location or may be deterred if recycling location is not in close proximity. 3.3.3.1. Awareness On Types of Plastics That Can Be Recycled In Singapore Respondents were assessed on their knowledge on the types of plastics that can be recycled in Singapore. From a list of options, they were asked to select the types of plastics that could be recycled in Singapore. The options provided to the survey participants are listed below. Respondents could choose more than one option.  Plastic bags  Take-away containers (non-polystyrene)  Styrofoam containers  Bottled drinking water  Detergent bottles The Singapore National Environment Agency (NEA), a public organisation responsible for improving and sustaining a clean and green environment in Singapore, has published a list of the items that can and cannot be placed in the blue recycling bin, including a breakdown of plastic items (National Environment Agency, 2017). The online survey provided an example of common consumer plastic products and asked participants to indicate whether they could be recycled. The results show that only 29.21% of respondents were fully aware of the type of plastics that can be recycled (i.e. they answered all question correctly), whereas the remaining respondents only partially answered the question correctly. Table 2: Please select the types of plastics that can be recycled in Singapore Answers Number of Respondents Percentage (%) Answered all questions correctly (5/5) 293 29.21 Selected all options including ‘Styrofoam containers’ (4/5) 130 12.96 Selected 3 out of 4 correct options (3/5) 314 31.31 Selected 2 out of 4 correct options (2/5) 177 17.65 Selected 1 out of 4 correct options (1/5) 86 8.57 Answered all questions incorrectly (0) 3 0.30 3.3.3.2. Location Of Recycling Bin Respondents were asked whether they were aware of the location of their closest recycling bin. The majority of respondents (78.86%) indicated that they were aware of the location of the nearest recycling bin. However, 21.14% of respondents indicated that they were not aware of the location of their nearest recycling bin. This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 34 Of the 21.14% of respondents who were not aware of the location of their nearest recycling bin, 43.40% have indicated living in Condominiums/Apartments, followed by 41.04% living in HDBs (41.04%), and 14.62% living in landed properties. Based on the survey response, more than 50% of the respondents who indicated that they were not aware of the location of their nearest recycling bin live in private housing. Figure 11: Are you aware of where the nearest recycle bin is located? 3.3.3.3. Most Likely Reason Why Respondents Would Not Like To Recycle To understand some of the factors that may contribute to low recycling rates in Singapore, respondents were asked to indicate the most likely reason for why they would not recycle plastics. Five options were provided to respondents, including the option of ‘Others’ where respondents were required to manually fill in the reason for not recycling plastics. The following options were presented to respondents, and they were asked to select only one option:  Inconvenient to bring recyclables to the recycling bin  Inconvenient to separate recyclables from normal waste  Too few items to recycle  Will re-use it for other purposes instead of recycling  Others The majority of respondents (35.59%) selected the option, ‘Will re-use it for other purposes instead of recycling’. This was followed by ‘Others’ (21.64%). Under this option, respondents indicated a broad number of reasons. The reasons were coded to support data collection. The coded data were then grouped based on the recurrence of responses, to come up with repeating data categories. Data categories are as follow: Condomi niums / Apartme nt 43.40% HDB 41.04% Landed property 14.62% Others 0.94% No 21.14% Yes 78.86% This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 35  Cannot find recycling bins/no recycling bins located nearby  Do not know what to recycle  I recycle/reuse  Inconvenient to wash and dry recyclables/inconvenient to clean the recyclables as it is contaminated  Do not believe that plastics get recycled in Singapore The results reveal that the majority of respondents who had selected the option ‘Others’, found it inconvenient to wash and dry recyclables, or to clean recyclables before disposal as it was contaminated with oil, food, etc. Second highest responses in this category were indicated by respondents (16.99% in both cases) on not knowing what to recycle and not knowing the location of the recycling bin. Figure 12: Please select the most likely reason why you would not recycle plastics 3.3.4. Recommendations The online survey sought to elicit recommendations from respondents on the actions and initiatives that could be introduced to reduce plastic usage and encourage increased rates of recycling. Respondents have indicated that they would like to see plastic being managed in an effective way through the charging of plastic items, and retailers providing incentives for bringing own bags/containers. Similarly, people have also indicated that they would like to know the type of plastics that can be recycled in Singapore and the location of the recycling bins. Overall, most respondents have indicated that the most effective way of improving the recycling rate would be to provide incentives for recycling. 21.24% 12.66% 21.64% 8.87% 35.59% Inconvenient to bring recyclables to the recycling bin Inconvenient to separate recyclables from normal waste Others Too few items to recycle Will re-use it for other purposes instead of recycling 16.99 16.99 15.53 35.92 14.56 Can't find Recycle Bin/No recycling bins located nearby Do not know what to recycle I recycle/reuse Inconvenient to wash and dry recyclables/inconvenient to clean the recyclables as it is contaminated Do not believe that plastics get recycled in Singapore This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 36 3.3.4.1. Recommendations To Reduce Unnecessary Plastic Usage Respondents were asked to rank which recommendations they felt would be effective in reducing plastic usage in Singapore. Respondents were asked to rank six recommendations, with one being the most effective recommendation and six being the least effective recommendation. The following recommendations were listed:  Reminders from cashiers on the need for plastic bag/disposal container  More efficient bagging or packaging of items  Have more campaigns and activities to increase awareness on the importance of plastic waste reduction  Retailers to provide an incentive (e.g. product discounts, shopping vouchers, membership points) when I bring my own bag/container  Implement a charge on plastic items (plastic bags, takeaway containers, cutlery etc.)  Others The results show that majority of the respondents recommend retailers to provide incentives such as product discounts, shopping vouchers and membership points, when consumers bring their own bag/container, suggesting that these actions will have the greatest impact on reducing plastic use in Singapore. The results also show that a significant proportion of respondents felt that the introduction of a financial penalty (25.92%) on the use of plastic bags, takeaway containers, cutlery etc.) would be the most effective method (ranked 1 out of 6) to reduce unnecessary plastic usage. However, 28.32% of respondents indicated that the introduction of financial penalties would be the least effective method (ranked 5 out of 6). The results reveal diverging views on how best to tackle plastic consumption through the introduction of financial penalty for taking plastic bags.

Example responses categorised under this recommendation include: Respondent 1: “Encourage manufacturer to reduce packaging” Respondent 2: “Work with large companies to not individually wrap items that are then packaged again in plastic” Respondent 3: “Reduce use of plastic as a packaging material” Respondent 4: “Related to \"more efficient bagging or packaging\" - unfortunately, we must often buy fruit and some veggies in plastic-wrapped Styrofoam! This is terrible, but in some markets, there is no \"unpackaged\" fruit such as mangos or tomatoes” Recommendation 2: Limit the availability of plastic and convenience of plastic or provide environmentally friendly alternatives Respondents recommended that greater controls could be introduced to limit the availability of plastics, particularly single-use plastics. Respondents did not indicate whether the limits should be imposed by the government or by businesses or institutions. Example responses categorised under this recommendation include: Respondent 1: This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 39 “Ban the use of disposable PP containers or bottles.” Respondent 2: “(1) initially implement a nationwide supermarket \"NO PLASTICS DAY\" with all stakeholders involved, including enough pre-enforcement publicity campaign. (2) The next stage is for all supermarkets to enforce charging of items (plastic bags, takeaway containers, cutlery, etc.)” Respondent 3: “Ban plastic straws and ban food plastic containers unless justified and necessary. Also, all retailers should be obliged by law to use biodegradable plastic bags. Ban plastic cutlery.” Respondent 4: “Do away with selling water in plastic bottles, have more water fountains” Respondent 5: “Supermarkets can take back used plastic bags from last purchase” Recommendation 3: Promote awareness and education about plastics and its use Respondents recommended that there is a need for greater education and awareness on the use of plastics in Singapore. Respondent 1: “More awareness about different types of plastics and how certain types may pose or are causing health and environment issues, and then how we can help“ Respondent 2: “Awareness at all ages, for example, screenings of the Blue Planet and then showing the daily habits of people in Singapore, e.g. Lau Pa Sat, a supposed tourist attraction for the clean and green \"Garden city”, uses ONLY disposals, Old Chang Kee uses ONE single-use plastic bag per item, daily habits of \"da-bao-ing\" tea and coffee. If awareness is raised on the need to cut down on these habits or bring their own containers (thermos flasks for drinks, food containers such as those used in the past to take away, a lot of plastic wastage can be reduced. “ Respondent 3: “Develop awareness in schools at all levels, also at all residents' n companies' activities. “ Recommendation 4: Improve the convenience of recycling facilities Respondents recommended that there is a need to increase the number of recycling bins/location and provide incentives to make recycling more convenient. Respondent 1: “Invest in recycling bins (one for each - plastic bottles, paper, wet waste in every condo/HDB. Fine those residents who do not separate the waste!!” Respondent 2: “We really need more recycling bins in Singapore.” This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 40 3.3.4.2. Recommendations On What Respondents Would Like To Find Out Regarding Plastic Waste Recycling Respondents were asked to indicate what additional information they would like to access with regard to plastic waste recycling. They were presented with five options and asked to rank the options with one being most useful to five being least useful. The additional option of ‘Others’ was provided to encourage respondents to include additional information. The five options included:  Types of plastics to be recycled  Recycling campaigns/efforts in Singapore  Benefits of recycling  Location of recycling bin  Others The majority of respondents (45.16%) indicated that the most useful information they would like to find out was information regarding the types of plastics that can be recycled in Singapore. This was followed by the request for more information regarding the location of the recycling bin (29.01%) as the second most useful information. Figure 14: Most useful information (rank 1) to least useful information (rank 5) recommended by respondents regarding what they would like to find out about plastic waste recycling 45.16% 31.01% 18.54% 4.99% 24.63% 29.01% 22.63% 21.54% 15.65% 21.24% 33.70% 28.12% 10.97% 17.05% 23.73% 43.17% 91.13% 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 1 2 3 4 5 Type of plastics to be recycled Location of recycling bins Recycling campaigns/efforts in Singapore Benefits of recycling Others Rank Percentage of Respondents This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 41 A significant proportion of respondents (91.13%) ranked the ‘Others’ option as rank 5. Under this option, 94 respondents provided a range of additional suggestions on what they would like to find out regarding plastic waste recycling. These suggestions were coded and categorised into three main themes as given below. Table 4: Suggestions provided by respondents on what they would like to find out regarding plastic waste recycling Others Recommendation Results Recommendation 1: Provide more information on the recycled plastic lifecycle Stated by 48.93% of respondents Suggestion 2: Provide more information on how and what to recycle Stated by 30.85% of the respondents Suggestion 3: Provide more information on the environmental benefits of recycling Stated by 20.21% of respondents Suggestion 1: Provide more information on the recycled plastic lifecycle The majority of respondents that selected ‘Others’ indicated that they would like more information on the lifecycle of plastic waste after it is disposed of in the recycling bin in Singapore. Example responses include: Respondent 1: “Where our plastics, papers, metals, and other materials go to when we recycle them? Does it create an even bigger carbon footprint or does it actually alleviate and help us reduce total wastage in the system?” Respondent 2: This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 42 “Ultimate fate of the recycled plastic; gap in knowledge as people will find it difficult to link what is thrown in the recycling bin and the final recycled goods; Some illustrations will be beneficial” Respondent 3: “What happens to the recycled products? Are we really contributing?” Suggestion 2: Provide more information on how and what to recycle Respondents also indicated that they would like more information related to what types of materials can be recycled, and how they should be disposed of. Examples responses include: Respondent 1: “General education about how to recycle, e.g. do you need to clean the plastic bottles before putting into the recycling bin? Do you need to put different plastic types into separate bags? What happens if you see rubbish in the recycling bins? Why are paper, glass and other recyclables placed in the same big bin as plastics? What can the general public do to help make the job of the recycling centres easier? What happens when rainwater enters the recycling bins? What happens when cats/dogs/birds/rats or other pests defecate/dirty in the bins?” Respondent 2: “Be clear of which plastics can be recycled and have a separate bin for plastic waste” Respondent 3: “What one needs to do before putting plastics into the recycling bin (e.g., washing it)?” Suggestion 3: Provide more information on the environmental benefits of recycling Respondents also indicated that they wanted more information relating to the environmental impact of plastic waste and the environmental benefits of recycling. A small percentage of respondents also responded that they would like recycling bins to be more easily accessible, and highlighted the need for increased consistency around the country to prevent confusion. Example suggestions included: Respondent 1: “(We would like to know about) Campaigns on TV, Radio, and Online. I have not seen or heard anything on plastic recycling on these media. Schools, by Town Councils” Respondent 2: “[We would like] to have a clear/transparent plastic to show the types of item /trash to be placed inside each bin instead of covered bin. Alternatively, have a standard colour code for all bins (Green bin - paper, Yellow bin - plastic, Red bin -food waste, Brown - other trash that is oily, etc.)” 3.3.4.3. Recommendations To Encourage Plastic Waste Recycling This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 43 Respondents were asked to indicate which recommendations they felt would be most effective in encouraging plastic waste recycling in Singapore. They were presented with six options and asked to rank the options, with one being the most effective recommendation, and six being the least effective recommendation. Respondents were also given the option of selecting ‘Others’ and submitting additional recommendations on what they thought could encourage plastic waste recycling in Singapore. The six options included:  Provide incentives for recycling  Weekly or monthly training/drives on recycling in housing complex  Create awareness on the types of plastics that can be recycled and the method of recycling  Place more recycling bins around my area/make recycling bins more accessible  More media coverage on plastic waste recycling  Others The majority of respondents (38.58%) indicated that the provision of incentives for recycling is the most effective way to encourage plastic waste recycling. Respondents were asked to write what kind of incentive would be most effective to encourage recycling, according to them. Respondents suggested a broad range of incentive mechanisms, including monetary systems, point systems, cash discounts, rebates, coupons, vouchers, and discounts. Example recommendations included: Respondent 1: “Businesses that form part of the plastic consumption should be obligated to handle and receive returns of plastic by customers in a reverse cycle so that those who generate the most plastic have the most responsibility to return plastic to its generating source. E.g. Customers who buy products with plastic packaging returns plastic to the supermarkets which in turn return to wholesalers, wholesalers return to plastic selling companies. Plastic selling companies receive some level of subsidy for recycling the plastic.” Respondent 2: “Discount when taking away food in own container or coffee in own cup” Respondent 3: “HPB rewards or EZlink rewards - tag to any of the daily existing rewards platform” In addition to recommending incentives, respondents also recommended the use of awareness raising efforts, as the second most effective recommendation (rank 2). Majority 26.82% of respondents recommended that recycling rates could be improved by placing more recycling bins around the country and making recycling more accessible. This was closely followed by 26.42% of respondents who recommended that more could be done to raise awareness on the types of plastics to be recycled and the method of recycling (rank 2). This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 44 Figure 15: Most effective recommendation (rank 1) to least effective recommendation (rank 6) provided by respondents to encourage plastic waste recycling The vast majority (91.53%) of the respondents ranked the option ‘Others’ as rank 6. Respondents that selected the ‘Others’ option, provided additional recommendations on encouraging plastic recycling. Example of recommendations provided by respondents include: Respondent 1: “Label all Plastics properly by recycling 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6” Respondent 2: “Recycling practices should be extended to companies' sustainability efforts” Respondent 3: “Maintenance of recycling bins - most recycling bins are run down and broken” 13.76% 17.75% 24.53% 26.12% 16.95% 22.63% 26.82% 18.74% 19.14% 11.47% 17.15% 26.42% 23.93% 21.04% 10.57% 4.29% 11.86% 15.85% 21.14% 43.67% 38.58% 16.35% 16.05% 11.96% 14.76% 91.53% 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 1 2 3 4 5 6 More media coverage on plastic waste recycling Place more recycle bins around my area/make recycle bins more accessible Create awareness on the type of plastics that can be recycled and the method of recycling Weekly or monthly trainings/drives on recycling in housing complexes Provide incentives for Recycling Others Rank Percentage of Respondents This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 45 Respondent 4: “Reduce the use of plastic in the first place including tackling the issues previously mentioned. At the same time increase capabilities of recycling plastic and increasing the cost of single-use plastic to deter wastage” Respondent 5: “Provide easy access to separated bins e.g. Recycling bin/chute for plastic, paper and cans and a bin/chute for general waste” Respondent 6: “[Information about what consumers should] do before putting the recyclable items into the recycle bin e.g. bottles should be rinsed at least once from pretending foul smell, display how recycling can lead to lesser catastrophe in the world, best is just make the charges of the plastic containers and bottles more expensive” 3.3.5. Other Thoughts On Plastic Usage, Waste And Recycling In Singapore Respondents were also asked to comment on their thoughts regarding plastic usage, waste and recycling in Singapore. A large proportion (64%) of the respondents have responded to the question expressing their thoughts on what should and shouldn’t be done to reduce plastic usage and increase plastic recycling. Some of the respondents have expressed their personal experience regarding plastic use or recycling. Some are given below: Respondent 1: “Coming from a different country, recycling here is very confusing. I'm not sure it exists (at my condo they seem like normal trash cans and I don't really see a recycling truck or something). It's also a normal way of life. We learned about how and why to do it in elementary school, and we came home and trained our parents, and now we get in trouble if we put things in the wrong bin. It needs to be a way of life, especially here where we don't have much space, not recycling should be heavily discouraged.” Respondent 2: “Singapore has to step up as an environmental leader in Asia. Lead by being the best example of caring about the environment. Make strict laws on recycling. If there can be a fine for littering, there should certainly be a fine on not recycling.” Respondent 3: “The recycling bins found around my HDB block is always overflowing with waste of all sorts. It confuses me to see that one bin is meant for all types of recyclables (paper, aluminium, and plastics). As a result, most people don't treat the bins as a recycling bin and simply dump whatever. I hesitate the recycle because I feel like my recyclables will be contaminated and then dumped.” Respondent 4: “A lot of people do not know what types of plastic can be recycled, or that those contaminated with food cannot be recycled. It is important to create awareness This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 46 on recycling. Also to increase the numbers of recycling bins so that people can be constantly reminded to recycle instead of disposing of the plastics.” This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 47 3.4. Findings from Interviews A total of 10 stakeholders were interviewed from November 2017 to May 2018, including 6 from the academia (3 research experts and 3 school teachers), 4 were from the industry (2 from waste management business, 1 from consumer goods manufacturing company and 1 from recycling industry). Karung Guni men, or Singapore’s traditional rag-and-bone men who collect recyclables and other waste items from residences around Singapore, were also interviewed. The main objective to interview key stakeholders was to better understand the plastic scene in Singapore and the efforts taken by countries in other parts of the world. Questions were targeted to understand the plastic consumption situation in Singapore, plastic recycling practices and advancements in Singapore and the world, challenges faced by the businesses and consumers and the future of plastic consumption and waste in Singapore. 3.4.1. Industry Industry stakeholders were interviewed with the objective of a better understanding of the plastic waste ecosystem; plastic recycling trends and the challenges and opportunities associated with plastic recycling. The interviews were structured using a combination of open questions to promote discussion and analysis. A summary of the discussion is outlined below: Plastic waste ecosystem The interviews revealed insightful findings pertaining to the unique nature of Singapore’s plastic ecosystem. Interviewees explained that while Singapore produces a large amount of raw plastics, raw materials/polymers/resins, many of these plastics are exported to manufacturers outside of the country. Singapore then imports plastic packaging and consumable packaging back into the country. This finding indicates that Singapore does not have the full packaging ecosystem located within its borders. Plastic waste recycling The interviews indicated that the majority of recycled plastic waste comes from storage, distribution, retailer and catering businesses, with a more limited proportion coming from residents. Waste is organised and managed through multiple methods. There is a residential municipal waste collection and business-to-business contractors manage this waste collection. The waste collected by municipal collectors is sorted by public waste collection contractors and aggregated. Other contractors and larger aggregators sort commercial materials. Interviewees explained that there is a limited recycling of the sorted plastic waste in Singapore due to limited manufacturing demand for recycled plastic. Therefore, these aggregated materials are traded on the global market and are recycled at manufacturing locations such as Malaysia, and formerly China (before the green fence). At the municipal level, informal waste collectors, known as – ‘Karang guni’ – operate a door-to-door collection service of certain items such as newspapers, televisions, radios and This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 48 computers. Low trade value is typically usually not collected. The Karang guni collector pays the residents during collection and sells the items to a recycler. Plastic recycling challenges and opportunities One interviewee highlighted potential challenges and opportunities associated with consumers and more broadly with the waste management industry. The interviewees indicated that current rates of consumer consumption present a challenge to plastic recycling. In particular, the interviewee highlighted Singapore’s dependence and over-use of plastics by consumers. They attributed this trend to convenience, cheap supply of plastics, resistance to change, and resistance to taking personal responsibility. Opportunities and suggested recommendations to curb the use of plastics included the introduction of financial levy’s, such as a charge per bag at checkout in supermarkets, as well as financial incentives, such as the provision of discounts to people who drink coffee in reusable cups. The interview recognised that the introduction of financial penalties would likely result in resistance in the short term, but it offers and effective longer term solution to transition consumer behaviours. From an industry perspective, challenges predominantly pertained to the separation and contamination of recycled plastics. The convenience of the waste chute system in many residential apartments means more plastic goes in the waste stream than in the recycling stream, and then to incineration. Of the plastic that is being disposed of in the recycling bins, there is a high risk of contamination due to the tendency of normal waste being thrown into the recycling bins. Associated with this is the challenges faced by the waste collectors. Limited availability of waste collection workers has placed capacity constraints on Singapore’s waste collection system. Few Singaporeans entering the industry, with limitations on the quota on foreign workers employed. Lack of manpower could be overcome by full automation technology. However, as the current rate of recycling is so low at present, there is insufficient incentive to justify the provision of source-segregated transport. Due to the low volumes of recyclables collected, the waste management businesses also do not want to invest in automation technology for sorting waste. There is a lack of local demand for recycled plastic for manufacturing was identified as a primary constraint in the waste management business interviews and interview with the Karung Guni man (rag and bone man). For instance, the Karung Guni man stated that plastics are not profitable relative to other materials such as e-waste. This is due in part due to the difficulty of storing plastics. Plastics occupy a lot of volume despite being lightweight. The Karung Guni man indicated that even at the peak of plastic price, 1 tonne of plastic waste only fetches SGD1.50, which is insignificant considering the logistical issue in transporting the waste volume over a long distance. High storage costs are further exacerbated by high transport costs. Collecting and transporting plastics does not provide enough revenue to recoup the costs. This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 49 The interviewees further underscored the potential impact of China’s green fence policy where certain categories of plastic waste are prohibited from import into the country. The interview explained that the price per tonne for general waste is low and the disposal by chute is convenient. The long-term challenge will occur when the Semakau landfill is filled up, resulting to find a new landfill site that does not restrict port operations. Such a scenario will lead to increase in prices for disposal, and may consequentially create more lucrative opportunities for the plastic recycling industry. The interviewees further emphasised that strategic regional development of manufacturing demand for recycled plastic would be viable to mitigate the above challenges. This can be achieved through bottle-to-bottle recycling, at food and beverage manufacturing, in neighbouring countries, and in automotive and other sectors. Recycled plastic demand development will improve value placed upon plastic, and will subsequently drive this demand through the entire value chain. The interview highlighted that source segregation is only effective for commodities that have a sustainable price or demand. Source segregation will not work any better than co-mingling if cost recovery for multiple collections cannot be sustained. The interview concluded by stating that the future of plastic recycling in Singapore will not change unless the demand for sorted plastic recyclables is increased. This can predominantly be achieved by an aggregate and trade approach. Waste management businesses in Singapore would definitely need support once NEA builds the Integrated Waste Management Facility at Tuas South. Waste management businesses receive low to no returns during sorting of recyclable waste. The only returns received is while exporting the sorted materials for recycling. Support is also needed to reduce the landfill volume and reinvest of the cost saved from incineration to develop the recycled products market. At the same time, the policy support for regional integration with manufacturing in neighbouring countries is required. 3.4.2. Experts/Academics Academics were interviewed with an objective of a better understanding of plastic consumption trends; consumer motivations and recommended actions to promote increased plastic recycling. The interviews were structured using a combination of open questions to promote discussion and analysis. A summary of the discussion is outlined below: Plastic consumption trends Plastic consumption pattern has faced insignificant change over the years. Although awareness is high, particularly on the ill effects of plastic use, consumption patterns remain unchanged. The interviewee explained that as a developed country, Singapore is lagging behind its peers. Plastic is still indiscriminately used with almost no motivation to bring reusable bags. The low price of plastics is aggravating this issue. Due to a change in lifestyle, Singaporeans frequently dine outside and unconsciously consume more plastic (in terms of plastic cups, straws, plates, etc.). Singaporeans spend most of their day at work rather than home, as such commercial entities are generating more waste relative to residential properties. Hence, efforts on controlling plastic consumption and increasing plastic recycling should be focused on commercial entities rather than on private residences. This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 50 They explained that the ‘convenience factor’ has a big role to play in this. Singaporeans are buying convenience as they have the buying power. Plastic is readily available in Singapore. People will not bother to bring reusable bags with them while buying groceries after work. There was a time when food was wrapped in paper, now it is packaged in plastic. Most of the people use the plastic bags to dispose/bag rubbish at home. Therefore, they find it necessary to accept plastic bags from the supermarket. The convenience of throwing rubbish down the chutes in private apartments and HDBs also underscores this convenience factor. The interviews with teachers further emphasised this view. One interview revealed that accessibility and location of recycling bins played a major role in the effectiveness of the school recycling system. Recycling bins and general waste bins should be located in close proximity to one another. Another factor that is influencing plastic consumption is food safety. Food packaged in plastic prevents contaminations. However, consumers continue to request supermarket cashiers to separate wet and dry food, despite individual packaging to prevent these leakages. This behaviour indicates that consumers will likely resist or contend efforts to ban plastics. The interviewee explained that recycling and waste disposal habits are often governed by human behaviour. It is important to understand human behaviour to bring a change in their habits. Based on Behavioural Science there are two systems that govern decision making: System 1 and System 2. System 1 is intuitive, based on reflex. System 2 makes one ponder and think, and take action accordingly. For recycling, people only use System 1 type of thinking, which results in all types of trash in the recycling bin. People do have a general desire to recycle, but since the system does not communicate what is recyclable and what item should go into what bin, it results in a lot of trash. Hence, people are forced to use System 2 thinking while they face System 1 problem. If you want people to behave in a certain way, we have to look at how the message is being communicated. This starts when recycling bins in the country are standardised. This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 51 Plastic recycling challenges and opportunities The academic interviewee explained that co-mingled recyclable waste in Singapore has a high contamination rate; with 40% of the recyclables within the bin do not end up being recycled. Therefore, people’s confidence in the recycling system is no longer there. All the factors affecting the outcome must be properly controlled, only then the system will work successfully, in addition to having a will and determination to make it work. This includes looking at bin location, bin cleanliness, the frequency of renewal and training the collection staff and most importantly the most economic and logistics arrangement of collection and recycling materials. There are new recycling chutes built in the HDBs. However, these new recycling chutes may not increase the general recycling rate. As such, chutes are recently introduced in some of the HDBs; such features would take time to be implemented across the nation. In addition, co-mingled recycling chutes will not help in increasing recycling rates due to contamination. In those HDB complexes where this has been implemented, the recycling chutes are placed before the general waste chute. Due to the convenience factor, people are seen to dispose of all their waste in the recycling chute (since people have to walk ahead to dispose of general waste). Recycling infrastructure in Singapore can be improved by making logistics more viable and introducing some laws to address market failure. Subsidies should be introduced to help the waste management companies. The government should look at the total lifecycle costing of the waste management. In Japan, there are various types of waste materials to be segregated, and yet people there are habituated to segregate their waste effortlessly. The challenge in Singapore primarily pertains to the education and awareness of adults and children. While people would ask the children to be educated, it has not been proven that children can influence the adults. This view was strongly conveyed by the interviews with teachers. Interviewees suggested that children are only moderately aware of the process of how waste is disposed of in Singapore. Most schools are taking efforts to educate students on the negative impact of plastics on the environment by organising talks for the students, conducting outreach programmes and having lessons with recycling messages as part of the curriculum. In spite of this, teachers say that there is a lack of awareness among students on the types of plastics that can be recycled in Singapore and how to recycle them. Whilst schools can play a key role in promoting awareness with children, time and resources will need to be invested. One teacher indicated that there are too many programmes going on in school and it is difficult for teachers and students to dive deeper into one particular subject in school. This should be studied and tested to develop proven intervention tactics. The interviewee further explained that the government or retailers could consider incentives to encourage people to practice recycling, can also be beneficial. Incentives need not only be financial. ‘Feel good’ feeling can be considered as an incentive, as the crowding effect can influence the majority to practice recycling. Singapore also faces various challenges in sorting and cleaning of plastics. Without cleaning, other countries will not accept the used plastics. As water is a scarce resource and is costly, it is rare that used plastics are cleaned with water prior to export. Technology is available but This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 52 return on investment (“ROI”) is not attractive. The common lease period of 15 years is too short to justify investing in such technology. The land cost to build waste management facilities is prohibitively high as well. Since waste management companies do not invest in technology, they would have to rely on foreign workers. Unlike other high profile industries that Singapore is well known for, the waste management industry is not considered glamorous and hence not many people would likely to join such an industry. Therefore, the Singapore government may need to subsidise the technology in the future. If not, the waste management companies will not survive financially in the near future.

High Plastic Use in Singapore Single-use plastics are those forms of plastics that are used only once before disposal or recycling. Survey findings show that the population of Singapore is heavily dependent on single-use plastics, with increasing consumption patterns for plastic bags, and high consumption of PET bottles and PP items. 1. Plastic Bags: With the majority of the population going to the supermarket 3 to 5 times in a week and requesting between 1 and 5 plastic bags per shopping trip, the annual plastic bag consumption has risen drastically. The previous study conducted by SEC in 2013 revealed that most people use plastic bags to bag and dispose of general waste in Singapore. This has not changed and results still show that 67% of people are most likely use plastic bags to bag and dispose of general waste. As such initiatives to ban or tax plastic bags in Singapore are unlikely to be well-received by people owing to their dependency on this behaviour. Convenience has also played a key role for people to readily accept plastic bags. Convenience and habit play a key role in plastic consumption in Singapore. However, not all types of plastic bags can be used to line the garbage bin and reduction efforts should start by focusing on such plastics (single-use plastic bags). These include smaller bags given by bakeries, or plastic rolls placed at supermarkets to bag vegetables and fruits which are often disposed of with no apparent after-use. 2. PET Bottles: Survey results show that the annual PET consumption in Singapore is high, with 467 million9 bottles being used per year. The results further show that 37.09% of respondents are most likely to recycle PET bottles, and 36.89% have indicated that they are most likely to re-use the bottle. However, consumption is still high as bottled drinking water is a SGD134 million industry in Singapore with most of the water available in PET plastic packaging. PET bottles are recyclable in Singapore, and there is a need to cut-back consumption at the source and increase the recycling capacity of PET bottles in Singapore. 3. PP Plastics From the survey results, estimation shows that the number of PP items consumed per year is 473 million10, which is significantly high. Take-away containers significantly contribute to the high consumption of PP plastics. Targeted efforts are needed to encourage environmentally friendly packaging alternative or bring your own containers, and make it difficult to obtain plastic take-away containers. 9 Estimated figure based on survey findings and this is linearly scaled using Singapore’s population aged 20 and above (mid-year estimate 2017 which is obtained from Department of Statistics Singapore), which is the closest available demographic profiles of the survey respondents 10 Estimated figure based on survey findings and this is linearly scaled using Singapore’s population aged 20 and above (mid-year estimate 2017 which is obtained from Department of Statistics Singapore), which is the closest available demographic profiles of the survey respondents This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 54 4. Styrofoam Styrofoam containers present a clear example of the single-use plastics since they cannot be recycled or easily re-used. Styrofoam containers are used in Singapore as take-away containers for food. Findings show that 20.13% of the respondents in the survey think that Styrofoam can be recycled in Singapore. Just like PP plastic take-away containers, alternatives for Styrofoam is much needed to reduce the consumption of this single-use plastic. Single-use plastics are cheap and convenient to obtain, but use a lot of resources for manufacturing and have detrimental impacts on the environment. Significant effort need to be taken to reduce the use of these plastics, as well as increase the recycling capacity for those plastics that can be recycled. 4.2. Lack of Awareness among Consumers 1. Lack of Awareness on what to Recycle One of the most prominent findings from the survey results was that most respondents are not fully aware of what types of plastics can be recycled in Singapore – which is about 70% of the sample population. Findings from an interview with one of the academic experts revealed that recycling behaviour is automatic and intuitive. The expert has mentioned that people do desire to recycle, but since the system does not communicate what is recyclable and what item should go into what bin, recycling bins are contaminated with mixed waste. This fails the recycling process. Moreover, recycling bins in all public spaces are of different designs and colours, which make recycling confusing and difficult. As recommended by 45.16% of the respondents, the most useful information they would like to know regarding plastic waste recycling is an awareness of the types of plastics that can be recycled by them. Similarly, there is a need to make recycling an automatic yet an effective process by standardising the recycling bins throughout the country. 2. Lack of Awareness on how and where to Recycle Regarding the most likely reason why respondents would not like to recycle, 21.64% of the respondents, have chosen the option ‘Others’ and have indicated various reasons on why they would not recycle plastics. In this category, the highest percentage of respondents (35.92%) have commented that they find it inconvenient to wash and dry recyclables. Many others within this category who have indicated that they are not able to remove the food and oil contaminants from the plastics prior to recycling and hence do not recycle plastics. For those plastics that can be recycled, the NEA list of recyclables states to empty and rinse when necessary. Cleaning plastic containers to perfection is not compulsory. People need to be informed of this to encourage more recycling. Survey findings also showed that 21.24% of the respondents find it inconvenient to take recyclables to the recycling bin. This shows that recycling bins are not prominently placed around these areas. Recycling is also not as convenient as throwing rubbish into the chute. Recycling chutes in new HDBs are making it more convenient to recycle, but if respondents This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 55 aren’t aware of what and how to recycle, this would lead to contamination of the recycling bins. These results emphasise the need to develop recycling solutions that are convenient for the consumer, and educating consumers on how to recycle effectively to avoid contamination. This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 56 3. Lack of Awareness on Process of waste management in Singapore Out of 206 respondents who have given several options on why the most likely reason why they would not recycle plastics, 30 respondents have indicated that they do not recycle because they think their recyclables end up with general waste. Respondents have also indicated on wanted to know about the waste flow process in Singapore and what happens to recyclables after they have been placed in the recycling bin. This shows residents have not been made aware of the entire landscape of recycling in Singapore, which includes what they must recycle, how they must recycle, where to find the bins and what happens to their recyclables thereafter. 4.3. Recycling Efforts are Concentrated Upstream The surveys and interview findings show that, with the introduction of the National Recycling Programme in 2001, all efforts to increase the recycling rate is concentrated at the consumer level or upstream. Findings from an interview with a prominent waste management company in Singapore showed that the infrastructure for recycling can improve to make logistics more viable for transport of segregated recyclables. Studies (Keppel Seghers, 2012) also show that countries around the world are investing in infrastructure to improve their recycling rates downstream i.e. at the waste collection and incineration level. For Singapore to regain its status as a leader in waste management, the government may need to explore additional infrastructure investment. There is a need for smart and disruptive infrastructure and process in Singapore to facilitate waste recovery upstream. Recycling efforts both upstream and downstream will lead to effective waste management and significant material recovery. 4.4. Limited Market for Recycled Products The NEA website and other PWC websites have stated that domestic and industrial recyclables in Singapore are taken to material sorting facilities where they are sorted mechanically, baled and sent to local recyclers or exported for recycling. Furthermore, 7.60% of the total plastic export from ASEAN to China is from Singapore. Singapore is also known to send plastic waste to other countries in South-East Asia. The actual recycling of plastic takes place in these countries, which will be used to manufacture new products. As Singapore is not a manufacturing hub of plastics, there is no market within Singapore to recycle plastics. However, an industry that uses recycled plastics can be identified and a market for recycled plastics can be built within Singapore to cater to this industry. This would support the principle of circular economy in Singapore with plastic waste, as well as boost the economy of the country. This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 57 5. RECOMMENDATIONS 5.1. Efforts to Raise Awareness through Effective Campaigns (The targeted nationwide campaign could be implemented to increase consumer awareness of the environmental impacts of plastic waste and increase consumer knowledge on the type of plastics that can be recycled as well as the steps necessary to prepare the plastics for recycling in Singapore.) Targeted nationwide campaign could be implemented to increase consumer awareness of the environmental impacts of plastic waste. The campaigns could focus on the recycling process and aim to create consumer awareness on the types of plastics that can be recycled in Singapore, as well as the steps necessary to prepare the plastics for recycling (e.g. washing plastics before recycling). 1. (Campaigns for Awareness on Recyclables) 1. Campaigns to Simplify Consumer Recycling Process in Singapore (Campaigns ideas such as “Know Your Recyclables” would bring more awareness to people regarding the type of plastics that can be recycled and the steps necessary to prepare plastics to be recycled (such as cleaning it before it is deposited into the recycling bins) to reduce contamination.) Campaigns would bring awareness to consumers regarding the types of plastic that can be recycled in Singapore. This may include outlining the steps necessary to prepare the plastics for recycling, location of recycling bins, and the entire recycling process i.e. what happens to their recyclables, after it is deposited in the recycling bin. i. In public spaces, such as MRT stations, trains, elevators, bus stops and buses, advertisements in the form of posters can be displayed in an attractive manner via framing the posters with plastic bottles. The content of the posters would discuss the types of plastics that can and cannot be recycled and alongside, instructions on how to pre-treat plastic recyclables. ii. Promote mobile applications such as myENV mobile application developed by NEA and other such channels by incentivising downloaders of the app with a rewards system. The myENV mobile application contains the necessary information regarding why, what and how to recycle. Improvements to the application can include a more interactive user-friendly interface and the inclusion of games to entice the younger generation to adopt the use of this application. The completion of games in the application as well as carrying out recycling actions will reward points to the user to be used in the rewards scheme. iii. Organise talks for schools, universities and community centres inviting PWCs and Material Sorting Facility owners to educate and raise awareness on the types of items that can be recycled, what happens to recyclables and method of recycling. iv. Leverage on digital signage to show short video clips on trains, bus stops and in shopping malls on the types of waste (including plastics) that can and cannot be recycled as well as the steps required to prepare waste for recycling. The visual demonstration would capture more attention from commuters than a static poster or This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 58 written text containing the same information. The video could also show what happens to recyclables after consumers deposit their recyclables into the recycling bin. This serves to educate people and clear misconceptions on the outcome of recyclables. 2. Efforts to Reduce Single-Use Plastics Campaigns that focus on single-use plastics, explaining why we must reduce our dependence on them, what the alternatives are, and where to find them, may be effective topics. Campaigns conducted in partnership with industries that sell or use eco-friendly alternatives will also be necessary to raise awareness on where to obtain alternatives to single-use plastic. i. Campaigns could include posters on what are single-use plastics and why we must stop using them. These should be placed in public places, especially in hawker centres and food stalls near commercial complexes. Taglines such as, “It is just one plastic straw, said 5.6 million Singaporeans” can be used to promote awareness on the scale of the Singapore’s plastic waste footprint or the harmful effects of straws and the non-recyclability of them. ii. SEC and the government could work with hawker centres and start-up organisations to promote alternate forms of eco-friendly packaging to provide to the hawker centres and to encourage consumers to bring their own reusable containers. Several start-ups have developed sustainable packaging containers. Consumers can be given a choice to take away food in plastic containers or alternate packaging material (with or without the difference in price for both types of packaging). Sustainable packaging option would help reduce the plastic use of consumers, at the same time boost sustainable start-up companies in Singapore. iii. As the majority, 38.58% of the respondents have indicated that providing incentives for recycling would be the most effective way to encourage plastic waste recycling, campaigns could also focus on working alongside major hawker centres and food stalls around Singapore to device a system to provide incentives to consumers if they bring their own containers. Food coupons, rebates, vouchers, for instance, can be used to incentivise consumers to motivate them to bring their own containers. Posters on bringing own containers. iv. The campaign could encourage company employees to store their own containers in office pantries and use them to take-away food, instead of using Styrofoam and plastic cutlery. Similarly, companies can provide steel/glass containers and cutlery to their employees to be used during food take-away. Partnering with companies can promote this initiative, and for companies, this can be a part of their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) strategy. v. Introducing water fountains in public areas can incentivise people to bring their own bottles to re-fill water instead of buying PET packaged drinking water bottles. This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 59 5.2. Standardisation of Recycling Bins in Singapore As highlighted by a prominent academic during the interviews, recycling behaviour is intuitive. The interviewer also highlighted the need to standardise Singapore’s recycling bin system to support this behaviour. Another academic has highlighted the need to promote recycling and waste management in public and commercial entities. This goes to show that there is a need to concentrate recycling efforts in public and commercial entities by standardising recycling bins and its design throughout Singapore, which clearly explains what can and cannot be recycled. a. Nationwide initiative for increasing the awareness and encouragement of recycling. This may include diverting the attention of the public from throwing waste into general trash cans, towards the recycling bins. This could include placing creative signs on general trash cans pointing out the items that should not be thrown inside. The sign can also direct the public to the nearest recycling bin. b. Prominent academic interviewed mentioned that design plays a key role in regulating recycling behaviour. The recycling bins should be designed in a way that should promote recycling in a fast, automatic and frequent manner, instead of a slow, logical and calculating manner. The bins should facilitate information absorption automatically. The main aspect of the bin design is to make recycling an automatic process that does not require people to read and comprehend their actions. Design of the bin should facilitate the public to be informed on their recycling decisions prior to disposal into the bin. The design should also prevent unwanted disposal of recyclables into the bin. The following should be emphasised during design: Standardisation of:  Bin colour  Bin shape  Labels/information Consideration to be given to:  Bin location  Bin cleanliness  Innovative design of bins that prevents disposal of unwanted recyclables  Frequency of waste removal  Training of janitorial staff  Logistic arrangement of collection of recyclables 5.3. Concerted Effort for Plastic Reduction and Recycling in Singapore Review of literature from case studies of good recycling practices around the world has one aspect in common – which is the concerted effort taken by all stakeholders involved in recycling, to bring about a collective change to the system. Similarly, in Singapore, recycling This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 60 efforts should not be cornered to one end of the ecosystem. Instead, recycling should be addressed collectively by all stakeholders in the system. 1. (Dedicated Recyclable Collectors To improve the efforts of recycling in Singapore, specialised companies that primarily deal with recycling should be given the opportunity to operate in Singapore. Specialised recycling companies possess the necessary recycling technology and capabilities to handle recycling in Singapore. This opportunity exploitation for specialised companies to venture into Singapore could be done by separating the contracts for collection of general waste and recyclables. Furthermore, this could also potentially be a good investment opportunity for the government to not only improve the recycling rates in Singapore but also establish an economy for recycled materials.) 1. Region-wide (ASEAN) Plastic Recycling Hub Due to the limited land space in Singapore and labour constraints faced by the waste management industry, a regional collaboration is necessary to effectively manage plastic waste stream in Singapore and the rest of ASEAN. Countries abundant in land and labour could be well positioned to establish a plastic recycling hub with financial and technological aid from other countries in the region. Waste streams flowing to the designated recycling hub would need to be regulated. Singapore’s role in the region could be that of a technological leader, providing innovative tech-solutions to advance recycling efficiency. This would help to provide a market opportunity for the use of recycled plastics in Singapore, and the region in-turn. Multinational companies that have set targets for the use of recycled plastics in their products, can leverage on the plastics obtained from the recycling hub – thus, also ensuring a steady market for recycled plastics in the region. To achieve this, there is a need for a collaborative effort from all governments and industry in the region. 2. (Downstream Recycling Efforts in Singapore The public-private partnership of the waste-to-energy facilities in Singapore should account to include material sorting facilities to divert recycling waste from general waste for incineration. Downstream recycling efforts can supplement upstream recycling efforts to make the recycling system in Singapore more robust. Keppel Seghers owns and operates two waste-to-energy plants in Singapore. The company operates a Domestic Solid Waste Management Centre (DSWMC) in Qatar which is an integrated waste management system that treats mixed domestic solid waste. The DSWMC comprises state-of-the-art waste sorting and recycling facilities, a composting plant, and waste-to-energy incineration plants (Keppel Seghers, 2012). This model can be replicated for Singapore – with only the addition of composting and waste sorting and recycling facility. Similarly, NEA owns two of the waste-to-energy plants. Through these facilities, NEA can replicate the same model to recover recyclables within the facility of incineration.) This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 61 2. Downstream Recycling Efforts in Singapore If a region-wide (ASEAN) collaboration on plastic recycling (as given in 5.3.1) is difficult to achieve, Singapore can look to develop downstream recycling efforts. The public-private partnership of the waste-to-energy facilities in Singapore could account to include material sorting facilities to divert recycling waste from general waste for incineration. Downstream recycling efforts can supplement upstream recycling efforts to make the recycling system in Singapore more robust. Keppel Seghers owns and operates two waste-to-energy plants in Singapore. The company operates a Domestic Solid Waste Management Centre (DSWMC) in Qatar which is an integrated waste management system that treats mixed domestic solid waste. The DSWMC comprises state-of-the-art waste sorting and recycling facilities, a composting plant, and waste-to-energy incineration plants (Keppel Seghers, 2012). This model can be replicated for Singapore – with only the addition of composting and waste sorting and recycling facility. Similarly, the National Environment Agency (NEA) owns two of the waste-to-energy plants. Through these facilities, NEA can replicate the same model to recover recyclables within the facility of incineration. 3. Innovation to Reduce Plastic Packaging Waste Public sector organisations and NGOs could also partner with major packaging waste industries, such as food and beverage and consumer goods, to reduce plastic packaging of their products. These industries can account for this as their CSR activity, and at the same time, increase their brand reputation and have a positive impact on the environment. 4. Building a Market for Recycled Plastic through Innovation Upstream and downstream recycling efforts would not be effective unless there is a market built to collect and use the sorted recyclables. Government and public sector organisations could step-in to support existing markets in Singapore that are using specific types of plastics for manufacturing recycled plastic pellets. Buy-back centres for recyclables should be given government aid to support the principle of circular economy. At the same time, labour constraints for these sectors should also be eased to facilitate capacity growth in these industries. By establishing a market for recycled plastic, Singapore will be able to address the emerging limitations presented by China’s green fence policy and advance its position as Asia’s innovation hub, by developing innovative methods to reintroduce recycled plastic into the economy to aid growth and build a circular economy. For instance, the use of recycled plastic can support the current manufacturing segments in Singapore. Medical Manufacturing - Use of Shredded Plastic for 3D Printing The use of recycled plastics is finding its way into various industries, such as 3D printing. 3D printing allows the manufacturing of three dimensional objects from a digital file. Just like an inkjet printer needs ink cartridges to be able to print, 3D printers need plastic filament. According to Wohlers Report 2016 (McCue, 2016), the 3D printing industry This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 62 grew to USD 5.16 billion in 2015 and was projected to grow to USD 16.2 billion in 2018 (Chang, 2014). Economic Development Board (EDB) of Singapore posted an article in January 2018, on how 3D printing is transforming biomedicine in Singapore (Economic Development Board, Singapore, 2018). Based on the article, Singapore is leading the world in biomedicine, and 3D printing is the new technology that is making this possible. Several start-up companies around the world are devising machines to produce plastic filaments to be used for 3D printing machines. Singapore’s plastic waste stream should be directed towards recycling for biomedicine companies – for 3D printing for prosthetics (Charleston, 2017), and other medical devices. This would not only create a demand for recycled plastics within Singapore, but also reduce virgin plastics used for the 3D printing process in Singapore, at the same time contribute to the development of the biomedicine industry within Singapore, and a circular economy. Electronics Manufacturing with Recycled Plastic Singapore plays a leading role in the electronics industry. According to the Economic Development Board in Singapore many gadgets such as disc drives, printer heads and batteries are created in Singapore (Economic Development Board, 2018). More and more electronics manufacturers are using recycled content in the plastics used in electronics (Powell, 2017). Singapore can position itself as the innovation lead to provide recycled plastics in electronic components such as commercial flat-panel displays and ink and toner cartridges. There is also a lot of research work being undertaken in Singapore to push the boundaries of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and autonomous vehicles (AVs). The use of AI can be implemented to automate waste recycling in Singapore which would cut costs of labour intensive waste collection and sorting, and help achieve recycling at a reduced cost. Chemicals American Chemistry Council in 2011 published a paper on the use of pyrolysis technology to convert plastics to oil and fuel. Such technology includes conversion of plastics to gas, which is then converted to liquid, followed by acid removal process and finally, the separation or refining (American Chemistry Council, 2011). Over the years, similar technologies have been developed and perfected and are available for wide-scale adoption. The use of such technology provides the opportunity to overcome shortage of landfill space in Singapore, increase the recovery of plastics, aid Singapore’s petrochemical segments for economic growth and provide a circular economic model for plastics. 5. Replace Single-Use Plastic Bags/Rolls with Alternatives and Limit Plastic Bag Usage Not all types of plastic bags can be reused to line the garbage bin and reduction efforts should start by focusing on such single-use plastic bags. These single-use plastic bags include smaller bags given by bakeries, or plastic rolls placed at supermarkets to bag vegetables and fruits and are often disposed of with no apparent after-use. Public sector This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 63 organisations and NGOs could partner with major privately owned supermarkets in Singapore to replace plastic bag rolls for vegetables and fruits with effective alternatives. For instance, reusable bags made from super light, durable ripstop nylon or reusable organic cotton muslin bags act as a good substitute. The same initiative should be taken for bakeries across Singapore where consumers are encouraged to bring their own reusable containers when purchasing bread from bakeries instead of using the small non-reusable plastic bags provided. In tandem with this replacement initiative for supermarkets, a campaign titled “Two-is-Enough” will serve to limit the number of plastic bags taken at the cashier and encourage customers to bring their own bags thus this serves as an effective two-pronged approach for plastics reduction. 5.4. Legislation & Policy Measures A mandate is needed to increase the recycling rate from 6%. 1. Packaging waste reducing initiatives – reporting and declaration Countries such as Hong Kong, South Korea, and Taiwan have introduced mandates for packaging companies to declare the amount of plastics they use to package their products, as well as mandate to set targets to reduce the plastic packaging. Such mandates could facilitate engagement and collaboration between packaging and recycling companies and accelerate the transition to a circular economy. Packaging companies can work alongside industries to develop innovative methods to sell their products through smart packaging techniques. The statutory board in Singapore has announced that companies would be subject to mandatory reporting of packaging data and waste reduction plans by 2020. Mandating companies to print the recyclability information of their packaging products (such as resin number in PET bottles) would facilitate upstream sorting and recycling and is also necessary to ensure efficient collection of recyclables. This initiative, coupled with the campaign on creating awareness of the types of plastics that can be recycled, would target both upstream and downstream actors in the plastic ecosystem. 2. Step-Wise Reduction of Plastic Bags and Plastic Packaging A significant proportion of survey respondents (67%) indicated that bagging and disposing of general waste in a plastic bag is the most likely after-use pattern of consumers. Thus, big initiatives such as charging for plastic bags, or banning plastic bags in Singapore would affect consumers, and their habit to bag and dispose of waste in plastic bags. Instead, a step-wise approach to reduce single-use plastics can be adopted. The first immediate step could focus on reducing the use of those forms of plastics that are generally not reused by consumers for bin liners or for other purposes. These include small plastic bags obtained at bakeries, plastic packaging of vegetables and fruits at supermarkets, and plastic bag rolls to collect and weigh the fruits and vegetables. 3. Recycling in commercial entities The interviews with representatives from the waste management industry and academia underscored that commercial entities produce more plastic waste than consumers. This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 64 Therefore, amending the National Recycling Programme to mandate PWC to provide recycling bin and recycling collection services to commercial entities in addition to the current provision may improve recycling rates in Singapore. Such an amendment to the National Recycling Programme could take into account the number of commercial entities operating in the public waste collection sectors, and accordingly, provide tender to PWC to collect recycles from the bins. As indicated by the prominent PWC professional interviewed, the cap on foreign labours should also be eased to support PWCs with recyclables collection and sorting. This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 65 6. CONCLUSION Singapore needs to urgently address its high plastic consumption rates and improve its low and stagnating recycling rates. Singapore needs to reassess its plastic use, re-use and disposal habits to prepare for two major changes in its plastic ecosystem. China, Singapore’s largest plastic waste export partner plans to ban imports of plastic waste. At the same time, Singapore’s primary domestic landfill site is nearing capacity, other countries have developed processes and technologies to recover and recycle useful material to be re-used by the economy, Singapore seems to be lagging behind. This position paper proposes two effective ways to approach the plastic problem in Singapore through mitigation and management (or the 2-Ms):  Mitigating the use of single-use plastics  Management of plastic waste to stimulate a transition from a linear economy to a circular economy Convenience and habitual use of a range of plastics have resulted in high plastic usage in Singapore. As the majority of people re-use plastic bags, this position paper does not recommend the introduction of financial penalties, such as a per bag levy on consumers. Instead, this position paper recommends that more focused efforts should be targeted at mitigating the consumption of single-use, e.g., non-recyclable plastics, in Singapore. Low levels of awareness on the impact of single-use plastic could be countered through a step-wise approach to reduce plastic, which is needed to reduce the plastic waste load in Singapore. Step one can be to replace plastics that are generally not re-used by consumers, with environmentally friendly alternatives. (Effective management of plastic waste is also needed to recover recyclable materials and create a circular economy within Singapore. Low levels of awareness of people on the types of plastics that can be recycled could be overcome through targeted engagement and awareness raising. Campaigns targeted at consumers should provide information on the plastic lifecycle, and the types of plastics that can be recycled in Singapore. Upstream recycling measures coupled with awareness and concerted efforts to promote recycling downstream would lead to better recycling rates in Singapore. This will make recycling a profitable business within Singapore, and create a circular economy. For instance, the introduction of corporate subsidies or collaborative initiatives could incentivise and accelerate demand for recycled plastics.) Effective management of plastic waste is also needed to recover recyclable materials and create a circular economy within Singapore. Low levels of awareness of people on the types of plastics that can be recycled could be overcome through targeted engagement and awareness raising. Campaigns targeted at consumers should provide information on the plastic lifecycle, and the types of plastics that can be recycled in Singapore. Upstream recycling measures, coupled with awareness and concerted effort of all stakeholders to promote region-wide plastic recycling, or alternatively, promote recycling capabilities downstream, would lead to better recycling rates in Singapore. This will create a circular economy within Singapore. This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 66 The domestic plastic ecosystem in Singapore is complex with various factors and stakeholders involved. Learning from leaders in plastic waste recycling, such as Taiwan and Germany, highlight that all stakeholders have an equally important part to play in implementing a robust system of waste reduction and resource recovery. Only with a concerted effort by all stakeholders can Singapore progress to reduce dependency on plastics and effectively manage its waste. This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 67 Addendum to the Position Paper by the Singapore Environment Council Consumer Plastic and Plastic Resource Ecosystem in Singapore This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 68 Introduction and Background This document is an addendum to the attached “Consumer Plastic and Plastic Resource Ecosystem in Singapore: A Position Paper by the Singapore Environment Council” (‘Position Paper’). On 30 August 2018, Singapore Environment Council (‘SEC’) hosted the Singapore Environmental Achievement Awards (SEAA), held in conjunction with the SEC Conference Day 2018 where the Position Paper was presented. The SEAA and SEC Conference Day 2018 was attended by OVER 280 sustainability leaders and representatives from the 3P (Private, Public and People) sectors, working to support the Sustainable Singapore Movement and take action towards positive environmental initiatives. Themed “Re-economy: Creating a new plastics economy”, the conference provided a platform for SEC to gain further insights on the plastic resource ecosystem and explore how we can create a new plastics economy by working together to close the plastic waste loop. Insights from the panel discussions and participants’ responses via online polling have been captured in this addendum to the Position Paper. The SEAA and SEC Conference Day 2018 included a presentation of the Position Paper by Mr Mohit Grover, Partner, Deloitte Singapore Risk Advisory. The presentation included an overview of the methodology, key findings, recommendations by key stakeholders for the plastic ecosystem and potential market opportunities for recycled plastics. The presentation was followed by two panel discussions to further explore the consumer plastic and plastic resource ecosystem in Singapore. The panels were led by industry professions, sustainability and innovation experts, including: PANEL 1: THE CHALLENGES IN CLOSING THE LOOP PANEL 2: FUTURE OF PLASTCS Moderator Moderator Mr Simon Bennett, Singapore Environment Council Member of Board of Directors Mr Ian Hayes, GlaxoSmithKline Packaging Development Director Panellists Panellists Ms Lynn Loh, HP PPS Asia Pacific Pte Ltd Regional Head of Sustainability, Asia Pacific & Japan Ms Masayo Hada, Ricoh Asia Pacific Deputy Senior Manager, Regional Environmental Management Group, Service & Environment Division Dr Lee Hui Mien, Mandai Park Development Vice President for Sustainable Solutions Mr Emmanual Tay, Eco Innovative Founder and Director Mr Christopher Chan, RedMart General Counsel & Head of Government Affairs Mr Kenneth Lim, Neste Site Director Mr Ian Hayes, GlaxoSmithKline Packaging Development Director Dr Lee Hui Mien, Mandai Park Development, Vice President for Sustainable Solutions (Expert on Circular Economy) This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 69 Panel 1 Discussion Panel 1 titled ‘The Challenges in Closing the Loop’ aimed to explore the viability of developing a closed loop solution for plastic waste in Singapore. The moderator, Mr Simon Bennett, provided context by reiterating the low recycling rate of Singapore (estimated to be 6%). Drawing on the findings of the Position Paper, he also highlighted that the study showed that 70% of the respondents were not aware of the types of plastics that can be recycled in Singapore. Mr Simon Bennet opened the panel discussion by asking the panellists why recycling and awareness rates were so low in Singapore. The panellist highlighted various issues that they thought resulted in the low recycling rate in Singapore. They pointed out the complexity of recycling in Singapore and lack of simplification of the process. One panellist noted that all stakeholders involved in recycling, including the government and consumers, needed to work together to simplify the process. Another important issue highlighted by one of the panellists was the factor of convenience and how it worked against Singapore. Panellists discussed how the central chute for disposing rubbish – which is present in most housing complexes – makes the process of waste disposal convenient. This in turn, discourages residents to take the effort to bring their recyclables to the recycling bin, which are typically located at the basement of the housing complexes. The insufficient segregation of recyclable wastes at HDB (Housing Development Board) blocks and co-mingling of all recyclables instead of specific type, was also identified as a reason to discourage recycling. Panellists concluded that changing mind-set was the biggest challenge to recycling in Singapore, and that more needed to be done to increase consumer awareness and personal responsibility for plastic recycling. The audience was asked whether public education and running campaigns helped to increase the recycling rate in Singapore. 70% of the 167 participants that responded in the audience felt that public education and running campaigns would increase the recycling rate in Singapore. 70% 4% 26% Yes No Maybe This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 70 Figure 16: Audience Response: Would public education and running campaigns help to increase the recycling rate in Singapore? The panellists had various opinions on how to improve the low recycling rates in Singapore. One panellist suggested that standardisation of recycling bins throughout the country would be helpful in increasing the recycling rate. This would visually differentiate the waste bins to the recycling bins and promote recycling. One panellist emphasised the need for behavioural change, to encourage consumers to feel personally responsible for the waste they generate and dispose. Another panellist highlighted the need for more targeted education to help consumers understand which plastics can be recycled. The panellist noted that blue recycling bins (provided for recycling in selected housing complexes in Singapore) are often over-flowing as consumers are unsure which plastics they should and should not recycle. The audience was asked whether public information on how to recycle (e.g. washing plastics before recycling) is important in the whole education process of recycling. Out of 143 respondents, 77% of the participants thought that public information on how to recycle is important. Figure 17: Audience Response: Would informing the public on how to recycle (e.g. washing plastics before recycling) important in the whole education process of recycling? The discussion then moved from consumer practices to manufacturers. The moderator gave an overview of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) of manufacturers, and drew on a number of regulatory developments coming out from Europe as examples. The European Union (EU) Packaging and Waste Directive, which sets out recovery and recycling targets and deadlines for EU Member States was held up as a progressive piece of regulation. Panellists commented that EPR is not a new concept for many multinational corporations. For instance, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industries, have long had a focus on plastic waste reduction. Panellists highlighted the environmental and financial benefits associated with 77% 8% 15% Yes No Maybe This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 71 packaging waste reduction. For example, a reduction in packaging will translated into a reduction in packaging costs and recycling costs. The industry representative in the panel further highlighted the pressure for reporting packaging and recyclability information. The panellist noted that there was a growing pressure to effectively measure and disclose this information. The audience were subsequently asked to indicate whether manufacturers should take on more responsibilities in managing plastic waste. From 125 respondents, 82% agreed that manufacturers should take on more responsibility in managing plastic waste. Figure 18: Audience Response: Do you think manufacturers should take on more responsibilities in managing plastic waste? The panel were asked to consider the cost implications of increasing manufacturers’ recycling responsibilities. The panellists deliberated and pointed out challenges relating to the size of the Singapore market and the limitations in terms of economies of scale. Singapore’s current and potential market for recycled plastic is very small compared to other consumer markets in the region. As a result, the cost of introducing recycled plastics or committing to enhanced recycling responsibilities is higher. This sparked a broader discussion among the panellists around whether Singapore consumers would be prepared to pay a higher price for responsibly packaged goods. To address this dilemma, the panellists highlighted that greater focus were needed on the end-market for recycled plastic in Singapore. Panellists agreed that Singapore needs a few industry leaders to pioneer new approaches and pave the way for other organisations. Panellists ended the session by discussing the need for greater partnerships and a shared responsibility from the government, industry and consumers. Panel 2 Discussion Panel 2 titled ‘Future of Plastics’ aimed to explore the use of innovation to create markets for recycled plastics. Three panellists presented on how their respective organisations were using 82% 3% 14% Yes No Maybe This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 72 new technology to innovate plastic recycling. The presentations allowed the audience to understand new use-cases for plastic waste in a business (rather than consumer) context. The panel discussion focused on how China’s “Green Fence” policy, introduced in 2018, bans the import of certain recovered materials, including a range of plastic types. The “Green Fence” policy creates an opportunity for Singapore to develop recycling capabilities within the island. The panellist were asked the question on how viable it would be to establish a recycling plastics economy within Singapore. Panellists highlighted a number of challenges, including significant constraints on land space in Singapore and the labour required to carry forth the recycling industry. One of the panellist emphasised the importance of logistics in developing a recycling industry, including the logistics of collecting, segregating and recycling different types of plastics. Currently, Singapore does not have its own recycling centres. In order to develop a recycling industry within the country, there needs to be a viable market to buy and sell recycled plastics. Panellists pointed out two major limitations to this. First, demand for recycled plastics is currently low, and second, sales of recycled plastics are dependant on the market conditions. Fluctuating plastic commodity prices will not favour the development of a recycled plastic industry within the island. Audience were asked to indicate whether there is a business opportunity for recyclables (an existing but nascent industry) in Singapore. Out of 77 respondents, 52% were unsure whether a business opportunity for recyclables exists in Singapore. Figure 19: Audience Response: Is there a business opportunity for recyclables (an existing but nascent industry) in Singapore? The panellist were then asked whether Singapore could use its role as an emerging technology hub to develop new solutions and use-cases for recycled plastics. Panellists were unsure whether this was possible, pointing to examples from United Kingdom, Germany and the United States. While these countries had access to superior technology, they were not recycling and processing the materials collected. Instead, for years they have sent their waste to China 42% 6% 52% Yes No Maybe This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 73 and other countries in Asia for recycling. One panellist explained that recycling is seen as a ‘dirty industry’ and one that these countries are happy to outsource. The panellist also emphasised that it is for the same reason that China was looking to limit its plastic imports. However, if Singapore want a circular economy for its future, a possible way would be through developing recycling capabilities in the region – such as Philippines. Business opportunity for Singapore is definitely prevalent, however, collection of plastic waste and recycling can be a regional effort and in countries which has more abundant land and labour. The problem impeding Singapore from developing recycling capabilities within the island is also the need to sort different types of plastics before further processing. The cost involved in developing recycling capabilities within the island is high, and the recycled plastic obtained would not match up to the price, as recycled plastic is of a lower quality. Singapore could, however, takes a stronger role in promoting research, development and innovation of new recycling technologies to support the development of regional capabilities. The audience was asked to indicate whether Singapore would have a great impact on the plastic economy if it becomes a technological hub. From the 67 respondents, 55% voted ‘yes’ i.e. Singapore as a technological hub would impact the plastic economy, and 31% voted ‘maybe’. Figure 20: Audience Response: If Singapore becomes a technological hub, will this have a great impact on the plastic economy? Based on these results, the panellists moved the discussion towards the need for infrastructure investment in Singapore. Panellists again underscored logistics as a key aspect to improve recycling rate of plastics in Singapore. The panellists stressed the need for improved coordination and collaboration between government, organisations, logistics companies, and consumers to develop ways to recycle plastics, reduce cost of recycling plastics, and drive the change in mind-set of the people. There is also a need to source for the right kind of investor and create business opportunities for recycled plastic within the island. 55% 14% 31% Yes No Maybe This is a work-in-progress working paper and may contain preliminary results or conclusions, incomplete information or information which is subject to change 74 Importance of legislation was also discussed; the need to regulate packaging guideline, provide guidelines to reduce plastics at source and to regulate plastic usage. The concluding remarks from the panels was the need for shared responsibility between various stakeholders to improve the recycled plastic use and recycling capabilities in Singapore. The final polling question asked to the audience was to indicate whether the role of government is crucial in the development of an industry for recyclables. From the 67 respondents, 94% voted ‘yes’ – the role of government is crucial in the development of an industry for recyclables.

Recognizing the opportunity to examine closely the progress of Circular Economy adaptation within a nation with strong policy, this report seeks to explore the gaps and opportunities in advancing Circular Economy principles within the Singapore framework. The European Union’s approach to Circular Economy is evident both in the regulatory framework as well as the principles that underlie this regulatory framework. The underlying principles include: ● Clear prioritization of waste management initiatives as evidenced by the waste hierarchy, which allows for the emphasis on treatments that are higher up on the hierarchy. For e.g. supporting recycling over waste to energy. ● The setting of measurable targets, which allows each of Member States to develop plans to reach the required target rates such as recycling or recovery and explore the appropriate instruments (EPR, packaging fees, etc.) which will allow them to achieve the targets. ● Development of focused and customized approaches for each object of circularity, which allows for a more customized effort depending on the material and its circularity potential, for e.g. organic waste, waste, and electrical equipment (WEEE/ e-waste), packaging, single-use plastics. In the context of circular economy, the regulatory framework retains the twin goals of ensuring that targeted businesses remain competitive and consumers are not inconvenienced. The EU legal framework consists of several Directives, which are binding for the 27 EU member states and need to be transposed into national laws and regulations. They include in particular the EU Waste Framework Directive, the EU Directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste, the EU Directive on the reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment, the EU Directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment, and the EU Directive on the landfill of waste. Concerning plastic waste, the European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy of 2018 has provided the policy orientation during the last two years. Amongst others, it sets the goal that by 2030 all plastic packaging placed on the European market is either reusable or recyclable in economic terms. The most recent additions to the EU framework are (i) The Circular Economy Action Plan (as part of the EU Green Deal) which prioritizes a more legislated (rather than voluntary) approach towards product policies across the entire life cycle (not limited to energy consumption or sustainable sourcing) and (ii) The New Industrial Strategy for the EU which is intended to ensure the competitiveness of industry while becoming greener, more circular and more digital. The scrutiny on certain sectors is emphasized, along with a more harmonized approach to waste reduction (with a target to reduce residual or non-recyclable waste by 50%). This plan also recognizes the need for a market for secondary raw materials (ensuring offtake of recycled materials) as well as improving the state of local recycling efforts and reducing reliance on exports. A review of the EU framework provides an expansive set of best practices, highlights potential challenges, and helps identify critical instruments that could help achieve circularity goals. Furthermore, it provides a rich discussion ground for policy forward economies such as Singapore that have made forays into the field of circularity more recently. Singapore’s policy frameworks are driven by an obvious emphasis on an integrated planning approach as engaging in dynamic urban governance i.e. engaging extensively with the public, industry, and other stakeholders. Also important to the Singapore policy framework is aligned with its focus on resilience. The Climate Change Action Plan and the more recent Zero Waste Master Plan lay the foundations for increasing circularity in Singapore. The Zero Waste Master Plan spells out specific targets such as a 30% reduction in waste to landfill by 2035 and a 70% overall recycling rate (81% non-domestic recycling rate and a 30% domestic recycling rate). The key drivers for action in the Zero Waste Master Plan are identified as follows: 6 ● Firstly, pushing boundaries through Research and Infrastructure, ● Secondly, transforming the environmental services industry, ● Lastly, co-creating solutions with the community. The Resource Sustainability Act 2019 provides legislative support to the Zero Waste Master Plan, mandating specific reduction and reporting requirements for e-waste, food waste and packaging waste. The Resource Sustainability Act introduces EPR for e-waste and packaging waste, which is a big step in terms of reorganizing financing and organizing of collection, sorting and recycling of waste. Singapore’s waste management is marked by some really noteworthy accomplishments as well some challenges - the recycling rates for construction waste as well as ferrous and non-ferrous metals are extremely high (99% and 81% respectively), however the recycling of other materials such as glass, paper, fabrics and plastics is considerably low. The low levels of household recycling (17%) and the particularly low plastics recovery (4%) rate has been recognized as an area of concern and has prompted some initiatives to address the situation. These include introducing a state-of-the-art integrated waste management facility (IWMF) intended to extract recyclables as well as awareness-building efforts such as the Recycle Right Campaign. Other examples of exploring innovative technologies include the repurposing of incinerator ash into construction material, repurposing plastic waste into oil (chemical recycling into NEWoil) and piloting a Pneumatic Waste Collection System to extract recyclables from households etc. These technology centred efforts are supported by community and industry-focused efforts such as the RecycleRight campaign to build awareness, the INCUBATE program to support SMEs in the recycling sector, plastic bag fee pilots to explore consumer behaviour, as well as research-based efforts. Singapore is in the process of significantly improving its infrastructure with state of the art waste processing facilities which are diverse in nature covering: waste to energy, recyclables segregation and plastics processing as well as biological treatment. Each of these efforts reflects a carefully considered approach to identifying innovative solutions to waste. In addition, in line with its multi-stakeholder approach to urban governance, the Singapore government is fostering industry growth, including, partnerships such as: those of Alba and Wah Hua to improve waste management efforts in the Jurong urban region1; SME development through its INCUBATE program: government-industry partnership as the reverse vending machines pilot with the company F&N Foods2 Singapore; as well as government to government initiatives with the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City project. Each of these efforts is a step towards more efficient resource management and ultimately will have an impact on Singapore’s sustainability and circularity goals. Singapore has a unique leading position within the ASEAN region that cannot be ignored when it comes to implementing the Circular Economy. Much like in Europe, certain countries in ASEAN are leading the way (including Singapore) and all benefit from one another by learning from their respective strengths and weaknesses. Like with many other schemes, it is likely that policies implemented in Singapore with regards to the Circular Economy will be replicated in other ASEAN countries and a good example of this is the Singapore Green Label or the Singapore Green Mark Scheme considered as raw models and benchmarks in the region. Viewing Singapore’s efforts within a comparative framework across some of the more significant features of the EU Circular Economy framework reveals both the similarities and contrasts between the two approaches and also brings 1 The ALBA Group, is a recycling and environmental services companies, which was awarded the contract by the Republic of Singapore to set up a completely new waste management system in the Jurong urban region of over half a million people, to be served by a digitalised system meeting high environmental standards and providing capacity to collect around 17,000 tonnes of waste a year. Wah & Hua Pte Ltd (WH) is a Singapore waste management provider, which is providing collection, recycling, processes and disposal services and technologically-driven energy generation across the island.

This report highlights the avenues that are most promising for EU-Singapore Collaboration, which are summarised in the following table. OPPORTUNITIES FOR EU -SINGAPORE COLLABORATIONS Policy Integration Singapore could consider embracing a more comprehensive approach to the Circular Economy by enhancing its Zero Waste Master Plan while also benefiting from the refinements introduced by the EU. The shared goals of resource efficiency and climate resilience would also further the dialogue between the EU and Singapore. Waste Hierarchy Singapore could consider re-examining the waste hierarchy and identifying examples and opportunities from the EU to introduce greater emphasis and interventions at the reducing, reuse and recycling stages. Recognising the shared challenges of offshore recycling, both the EU and Singapore are in a good position to identify regional collaborations that are well supported and less vulnerable to political and business risks. Opportunities to explore innovative recycling infrastructure is another area of collaboration. Plastics Focussed Strategies A strong plastics focus could be considered with the possibility of drawing from the EU Directives, and adapting as necessary these to the Singapore context, by prioritizing more challenging aspects. These could include: progressively reducing single-use plastics production and consumption, reducing packaging waste, and increasing the recovery of packaging and other plastics. Using the EU approaches of quantifying and identifying the most challenging types/ forms of plastics would be beneficial to Singapore. For example, the EU Directive 2019/904 introduces a mix of measures that are tailored to certain plastic products (cutlery, plates, straws, cotton bud sticks, beverage stirrers, etc.) and includes an EU-wide ban on single-use plastic products whenever alternatives are available (effective 2021). Economic opportunity Given the focus on economic independence and maintaining its status as an attractive base for businesses, identifying economic and business opportunities through circularity would be paramount in the Singapore context. Studies and findings that substantiate this effect from the EU could be very useful. Circular Economy in Design, Waste Management & Recycling The EU and Singapore could collaborate in establishing and improving the collection of recyclables and to identify opportunities for recycling both locally and regionally. While the EU has considerable expertise with separate waste collection for recycling, many Member States may find themselves in a situation not too different from Singapore when looking for local recycling infrastructure and technology as well as regional offshoring potential. Therefore learning from this process would also benefit the EU. Extended Producer Responsibility The EU could collaborate with Singapore in sharing its EPR expertise and experiences. The varied use of EPR and other strategies to address plastics and packaging waste in the EU offer not only different approaches to enforcing these regulations but also the challenges to be anticipated and avoided. For example, Singapore’s EPR regulation with respect to e-waste has already established the requirements of the PRO. Green Public Procurement Even as the EU advances its efforts in establishing markets for secondary raw materials (or recycled materials) and adds greater emphasis to the offtake of green goods through mandatory green procurement targets, Singapore too, is on the cusp of expanding its green procurement policy. It is opportune timing to explore potential policy standards that could also be extended throughout the region. 8 Innovation and Research Singapore has invested heavily in its research and development capabilities and has a strong preference for innovation. Sharing of research and collaborating on new research could be an important opportunity to liaise with the EU3. Regulatory Frameworks The advanced regulatory framework in Singapore allows for exploring potential adaptations of successful EU regulations paving the way for a more harmonized global policy framework. The opportunities discussed in the table above can be categorised based on the following approaches and what the priorities for each country are. The different approaches have been identified as Policy Cooperation, Innovation & Collaboration, Standardisation, and Sharing of Learnings. Each of the opportunities/ policy instruments is then placed within this context and indicated in the figure below: While each of the above policy measures is important in its own capacity, to manage the scope of the report we limit a more detailed exploration to Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) and Green Public Procurement (GPP). Both of these policy instruments have been prominent within the EU frameworks and have been carefully considered within Singapore as well. The report examines the opportunities for EU - Singapore engagement with respect to more detailed aspects of each of these instruments: ● EPR - The EU approach to EPR is discussed keeping in mind the varied applications across Member States. The Singapore EPR policy specifically with respect to E-waste as well as the requirements with respect to 3 In this regard, the research collaborative partnership between the French CEA and the NTU Singapore focussing on electronic waste and the Circular Economy, called ‘SCARCE’, could provide some useful lessons learned for future collaboration between Singapore and EU Member States 9 packaging (mandatory reporting and DRS systems) are discussed. Given the relatively nascent EPR policy application in other industries within Singapore, it could explore the EPR potential for other materials based on EU experiences. The EU has a long experience with DRS systems which could certainly be of use to Singapore’s implementation agenda. To the extent that there are innovative and industry-centric schemes that engage businesses in developing unique and novel approaches to address the issue of packaging design and recycling, Singapore could adapt these EU initiatives to its local context. ● GPP - Singapore’s public purchasing power is very powerful yet currently unexploited with regards to GPP. Considering its extensive experience, the EU could contribute to policy formulations and customizing sector-specific purchasing solutions. Singapore’s GPP directives are predominantly targeting the country’s own labelling schemes. While it is a good effort to promote local initiatives this also restricts the choice of green products and services. Exploring bilateral partnerships between Singapore Environmental labelling schemes and the EU Eco labels could be an avenue for GPP collaboration. The report concludes with a framework to prioritize next steps with respect to Singapore-EU collaboration. QUICK WINS Given the ease of adoption, these strategies will build trust and create a conducive environment for longer-term engagement. Examples include: ● Adoption of the Waste Hierarchy. ● Alignment on Landfill Management Principles. In Singapore, landfill solutions have become an urgent matter as its only offshore landfill is reaching saturation. ● Innovation and Research. Singapore is pushing for active research on circularity and welcomes foreign expertise. There is also significant funding available for research in Singapore. ● Adoption of GPP and strengthening of Eco Labels. ● Regulation to phase-out of certain single-use plastic products. On this last point, based on the EU Single Use Plastics Directive (EU Directive 2019/904), Member States are required to have regulations in place that restricts the placing on the market of single-use plastic cutlery, plates, straws, beverage stirrers, styrofoam food, and beverage containers/cups, cotton bud sticks, sticks attached to balloons. EU Member states need to have regulations in place by July 2021. It remains to be seen how the market adapts, whether reusable 10 alternatives or alternatives made of other materials will be available and the debate will focus on what is actually environmentally friendly and what is not. An exchange between Singapore and Europe exploring possibilities could be interesting. LONG TERM ENGAGEMENTS These strategies will lead to high levels of circularity and already have the required framework to adapt to the Singapore context. ● Segregated Waste Disposal and Collection. ● Adoption of EPR and DRS System. LOW PRIORITY These strategies are neither easy to adopt nor likely to have a great impact in terms of circularity for Singapore, given disparities when compared with the EU. Examples are: ● Alignment on production and source reduction standards (this would be very complex to implement in Singapore and it will take time to change the regulatory framework, furthermore Singapore is a very competitive economy so it is unlikely that the Government would put a break on the manufacturing sector easily especially for SMEs). ● Developing Secondary Market strategies. While these strategies are much needed, it would be best to strengthen existing frameworks before exploring secondary markets. Recycled content standards with a long implementation horizon could work, however Singapore would need to identify global sources for recycled feedstock, given the lack of a recycling industry. Secondary markets in the EU are still being developed and are not yet mature. ● Waste to Energy. This aspect is already well taken care of in Singapore and would be the least preferred option in terms of developing the Circular Economy. EXPLORATION These strategies may be harder to adopt/ implement but are likely to have great impact on circularity. They merit careful consideration. Developing longer term engagement with the EU will allow for continuous guidance and knowledge sharing. Examples include: ● Alignment on a comprehensive circular economy policy with deep focus on plastics. ● Local and Regional Recycling Opportunities. Looking beyond Singapore, the context in Europe and ASEAN are similar, considering the great disparity between individual member countries on the adoption of Circular Economy principles. Singapore has a robust legal framework and is leading the way on certain circularity aspects such as research and construction waste recycling. However, other aspects and in particular plastic recycling are better reflected in other ASEAN countries, like Thailand. As in Europe there are a lot of opportunities to learn from best practices at the regional and global level. The Circular Economy journey has only just started in Asia and much still needs to be done to truly adhere to such a business model. The timing for collaboration between the EU and Singapore could not be better as both geographies are in the process of increasing their efforts in waste prevention and management, and aiming for stronger circularity within their frameworks. This is well expressed in recent published reports in both geographies released at about the same time. There are clear synergies of objectives to achieve and many of the specific targets set out in these reports are well aligned; a promising sign that mutual collaborations could strengthen their individual programs. 11 SECTION 1 CIRCULAR ECONOMY IN THE EU AND SINGAPORE 12 1.1 INTRODUCTION REPORT BACKGROUND Much like the European Union (EU), Singapore has a policy forward approach to achieving its economic and sustainability goals. Circular Economy thinking has been widely adopted as a long-term strategy and solution for plastics and packaging and policies related to it have been gaining popularity globally. While circular economy policies have been well established in the EU and its Member States, it has only recently gained popularity in Asia and Singapore in particular. Singapore, often hailed as one of the leading examples of growth and innovation in ASEAN and greater Asia, offers a unique opportunity to witness the adaptation and implementation of a Circular Economy framework, given the recent policy developments. Recognizing the opportunity to examine closely the progress of Circular Economy adaptation within a nation with strong policy, this report seeks to explore the gaps and opportunities in advancing Circular Economy principles in Singapore (primarily) and the region to some extent. REPORT OBJECTIVES AND METHODOLOGY While addressing the broader concepts of Circular Economy, this report aims to align with the global focus on plastics circularity. The report first briefly examines the EU framework along with its underlying principles and most recent Circular Economy developments and then goes on to explore the Singapore landscape. In exploring the EU principles, the report explores the evolution and development of Circular Economy policies, however, the specific implementation of these policies within the Member States is beyond the scope of this report. The section concludes with an analysis that identifies gaps and opportunities for learnings from the EU context. In the second part of the report, two important instruments of the circular economy policy frameworks, Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) and Green Public Procurement (GPP), are reviewed to identify their varied application in both the EU and in Singapore. Also explored is the potential for both of these instruments to enhance the Circular Economy efforts in Singapore. While there are numerous other interventions, the scope of the research is limited to EPR and GPP as informed by the initial design of the project and the opportunities they present for bilateral collaboration between the EU and Singapore. The report relies primarily on secondary sources, but also includes insights and learnings gained from presentations and materials shared by experts and authorities in Singapore. Additionally, key stakeholders in government and industry were invited to respond to a series of questions so as to gather key perspectives. The questions, the list of stakeholders contacted, and a summary of the responses are included in the Appendix. 1.2 EUROPEAN UNION (EU) - DEVELOPMENT OF A CIRCULAR ECONOMY FRAMEWORK AND ITS IMPACT ON PLASTICS UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES AND POLICY LANDSCAPE The Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe (European Commission, 2011) was a first step towards integrating Circular Economy principles in EU-wide policy making, stressing the key success factor of involving a wide range of stakeholders in priority setting, implementation and governance. Soon thereafter the Manifesto for a Resource-efficient Europe (European Commission, 2012) was released, calling for a circular, resource-efficient, and resilient 13 economy. Then came the EU Action Plan for the Circular Economy (European Commission, 2015)4 which resulted in the 2018 Circular Economy Package. The Circular Economy Package includes measures that aim to help stimulate Europe's transition towards a circular economy, boost global competitiveness, foster sustainable economic growth and generate new jobs. As part of these measures, the European Commission presented the EU Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy (2018), and prepared a new EU Directive on the reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment, which entered into force in June 2019.5 This new EU Directive has enhanced the legal framework at European level, which also includes other Directives, such as the EU Waste Framework Directive 2008/98/EC, the EU Directive 94/62/EC on Packaging and Packaging Waste and the EU Directive 2012/19/EU on waste electrical and electronic equipment.6 These approaches have been amplified in the most recently launched Circular Economy Action Plan (March 2020). The European Union’s approach to circular economy is premised on the following underlying principles, all the while recognizing the need for a competitive economy and consumer satisfaction7: A clear prioritization of waste management initiatives The EU has an established waste hierarchy which prioritises reduction and reuse models above recycling. The Waste Framework Directive (WFD)8 introduces a five-step waste hierarchy where prevention is the best option, followed by re-use, recycling and other forms of recovery, with disposal such as landfill, as the last resort. EU waste legislation aims to move waste management up the waste hierarchy. There is a ranking which indicates a clear preference for: first, closed-loop recycling (i.e. items recycled into the same products); then, downcycling (i.e. content recycled into another product); and then, molecular recycling (i.e. extracting valuable chemicals), followed by energy recovery. Incineration and landfill are seen as a last resort which is a contrast with Singapore which currently sees incineration as its main solution. The setting of measurable targets Each step in the EU Circular Economy journey has been marked by the setting of specific targets and timelines for achieving these. Such targets are aimed at ensuring a steady but assured transition to a circular economy and include common targets such as those for recycling of municipal solid waste and packaging waste but also specific ones related to different packaging materials.9 Development of focused and customised approaches for each object of circularity The EU approach to circular economy focuses on the three main aspects of: ● Sustainable production (eco-design, business models); ● Sustainable consumption (eco-consumption, reuse and preparation for reuse, collaborative economy); and ● Material resource management (waste prevention, systemic eco-innovation, ‘raw material’ strategy, recycling). The EU policies aim to address each aspect of circularity and customised approaches have been developed for different products (e-waste, plastics, etc.). The policies also address specific requirements based on usage (Single Use Plastics 4 https://ec.europa.eu/environment/circular-economy/first_circular_economy_action_plan.html 5 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32019L0904 6 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:01994L0062-20180704 7http://sos2019.sea-circular.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FINAL_THE-ROLE-OF-PACKAGING-REGULATIONS-AND-STANDARDS-IN-DRIVING-THE-CIRCULAR-ECONOMY.pdf 8 EU Waste Framework Directive: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32008L0098 9 The EU Action Plan for the Circular Economy establishes a common EU target for recycling 65% of municipal waste by 2035; a common EU target for recycling 70% of packaging waste by 2030; and specific targets for packaging materials like, Paper and cardboard (85%), ferrous metals (85%), Glass (75%), Plastic (55%) and Wood (30%). It also stipulates a binding landfill target to reduce landfill to maximum of 10% of municipal waste by 2035. 14 Directives) or material types (Biodegradables, Glass, PET etc.), an approach which ensures that opportunities for circularity are accelerated for specific material streams. The WFD, the Landfill Directive10 and the Packaging Waste Directive11, constitute the legal framework which has contributed to the relatively higher recycling and recovery rates of packaging waste in the EU Member States (with much variation among the Member States). Each of these Directives and the ones that followed have established specific targets and timelines for the achievement of those targets which have hastened the advancement of the Circular Economy in many of the EU Member States. National, regional and local governments and authorities support the circular economy through sector policies, laws and regulations, as well as by setting up platforms or funding schemes. Stakeholders interact and share experiences via the European Circular Economy Stakeholder Platform (ECESP). The platform was established in 2017 by the European Commission and the European Economic and Social Committee to promote the circular economy across territories, sectors and themes by gathering knowledge and fostering dialogue. Table 5 in the Appendix summarizes the key features of each of the EU policy instruments in greater detail. Graphic 1: EU Circular Economy Policy Framework The Circular Economy Action Plan of 2020: The Circular Economy Action Plan 12 was announced in alignment with European Green Deal13 and the New Industrial Strategy14, presenting EU’s most ambitious roadmap to date with respect to circularity. The EU Circular Economy Action Plan can be subdivided into six key actions to take place over the next decade: ● Products Policy Framework: First, the EU aims to put a greater emphasis on circularity concepts for products recognizing that designing for circularity cannot be limited to the sustainability and energy efficiency of products or be solely addressed by voluntary labelling initiatives and green procurement practices. The EU will propose a Sustainable Product Policy Legislative Initiative following directive principles. The aim is to expand to a broader sustainability framework and also to move from a voluntary 10 EU Landfill Directive: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:31999L0031 11 EU Packaging Waste Directive: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:01999L0031-20180704 12 EU Circular Economy Action Plan: https://ec.europa.eu/environment/circular-economy/pdf/new_circular_economy_action_plan.pdf 13 European Green Deal: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:b828d165-1c22-11ea-8c1f-01aa75ed71a1.0002.02/DOC_1&format=PDF 14 EU New Industrial Strategy https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/fs_20_425 15 based system to one which is increasingly legislated. Some further initiatives planned include: the establishment of a European Dataspace for Smart Circular Applications; greater products content transparency to provide customers trustworthy information (some EU Eco-labelling schemes have been misleading); and the introduction of a “right to repair” policy to push manufacturers to redesign products for extended use. Last, the EU will also propose minimum mandatory GPP criteria and phase in compulsory reporting to monitor its uptake. Noteworthy is that GPP is gaining momentum in Europe especially in the past few years (refer to section 4). ● Prioritizing Sectors such as Electronics and ICT; Batteries and vehicles; Packaging; Plastics; Textiles; Construction; as well as Food, Water and Nutrients. While all sectors should be given attention, it is important to prioritize according to the sectors which have both the most impact and potential for improvement. ● Waste reduction: Next, the EU will aim for lesser wastage and valuing waste. Despite efforts, the amount of waste generated in the EU has to date not gone down. Indeed, annual waste generation from all economic activities still amounts to 2.5 billion tonnes (or 5 tonnes per capita) a year and each citizen produces on average nearly half a tonne of municipal waste. The objective going forward is to halve the amount of residual (non-recycled) municipal waste by 2030 (Singapore’s target by comparison is 30%). These efforts will be supported by enhancing the implementation of existing EPR systems, rolling out the Sustainable Product Policy, as well as harmonizing separate waste collection systems; increasing high-level exchange on the Circular Economy and stepping-up cooperation with member states, regions and cities (refer to section 3). ● Creating a secondary market: Another component of the strategy will be to create a well-functioning EU market15 for secondary raw materials. This will be achieved by introducing requirements for recycled content and EU-wide end-of-waste criteria for certain waste streams; Enhancing the role of standardization; Imposing restrictions on substances of high concern and creating a market observatory for key secondary materials. ● Addressing waste exports from the EU: For many years, businesses within developed countries such as EU members have been exporting their recyclable waste (e.g. plastics) to developing countries for treatment. There has been much media scrutiny and public debate with regards to the sustainability and ethical acceptability of such exports. At the start of 2019, EU exports of plastic waste to countries outside the EU amounted to around 150,000 tonnes per month at the start of 2019.16 The European Commission’s Plastic Strategy addresses this issue, stating that: “It will also be important to ensure that any plastics sent abroad for recycling are handled and processed under conditions similar to those applicable in the EU under rules on waste shipments, supporting action on waste management under the Basel Convention, and developing an EU certification scheme for recycling plants.”17 Many receiver countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines have already started to respond by banning the import of certain types of waste (e.g. plastics) into their territories and sometimes even returning18 the waste as a show of dissatisfaction. The EU is exploring the opportunities to promote recycling within the EU, and new rules on waste shipment are currently being developed based on the Basel Convention. 15EU secondary market: https://resource.co/article/eu-plastics-strategy-aims-build-secondary-markets-make-recycling-plastics-profitable-12352 16https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/waste/resource-efficiency/the-plastic-waste-trade-in 17https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1516265440535&uri=COM:2018:28:FIN 18Indonesia returning plastic wastes to the EU: https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/indonesia-to-return-49-containers-of-waste-to-europe--us-11684324 16 ● Last but not least, the EU intends to make circularity work for people, regions and cities. The actions required to make this possible will involve a diversity of community programmes and initiatives. There is again a high potential for collaboration on such aspects with Singapore as it is also in the process of rolling out ambitious waste management communication plans at the city level. WHY THE EU FRAMEWORKS ARE AN IMPORTANT STARTING POINT The EU has a long history of integrating Circular Economy within its policy and legal frameworks (not only strategies and action plans), and continues to strategically improve upon its efforts in this direction. This dynamic approach allows for other regimes to learn not only from policies that have resulted in success, but also from those that either were circumvented, inadequately adapted or simply unsuccessful. The EU’s Directives have had differentiated adoption and application in each of the Member States affording a rich source of learnings and opportunities, especially for developed and policy-forward nations such as Singapore. Governments, businesses, local authorities, consumers and non-governmental organisations need to work together to overcome these and create an environment where consumables can be exploited without negative side-effects. These complexities provide insights into identifying an improved or more customised approach for newer policy regimes. For the specific example of plastics, a recent study19 led by the EASAC (European Academies Science Advisory Council) has pointed out that to move forward with a Circular Economy model a Systems Approach to the problem must be adopted. For instance, looking at the packaging issue will require changes throughout the value chain: i) Packaging manufacturers would need to simplify their current complex mixtures to become easier to recycle ; ii) Retailers would need to contribute by thinking as hard about effective end of life reuse or recycling as they do about the attractiveness of their packaging to the consumers ; iii) Consumers, who have embraced the “on the go” and “throwaway” culture, would need to could start to see packaging as something to be returned rather than to be discarded. 19 EASAC Report: Packaging Plastics in the Circular Economy: https://easac.eu/fileadmin/PDF_s/reports_statements/Plastics/EASAC_Plastics_Web_complete_6May2020_FINAL.pdf 17 Graphic 1: Evolution of the Recycling Rate of Plastic Packaging in the EU (Source: European Commission, Eurostat)20 The above graphic shows that the recycling rate of plastic packaging has overall steadily increased since 2006. The slowing down in recycling rates in recent years (likely due to export limitations) is, however, an indication that it is time to renew circularity efforts. Furthermore, the consumption of packaging, including plastic packaging, is rapidly increasing. Most of the attention over the last decade has been put in improving waste management aspects and processes (e.g. collection, landfills). The recycling rates have improved over the years but by relying heavily on waste exports (primarily, plastics and e-waste). However, the tightening of international policies with regards to treatments of foreign wastes as well as materials toxicity regulations (e.g. the Basel Convention) is now forcing the EU to rethink its strategy and to develop treatment solutions for waste within its borders. Reviewing the EU landscape provides a comparative backdrop for Singapore’s circularity efforts. Furthermore, similar to the EU’s attempt to facilitate a harmonised approach towards circularity amongst Member States, with a comprehensive policy framework, Singapore too can pioneer a similar approach within the ASEAN region. CIRCULAR ECONOMY IN EUROPE The concept of Circular Economy is not new in the EU, in fact it has been on the agenda for the last twenty years. However, despite some successes achieving efficient recycling rates in countries leading the way such as The Netherlands, Denmark and Germany, waste prevention and management in the EU still has a long way to go to achieve a Circular Economy model. 20 Eurostats, recycling rate of plastic https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/DDN-20181129-1 18 While aiming for a Circular Economy, the EU demonstrates strength on several waste management fronts including a widespread recycling mind-set; some significant advancements in technologies and research; developed policies and frameworks and particularly strong eco-labelling and EPR schemes (refer to section 4). On the other hand, the EU is also facing major challenges such as significant circularity adoptions disparities between member states, complicated regulatory frameworks between the European Union and individual member countries, and most recently restrictions on exports which is forcing the EU to increase its domestic recycling capacities instead of relying on foreign waste treatment. Some new initiatives under development are promising and could lead to interesting collaborations such as the creation of a secondary market for recycling as well as “right to repair” policies. It is important to highlight that the EU has a well-established waste hierarchy which prioritises reduction and reuse models above recycling. Overall the EU shows a strong will to strengthen its position on the Circular Economy and brings decades of trials and errors. The next section will explore the specific context of Singapore, one of the world's smallest nations yet a powerful economy with big ambitions and aiming to lead the way on the Circular Economy in ASEAN. 1.3 SINGAPORE - POLICY FRAMEWORK AND WASTE MANAGEMENT LANDSCAPE Singapore’s incredibly rapid development over the last 50 years into a high-income economy has been one marked by economic growth, but also its remarkable environmental transformation. This section of the report will focus on Singapore’s efforts in addressing waste management while exploring the opportunities and challenges to pursuing an approach of Circular Economy especially with relevance to plastics and packaging. Underlying Principles Singapore generates more than 7 million tonnes of solid waste annually, of which more than 4 million tonnes was reported to be recycled.21 The remaining is either incinerated or landfilled at the Semakau Landfill which is anticipated to reach capacity by 2035. The tonnes recycled do not reflect the domestic recycling rate which is reported to be only 17% for 2019. The government in Singapore has made some deliberate efforts to combat these realities. The Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment designated 2019 as the Year Towards Zero Waste to raise awareness of waste issues in Singapore, rally Singaporeans to treasure its resources and build a strong reduce-reuse-recycle culture, and pave the way towards a Circular Economy and a zero-waste nation. The Sustainable Singapore Blueprint22 released in 2015 set a target of increasing the national recycling rate to 70% and domestic recycling rate to 30% and non-domestic recycling rate to 81% by 2030. The underpinnings of the Singapore approach are highlighted in this blueprint and related examples: ● Integrated planning by making use of digital planning tools, new and innovative technologies to model future scenarios using data. Successful examples include developing the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System and the satellite-based Electronic Road Pricing System (to manage congestion). 21https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/waste-management/waste-statistics-and-overall-recycling 22Singapore Sustainable BluePrint: https://www.mse.gov.sg/docs/default-source/module/ssb-publications/41f1d882-73f6-4a4a-964b-6c67091a0fe2.pdf 19 ● Dynamic urban governance: engaging government institutions while also engaging the public and community groups as well as the private sector in allowing everyone to invest in their well-being. Examples are evident in the Community in Bloom program23 (a community garden initiative), The Clean and Green Singapore 24(a campaign aiming to inspire Singaporeans to care for and protect common spaces and the environment by adopting a clean and sustainable lifestyle) and the Singapore Packaging Agreement (SPA), a voluntary agreement to which the National Environment Agency (NEA) and 170 organizations including businesses and industry organizations are signatories. Another key driving force underlying Singapore’s policy framework is its resilience strategy which targets climate change while at the same time ensuring resource and economic resilience25. Circular Economy, although not explicit in the Climate Action Plan, it has been identified as the recommended approach in the Zero Waste Masterplan26 which also aims at resource conservation. The Singapore Zero Waste Master Plan states that “in a resource and carbon constrained world, we need to adapt a circular economy approach where scarce resources are valued and kept in use as long as possible,” and also that “by conserving resources, we can also reduce GHG emissions”. This builds up Singapore’s Climate Action Plan27 which was released in 2016 and outlines strategies for climate change adaptation and mitigation. In an attempt to rally the public and industry, 2018 was identified as the Year of Climate Change with a focus on carbon and greenhouse gas emissions. The Carbon Pricing Act28 in operation from 2019, requires the measuring and reporting of emissions, with taxable businesses facing a tax rate of SGD5 per tonne of GHG emissions. Together, these climate and Circular Economy policies constitute a solid base upon which further Circular Economy efforts can be developed and implemented. Policy Landscape: Singapore’s Zero Waste Masterplan Singapore’s economy is still to date predominantly based on the linear “take-make-dispose” model and its vision is clearly to move away from it through one that reuses resources endlessly. In the “Zero Waste Masterplan Report” which presents the national waste management strategy, the focus is on the Circular Economy over the next 10 years. The overall objective of this Master Plan is to strengthen three resilience in Singapore: i) Climate Resilience by addressing existential threats especially rising sea level, ii) Resource resilience by ensuring a safe and secure supply of critical resources such as food and water and iii) Economic resilience by ensuring that the future of Singapore’s economy remains competitive by overcoming carbon and resources constraints. It is clear throughout this Masterplan that the main strategy will surround the adoption of a Circular Economy concept uniting and ensuring greater sustainability in the production process, consumption practices and waste management solutions. The Resource Sustainability Act29 (2019) establishes a regulatory framework to address the waste streams identified in the Zero Waste Master Plan: ● Food Waste: from 2024 onwards, owners and occupiers of commercial and industrial premises that generate large amounts of food waste will be required to segregate their food waste for treatment, either on-site or off-site. ● E-waste: a regulated management system will be introduced by 2021 to collect and properly treat e-waste. 23 Community in Bloom Program: https://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardening/community-in-bloom-initiative 24Clean and Green Singapore Campaign https://www.cgs.gov.sg/ 25Singapore’s Climate Action Plan: A Climate-Resilient Singapore, For a Sustainable Future. https://www.nccs.gov.sg/docs/default-source/publications/a-climate-resilient-singapore-for-a-sustainable-future.pdf 26Singapore Zero Waste Master Plan https://www.towardszerowaste.sg/zero-waste-masterplan/ 27Singapore Climate Action Plan: https://www.mewr.gov.sg/docs/default-source/default-document-library/a5finalmerw.pdf 28 Singapore Carbon Pricing Act: https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Acts-Supp/23-2018/Published/20180601?DocDate=20180601 29 Singapore Resource Sustainability Act: https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Acts-Supp/29-2019/Published/20191004?DocDate=20191004 20 ● Packaging waste including plastic: businesses that produce packaged products are required to collect their packaging data and 3R plans from July 1st, 2020 for submission to the NEA in 2021. (This has now been extended by a year to accommodate COVID-19 related challenges). Targets: When it comes to achieving tangible results, the government has set clear targets through this Masterplan. First, it aims to extend the Semakau’s landfill lifespan beyond 2035, secondly, it wants to reduce the amount of waste sent to the landfill per capita per day by 30% by 2030 and last to achieve a 70% overall recycling rate by 2030 (81% non-domestic recycling rate and a 30% domestic recycling rate). To meet these targets initiatives have been launched such as: ● the “Say YES to Waste Less” campaign, ● the 3R (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) Awards for Shopping Malls and Hotels, ● the Towards Zero Waste Challenge for schools, ● donation of unsold or excess food to food distribution organisations. To achieve this Masterplan, the Singapore Government has identified three pillars for action: ● Firstly, pushing boundaries through Research and Infrastructure: As part of its Circular Economy deployment plan, some interesting innovations are currently under development. These include: a state of the art Pneumatic Waste Conveyance System that when operational will convey large quantities of reusable wastes throughout the city (mostly underground); the TuasOne waste to energy incineration plant which would be an upgrade from the current primary incinerator; as well as a Pilot Mechanical Biological Treatment Facility. Additionally is the development of a new industrial zone called Tuas Nexus which will comprise of an integrated Waste Management facility and Tuas Water Reclamation Plant to harness synergies across the water-waste-energy nexus. Another significant development is NEWSand, which will make use of incineration bottom ash in construction materials. These initiatives will require significant financing and as part of the Masterplan the authorities have already announced the deployment of SGD 45 million to close the 2025 Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) for (plastics and packaging waste) 2024 Mandatory segregation and treatment regulations for food waste 2019 Zero Waste Master Plan 2021 Mandatory reporting framework for Packaging (including plastics) Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) for e-waste 2016 Climate Change Action Plan 21 waste loop R&D initiative30 (as per 2019, 8 projects worth SGD 20 million have already been funded). Furthermore, they will also be allocating SGD 25 million on the waste to energy programme to test an SGD 40 million waste to energy research facility. ● Secondly, transforming the environmental services industry: the Government foresees that more than 2,000 firms acting in the waste management field will be required to make the Circular Economy possible. To facilitate the transition and development of this new field, 30,000 workers will benefit from the Environmental Services Transformation Map31 by 2025 allowing them to upgrade their skills to meet the new challenges posed by the Circular Economy. Furthermore, the government will also put into place a SGD 30 million Productivity Solutions Grant to assist companies (especially SMEs) to adapt through the transition and last new partnerships will be facilitated to speed-up the Circular Economy under the INCUBATE programme. ● Lastly, co-creating solutions with the community: a series of initiatives have been planned to help communities adapt and become part of the Masterplan. For instance, the Government has launched the “RecycleRight” campaign aiming to educate Singaporeans on adopting better recycling habits, a new design for recycling bins labels has been rolled out to make the segregation at source clearer and more comprehensive, citizen’s workgroup will be created to better address household recycling, consultations of more than 250 companies will be carried out as well as a survey of over 5,000 households to better understand individual recycling habits and finally, more than 1,300 people will participate in public consultations. In Singapore, community involvement and overall people’s mind-set towards recycling is still low and many actions such as these will be required over the next few years to turn this trend around. Waste Management Landscape in Singapore Administrative Landscape Singapore has a well-structured and efficient policy framework and this is relevant in the waste sector as well. When it comes to waste management the highest authority is the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) formerly the Ministry for the Environment and Water Resources or MEWR. The MSE comprises of several agencies including the National Environment Agency (NEA) which deals with all the solid waste matter disposed of in Singapore with the exception of vegetal wastes which are under the National Parks Board (NParks) and certain categories of liquid wastes which fall under the Public Utilities Board (PUB). The roles of key government bodies relevant for Solid Waste Management (SWM) in Singapore, and the implementation of the Mandatory Packaging Reporting Framework under the Resource Sustainability Act are listed as below: Table 1: Singapore Government Waste Management Framework MSE Solid Waste Management framework for implementation of the Resource Sustainability Regulating and administering solid waste management systems in Singapore. 30 Closing the Waste Loop https://www.nea.gov.sg/programmes-grants/grants-and-awards/closing-the-waste-loop-initiative 31 Environmental Services Industry Transformation Map https://www.nea.gov.sg/industry-transformation-map/environmental-services-industry-transformation-map 22 NEA Administration of the Resource Sustainability Act Review packaging data reports submitted by the relevant producers and retailers Support companies in their efforts to reduce packaging waste through: 1) Promoting the sustainable use of resources in supply chains 2) Expending industry capacity in the 3Rs 3) Heightening consumer and industry awareness of packaging waste management Household Waste Disposal The population density cannot be taken out of the picture when considering waste management solutions for Singapore. Indeed, as one of the world’s most densely populated countries (8,358 people per Km2 as opposed to 34 per Km2 in Europe), Singapore needs an efficient and safe waste collection system. One of the early solutions to address this problem was the decision by authorities to incorporate a central chute in all high rise public housings (HDBs) which shelter over 80 % of the resident population. These chutes present on every floor have provided an easy solution to the collection of domestic wastes, and have also safeguarded public hygiene. In its transition from “kampong” living (i.e. traditional rural villages with limited sanitation) to modern high rise building blocks, Singapore has held a large scale successful campaign to encourage residents to put all their disposables in plastic bags and to drop them down these chutes for public workers to collect the wastes daily; it is an effective process but not a sustainable one. In addition to fuelling the linear waste management model, the chute system is also the main reason why plastic bags have not been significantly reduced or even phased-out (2.5 billion32 plastic bags are used on the island every year) as opposed to many other countries like in the EU. This concept has remained in Singapore since, and due to the ease of the practice, it is now posing challenges to transform the public mind-sets to adopt waste segregation at source and overall mindful disposal habits. For this particular reason, education and change of mind-sets towards waste are one of the main challenges that Singapore will have to overcome in its journey towards circularity. Municipal Waste Collection Regarding the manpower required for waste management, it is important to highlight that Singapore is also notably different from the situation in Europe. Until today, most low skills employment in the waste industry such as garbage collection (e.g. collection of household rubbish from HDBs central chutes), cleaning of public places and waste segregation are not done by Singaporeans, but by foreign workers from nearby countries (typically Pakistan and Bangladesh) usually paid on minimum wages to clean up Singapore continuously. That is a very significant waste management workforce to ensure that the city stays clean. A recent study33 pointed out that Singapore employs an army of 58,000 cleaners to clear up the island's housing estates, roads, walkways and waterways three times a day. For this reason, Singapore is currently more accurately a “cleaned city” rather than a “clean city,” a relevant factor recognizing awareness levels and prevailing behaviours amongst the residents of Singapore. Household Recycling in Singapore Singapore introduced the National Recycling Program in 2001 which began with door-to-door collection of recycling bags which eventually evolved to the placement of recycling bins at common areas of residential blocks in 2007. 32Singapore plastic bag usage: https://www.eco-business.com/news/singapore-green-group-calls-for-mandatory-plastic-bag-charge/ 33 Singapore foreign workforce highlight: https://www.eco-business.com/news/singapore-to-give-cleaners-day-off-to-alert-residents-to-citys-waste-problem/#:~:text=Singapore%20employs%20an%20army%20of,be%20given%20the%20day%20off. 23 Although much has been done to facilitate recycling amongst the public, the domestic recycling rate has remained stagnant at around 20% since 2013. In fact, in a commentary published by CNA (Channel News Asia), the national collection-for-recycling effort collected only 2% of household waste, while the local informal recycling sector, which consists of rag pickers and door to door collectors (Karang Gunis), collected close to 20% resulting in the 22% household collection-for-recycling rate. Hence, new strategies are required to achieve the 2030 domestic recycling rate target of 30%. In order to fully understand the household recycling landscape in Singapore it is important to describe the recycling activities conducted in Singapore, before sending the materials for treatment overseas (Singapore is in the process of developing modern recycling facilities using the latest technologies): ● First, the trucks collect the recyclable items around Singapore which have been collected in the blue recycling bins. The trucks then take them to one of Singapore's recycling facilities34 registered under the NEA and operated by public waste collectors where they will unload the items; ● Secondly, the recyclables go through a machine that opens up the bags containing the recyclables and spreads them on a conveyor belt for the first round of manual sorting where workers remove non-recyclable items; ● After this, the recyclables are transported by a conveyor belt and pass below a large magnet where ferrous metals such as drink cans are picked up from the rest; ● The next step sees the remaining recyclables go through a process that segregates two dimensional (e.g. paper) from three-dimensional items (e.g. crushed bottles); ● Following this, the recyclables undergo another round of checks for contamination which involves removing any remaining non-recyclables from the mix (non-recyclables removed at each stage of the process are sent for incineration); ● And last, the recyclables are compacted and packaged for exportation. The below pictures show typical setups at Singapore waste recycling facilities from dumping of the recyclables to manual sorting and compacting (source ZerowasteSG35). 34 Singapore registered recycling facilities: https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/waste-management/3r-programmes-and-resources/collectors-traders-and-local-recycling-facilities 35 Recycling processing facilities http://www.zerowastesg.com/recycle/ 24 Recycling in Singapore Singapore has achieved impressive recycling rates for construction waste as well as ferrous and non-ferrous metals, however, the recycling of other materials such as glass, paper, fabrics and plastics is considerably low. The following realities can be seen as contributing factors and outcomes for this scenario: ● The absence of a recycling industry or mechanical recycling solutions within Singapore ● The heavy reliance on export of recyclables to other countries ● Low levels of segregation of recyclables at the household collection or disposal stage ● Incineration of plastics allows for improved energy recovery To put Singapore’s waste management situation into context the below graphic showcases the relative recycling of different items for 2019 (Source: Zero Waste Masterplan36). In the image below, plastics were indicated to have a recycling rate of only 4%, even lower than the other recyclables such as glass 14% and paper/cardboard at 44%. Singapore’s success with respect to construction waste and the retrieval of ferrous metals is exemplary and can be followed as it attempts to address circularity for food, e-waste and packaging. 36https://www.towardszerowaste.gov.sg/zero-waste-masterplan/chapter2/managing-waste-sustainably/ 25 Graphic 2: Singapore’s Recycling Rates Data Source: NEA37 Challenges for Packaging and Plastics In the absence of a recycling sector with respect to plastics, most of the recyclable materials collected and sorted in Singapore are exported to countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam38. Poor disposal and high levels of contamination in the household recycling stream serves as an impediment to recycling in Singapore. About 40% of the materials suitable for recycling cannot be recycled as it is contaminated by food or liquid and is therefore incinerated. Waste collectors have to bear the cost of collection, storage, and transportation of recyclable materials. Reliance on offshore buyers, import restrictions, and volatile export prices reduce the incentive for the waste sector to collect recyclables in Singapore. Considering the low recycling rate of plastics highlighted above (4%), it is worth taking a closer look to better understand the gaps and potential going forward. Various studies have been conducted in recent years to better understand the local waste landscape. The below graphic shows the outcome of a recent study conducted by the Singapore Environment Council (SEC) and the consulting firm Deloitte: 37 https://www.nea.gov.sg/docs/default-source/default-document-library/waste-recycling-stats-2016-to-2018.pdf 38 Prior to the ban on import of plastic in China, as a result of the National Sword Campaign (January 2018) , China was a popular destination for scrap plastics from Singapore. 26 Graphic 3: Breakdown of plastics consumption in Singapore A study conducted by the Singapore Environment Council and Deloitte found that Singaporeans use 467 million PET bottles per year, 820 million plastic bags per year, and 473 million PP plastics per year. 39 Given the contrast of high plastic consumption on one hand and the very low plastics recycling rates, on the other hand, there is a significant gap in the Singaporean recycling landscape which also means a potential for improvement. Solutions would need to be customized to each of the main categories of plastics (PET, single used plastic bags, and PP), all of which require different approaches and processing techniques, like it has been done in Europe. Currently, in Singapore, the plastic downstream can be summarized as going through the incineration process with energy being extracted in the process and the ash being sent to the landfill. According to the SEC research, the reason for the low plastic recycling rate includes a lack of public awareness of what can be recycled, as well as the limited opportunities for recycling in Singapore. 39 SEC/Deloitte study on plastics https://sec.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DT_PlasticResourceResearch_28Aug2018-FINAL_with-Addendum-19.pdf 27 Graphic 4: Current Singapore Plastic Waste Management Landscape The above graphic provides a partial overview of the plastic waste landscape in Singapore (Source: Singapore Environment Council)40 In terms of what happens to the plastic waste collected to be recycled in Singapore most of it was previously sent to China but following the ban on waste imports this is no longer the case and the waste is now sent to other destinations in Asia. The city-state generated a total of 949,300 tonnes of plastic waste in 2018, of which 40,700 tonnes, or 4.3 per cent, was recycled, according to the NEA. Of the total figure, local exporters sent 37,851 tonnes of plastic abroad while only 2,849 tonnes were processed in Singapore. The remainder of the waste is sent to waste to energy facilities for incineration. Waste to Energy Currently, solid waste disposal infrastructures consist of four waste-to-energy (WTE) plants namely: Tuas Senoko, Tuas South and Keppel Seghers Tuas Waste-To-Energy Plant (KSTP), as well as the Semakau Landfill. Incineration was chosen as the main waste processing method solution so that the volume of solid waste could be reduced by about 90% and sent to the only offshore landfill available. In the process of incinerating, energy derived is reinjected into the national grid contributing to only 2% of the energy mix (most of the energy produced is used to run the incineration plants). In Singapore the vast majority (95%) of the energy is produced by burning natural gas, the remaining is from waste to energy, a very small amount of renewables (photovoltaic) and greenmass41. 40 SEC Plastic Resource Research https://sec.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DT_PlasticResourceResearch_28Aug2018-FINAL_with-Addendum-19.pdf 41 Singapore Energy Mix: https://www.ema.gov.sg/Singapore-Energy-Statistics-2019 28 SOME EXAMPLES OF SINGAPORE’S WASTE MANAGEMENT EFFORTS With a view to improve the current waste to energy capacity but also to diversify the waste processing solutions, Singapore is developing and has introduced numerous efforts ranging from an Integrated Waste Management Facility (IWMF), to a Mechanical Biological Treatment Facility (MBT), a RecycleRight campaign and some others. Each of these solutions is explored as a case study in the section below. This next section highlights some of the case studies relevant to waste management and therefore by extension to the Circular Economy. It is important to note that the efforts emphasize technology, infrastructure, industry partnership, and behaviour change. These reinforce the underlying policy principles of innovation and dynamic urban governance. These efforts also indicate another aspect integral to Singapore’s approach: precautionary testing of solutions before deploying them at a national scale. Examples include the plastic bag fee, the bottle recovery system, the food waste digester, as well as similar approaches in the renewable energy space. Case Study 1 (Infrastructure) Integrated Waste Management Facility, Tuas Nexus (Image source: NEA) An important development in Singapore that will improve the country’s capacity to recycle waste is Tuas Nexus, a SGD 1.5 billion project which will comprise two distinct facilities operating under the jurisdiction of different state agencies: first the Integrated Waste Management Plant42 (IWMP) under the National Environment Agency and secondly a Water Reclamation Plant (WRP) under the Public Utilities Board (PUB). The IWMP will comprise of a Waste to Energy facility capable of treating 2900 tonnes of waste per day and a Material Recovery Facility (MRF) 42 NEA IWMP https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/waste-management/3r-programmes-and-resources/waste-management-infrastructure/integrated-waste-management-facility 29 capable of processing 250 tonnes per day. This MRF module will become one of Singapore’s key technological solutions to the Circular Economy as it will be capable of sorting metals, paper, cardboard and plastics automatically. In addition to power generation, the IWMF will provide several key solid waste treatment processes in an integrated facility to effectively handle various waste streams such as incinerable waste, household recyclables collected under the National Recycling Programme, source-segregated food waste and dewatered sludge from Tuas WRP. Furthermore, its proximity to the WRP facility will make it economically feasible to treat the dewatered sludge from water reclamation (a common practice in Singapore) which will complete the loop of a water-energy-waste nexus. The Tuas Nexus concept marks a significant change of mind-set as most waste projects have previously been developed individually with little or no collaboration between them. However, the Circular Economy will require a much stronger synergy between projects to gain collaborative efficiency. Some concerns surround the fact that enhancing the capacity of waste processing, with a heavy reliance on Waste to Energy treatment will not serve to reduce the generation of waste and that improved Waste to Energy processes may only serve to reduce the amounts of ash heading to landfill, without ensuring a focus on reducing the amounts for incineration. Case Study 2 (Community Engagement) RecycleRight43 campaign The infrastructure for Singaporeans to voluntary recycle their waste is already in place. As a matter of fact, since 2014 every public apartment block (HDBs) has been provided with a recycling bin - up from one bin for every five blocks. There are also dual chutes for refuse and recyclables in all-new HDB flats and non-landed private residential developments. The government recently conducted some studies to investigate the waste segregation habits of Singaporeans and the results show that the collection for recycling rate for the domestic sector only stands at 22%. Furthermore, 40%44 of the domestic waste disposed of in recycling bins cannot be recycled due to contamination. Apart from newspapers which historically have been well collected (but, recently impacted by the drop in paper prices), other items and especially plastics and packaging have a relatively low recycling rate. To improve the waste segregation at source, the Singapore government has launched the RecycleRight campaign under the broader Clean and Green Singapore initiative, a nationwide programme to raise awareness on sustainability. The RecycleRight campaign is built around three easy steps: i) Check: to follow the labels printed on the recycling bins that provide clear instructions on what items can be recycled ii) Clean: encourage people to wash items before disposing them to prevent contamination and iii) Recycle: ongoing disposal of the items in the recycling bins provided. Many public events and community gatherings are already organised surrounding this campaign to spread awareness of good recycling practices within the community. Insights from Industry JTC has an interesting case study that would support the RecycleRight initiative. Four years ago, JTC started to distribute recycling bins to its various partner facilities management companies. At first it was found that the participation and quality of the segregating was poor (i.e. lack of involvement and a high degree of contaminated waste). To turn the trend around, JTC put into place a new initiative called the Green Bonus scheme that returned to the companies as a bonus, any cost savings that resulted from the segregation of the waste. Following this new 43 RecycleRight Campaign https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/transparent-bin-and-other-fresh-ideas-from-public-workgroup-to-help-singapore 44 Recycling contamination https://www.towardszerowaste.sg/recycle-right/ 30 scheme, it turned out that participation and quality significantly improved and remains successful to date. This specific JTC case study highlights a broader trend and one of the main challenges faced by Singapore with regard to recycling. Unless incentives are put in place for people (and companies) to segregate their waste, it is unlikely that it will succeed. Furthermore, it is important to customize the incentives to the targeted groups which may differ significantly in their behaviour triggers. Besides this segregation example, Jurong Island, an artificial island home to the country’s energy and chemicals industry, is set up in such a way that one refinery’s waste stream is another industry’s feedstock. In other words, JTC has designed Jurong Island to apply the Circular Economy by design and within the island’s framework which is a great example of a specific large scale deployment of the Circular Economy concept in Singapore. Learning from this case study to deploy similar concepts at the national level could be a step in the right direction. Case Study 3 (Technology) NEWSand Recycling of Incineration Fly Ash The above image shows a path and a bench made out of NEWSand (Image source NEA) As previously discussed, Singapore’s waste strategy to date has been heavily relying on incineration. Through the process, large amounts of waste ashes are generated and continuously sent to the offshore landfill. To expend its lifetime, an avenue is to significantly reduce the amount of ash sent for disposal. This can be achieved in two ways: firstly by reducing the amount of waste being incinerated in the first place for instance through increased recyclability, and secondly by reusing the ashes for other purposes. NEWSand45 aims to collect the Incineration Bottom Ash (IBA) from the incinerator and to utilise it as raw material for construction-related applications which could include roads, pathways and a range of conventional concrete made items. To date, a pathway and 3D printed concrete projects using NEWSand have been developed and the technology is undergoing research to determine the material strength but also whether any hazardous substances could leak to the environment after storm events. As Singapore is uniquely using much of the island as an urban rainwater catchment area, this is potentially an issue that will need to be closely monitored. 45 NEWSand NEA initiative: https://www.nea.gov.sg/media/news/news/index/newsand-a-key-to-closing-singapore-s-waste-loop 31 Case Study 4 NEWOil While still in the early stages of development, Singapore wants to create NEWOil46 by perfecting a process to give discarded plastic new life in the form of pyrolysis oil - a potential replacement for the fossil fuel petroleum. To harness this new source of oil from plastic waste, the country will need to develop its chemical recycling industry, including establishing a pilot plant that will help anchor the chemical recycling value chain. NEWOil is an interesting project because it would add a new angle to the plastic waste issue and provide another avenue to value them. It would also make it possible to recycle plastics that are not currently included in recycling chains such as contaminated plastics, single used plastics or even plastic bags through a chemical plastic recycling process rather than conventional mechanical means. While these solutions are still being developed and are yet to be commercially viable or scaled, the innovation efforts can contribute to exploring solutions for plastics. In addition to contributing to the plastic problem, NEWOil would also help tackle other issues such as energy dependency (Oil) and Climate Change (reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions). Neste, the Finnish oil refining company, is one of these companies actively looking into such products. At the end of 2018, Neste made an investment decision of 1.4 billion euros to expand the Singapore refinery, which will increase Neste’s renewable products47 production capacity by 1.3 million tonnes/year, bringing the total global renewable product capacity close to 4.5 million tonnes/year when the expansion is completed in 2022. There could be a strong avenue for partnership between such European companies willing to invest heavily in Singapore and the Singapore Government with regards to the Circular Economy. Case Study 5 (Technology) Singapore’s Pneumatic Waste Conveyance System (PWCS) Image: PWCS system (source HDB) Singapore has provided an efficient and easy central chute system for waste disposal in high rise buildings which however requires significant maintenance such as regular cleaning of the chutes to avoid pest proliferation. In Singapore, the ease of disposing of recyclable items has been linked to the recycling rate. In the earlier public buildings, a single chute was incorporated into every flat, which dissuaded people from going to the basement to dispose of the recyclable items in separate bins. However, newer building designs have shifted to a common floor 46 NEWoil Straightimes article https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/after-newater-look-out-for-newoil-newsand 47 Neste renewable products: https://www.neste.sg/neste-in-singapore-and-asia-pacific/who-we-are/production/singapore 32 chute and added a separate one for recyclables which have resulted in improving the domestic recycling rates significantly, as mentioned above. The PWCS48 is a cleaner automated waste collection system that uses a vacuum-type vertical and underground pipe network to collect household waste, which is then transported to a sealed container. Trucks then periodically collect the waste for disposal. The entire waste collection process is automated, thereby reducing manpower requirements and increasing productivity. Through the PWCS, separation of the waste for recycling will be made more efficient in addition to a more hygienic waste collection process. Case Study 6 (Technology) Mechanical Biological Treatment Facility Another significant technology addition to boosting Singapore’s waste management solution could be the Mechanical Biological Treatment Facility49 (MBT). This will be one of only ten such facilities in Asia using next-generation technology. Typically MBT projects have three treatment components: i) extraction of the recyclables such as metals and plastics through mechanical sorting ii) the remaining waste is converted into solid recovered fuel (SRF) through biological treatment and iii) energy can be produced from the SRF with greater efficiency than if the waste was incinerated without treatment. The pilot plant will be able to process around 300 tonnes per day of domestic waste. As Singapore disposes of about 4,500 tonnes per day of domestic waste, such a plant should be able to handle around 7% of the domestic waste. Case Study 7 (Industry Partnership) INCUBATE Programme Initiated by the National Environment Agency (NEA), the Innovating and Curating Better Automation and Technologies for Environmental Services (INCUBATE) programme embodies the partnership between the technology providers and services providers, premises owners, and the government, to collectively innovate and curate better technologies, solutions and innovations for the Environmental Services industry. Through this partnership, the various stakeholders for the private premises will be able to collaborate with NEA in the following areas: identify challenge statements of common interest in the areas of environmental services; conduct trials for technology, solutions and innovations to address challenge statements, and study the feasibility of wide-scale adoption in their respective premises; coordinate efforts and participate in joint projects to address challenge statements; share information and learnings from the trials; and execute viable technologies, solutions and innovations in their respective premises when ready. While still in its early stage of deployment, some INCUBATE projects already explore the implementation of technology such as smart bins and food waste digesters (for instance JTC has been testing food waste digesters on their properties) to increase productivity and reduce costs. Automations, smart systems (e.g. artificial intelligence) and robotics applied to recycling could significantly improve recovery rates and the INCUBATE programme promises to deliver interesting innovative solutions leveraging Singapore's strong research in this field. It is interesting to note that an avenue to improve the Circular Economy is also to partner with other leading research fields in Singapore where the government is investing significantly including Biotechnology and Information Technology. 48 HDB PWCS: https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/about-us/our-role/smart-and-sustainable-living/hdb-greenprint/waste-management 49 NEA MBT project: http://www.zerowastesg.com/tag/mbt/ 33 Case Study 8 (Industry Partnership) ALBA W&H Smart City Alba Group, a Berlin-based environmental solutions company, partnered with Singapore company Wah & Hua (W&H) to drive waste management solutions in Singapore. The consortium has won a contract to provide public waste collection services within the Jurong region. Alba W&H has integrated sustainable, digital, and productive environmental solutions into its waste collection systems. For example, Alba W&H is adding fully electric waste collection trucks to its fleet to reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions. Sensors will also be installed in some waste containers to monitor refuse level to enable greater efficiency in waste collection. Case Study 9 (Industry Partnership) Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City (SSTEC) Another example is the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City (SSTEC), a government-to-government project between Singapore and China. Designated as a pilot zero-waste city, novel zero-waste environmental solutions and initiatives will be explored within the SSTEC to establish a replicable zero waste reference model for other Chinese cities/areas. Case Study 10 (Skills Development) Environmental Services Industry Transformation Map The Environmental Services Industry Transformation Map, which will enable about 30,000 people from the industry to benefit from higher-value jobs through skills upgrading and technology adoption by 2025. To prepare the industry to meet the new challenges, ES ITM was launched in December 2017 to transform the industry with higher productivity and capabilities to meet future challenges. NEA launched the Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG) in Sep 2018 to support companies to adopt commercially available and proven ES technologies, such as plastic recycling systems as well as tonnage monitoring solutions, to achieve operational efficiency and productivity while reducing manpower reliance. Case Study (Pilot Testing) Plastic Bag Fees Singapore has a long history of trying soft measures to convince customers to limit their usage at supermarket outlets. It is common in Singapore for people to use double bags (usually not necessary) on grocery items which reflects a plastic bag overuse culture that needs to change. It can be said that Singapore is one of the countries with the highest plastic bag usage; indeed the numbers are revealing: 820 million plastic bags used in Singapore supermarkets alone every year for a population of fewer than 6 million people. Measures to limit the usage of plastic bags included the “Bring Your Own Bag Day” campaign by the Singapore Environment Council (SEC) or more recently small fees (SGD 0.10 per bag) charged for plastic bags at a few supermarket outlets. Often these initiatives have resulted in mixed feelings among the community as it undermines a bigger problem which is the replacement solution to dispose 34 of household waste down the chutes.50 Responding to the community’s reluctance to switch, the fees have now been withdrawn. While there has been a lot of debate and criticisms surrounding the use of plastic bags in Singapore the alternatives have been considered and the challenges raised are that degradable bags are not viewed as beneficial when waste is incinerated not composted, and the life cycle costs of single-use paper and degradable bags are not attractive. Case Study (Pilot Testing) Reverse Vending Machines The Recycle N Save initiative by NEA and F&N Foods Pte Ltd, where 50 smart Reverse Vending Machines have been rolled out across Singapore to offer members of the public a convenient and rewarding way to return their used beverage containers. After an overwhelming response to the initial rollout of 16 machines offering SGD 0.20 for four(4) beverage containers and noting that machines were unable to handle the volumes, 34 additional machines have been introduced with the incentive dropping to SGD 0.20 for 20 beverage containers. The bottles thus collected enter the sorted plastics stream and eventually exported for treatment. Case Study (Research) Plastic Waste Related Research Singapore has stepped up its research activities on how to make better use of waste and especially plastics. There are a range of ongoing research projects in Singapore laboratories, some which have already come up with promising results: ● For instance, scientists from NUS (the National University of Singapore) and the Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology (SIMTech) have converted polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles into a highly insulating and absorbent material called “aerogel”51. It is the first time an aerogel has been made from PET, the same plastic used for water and soft drink bottles. Their possible real-life applications include: serving as a lining for fire-retardant coats and carbon dioxide absorption masks that could be used during a fire; better heat and sound insulation in buildings; and cleaning oil spills. ● A second example is research conducted by NTU (Singapore’s National Technological University) that converts52 plastics into useful chemicals using sunlight. In laboratory experiments, the research team mixed plastics with their catalyst in a solvent, which allows the solution to harness light energy and convert the dissolved plastics into formic acid - a chemical used in fuel cells to produce electricity. ● Besides technologies to reduce plastics, a better understanding of the impacts is also required. Another example to highlight that Singapore is strengthening its plastic research is a new partnership created between the UK and Singapore. Singapore’s National Research Foundation (NRF) and the UK’s Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) are collaborating on research projects under the “Understanding the Impact of Plastic Pollution on Marine Ecosystems in South East Asia” (South East Asia Plastics SEAP) programme. The aim of the programme is to support collaborations between researchers in the UK, Singapore, and the wider South East Asian region to increase understanding of the impacts and risks of plastics in marine 50 SEC study on plastic bags https://www.sec.org.sg/byobe/files/SEC_Position_Paper_on_Reducing_Plastic_Bag_Wastage_in_Singapore.pdf 51Singapore aerogel technology: https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/made-singapore-solution-world-plastic-waste-problem-aerogel-nus-11072016 52NTU plastic research: https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-12/ntu-nss121119.php 35 ecosystems (including mangroves, coral reefs and beaches) and the essential services these ecosystems provide, in order to support the development of mitigation measures. Case Study (Alternative materials) Single-Use Plastic Alternatives Many small businesses have been established to develop alternatives to Single-Use Plastics. These include plant-based plastics that are biodegradable (Bio-Pak), services that use returnable containers that provide alternative delivery models (e.g. barePack53). The World Wildlife Fund’s Alternative Materials Tool (AMT)54 is intended to aid food and beverage retailers to make conscious decisions on single-use packaging where reuse is not an option. And several other examples, most still at the experimental stage, show that Singapore has stepped up its research activity in terms of finding innovative solutions to the waste problem. Usually, it takes many years before such innovations reach the market place and this can be expected to happen within the decade. SUMMARY OF SINGAPORE WASTE MANAGEMENT EFFORTS Singapore is in the process of significantly improving its infrastructure with state of the art waste processing facilities which are diverse in nature covering: waste to energy, recyclables segregation and plastics processing as well as biological treatment. Each of these efforts reflects a carefully considered approach to identifying innovative solutions to waste. Early developments in Singapore and notably the implementation of a central chute in households combined with a mass plastic bags disposal campaign have created a situation where it has become too easy to dispose of waste without segregation and shifted public interest in the matter. Going forward, concurrently to new technological solutions implementation, changing mind-sets towards recycling is a major challenge for Singapore. The current recycling landscape in Singapore shows a great recycling disparity between categories of items. In general, construction related wastes are very well taken care of (close to 99% recycling) but on the other hand items such as plastics (only 4%), glass and textile products have very low or comparatively (e.g. ASEAN) low recycling rates. This significant disparity highlights that more needs to be done but also points to the fact that Singapore has the potential to be a performant recycling nation by leveraging its construction waste successes and applying it to the other items along with new solutions. Furthermore, from these solutions highlights, it appears that Singapore’s strategy towards a more Circular Economy is currently more focused on technological inputs. Indeed, the vast majority of the funds (e.g. 1.5 billion for the IWMF) are allocated to the construction of major waste processing facilities while significantly less on other aspects of the waste stream. A combination of significant research (e.g. NTU, NUS) and foreign companies investments (e.g. Neste) in relation to the Circular Economy (especially plastics) is helping build up capacity for a new framework prone to the deployment of the Circular Economy in Singapore. 53https://www.barepack.co/ 54https://www.wwf.sg/?uNewsID=364677 36 SINGAPORE AND BROADER ASIAN CONTEXT To fully understand the potential for Circular Economy adoption and opportunities that the EU could seek with Singapore it is also important to understand how the Circular Economy concept has been spreading across Asia and Singapore’s role within this regional trend. A Circular Economy model is not only sought by Singapore but by several other countries in the region. While the situation varies between countries, all are facing significant waste challenges (with some being more urgent than others), marked by huge surges in the volumes of e-waste and packaging waste which is pushing these countries to increasingly pursue the Circular Economy path. As with other emerging trends, such a pursuit has become more than just finding solutions to the waste problem, but also an opportunity for thought leadership. For instance, the Chinese government embarked on its Circular Economy journey as early as 2002 as a way to approach its urgent problems of environmental degradation and resource scarcity. China’s Circular Economy grew by 15 % annually between 2006 and 2010 and reached 1.8 trillion yuan in 2015. Furthermore, a report by the Fung Global Institute and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation55, notes that China has the potential to lead the adoption of circular economies in Asia, and possibly globally. This report highlights three important points regarding the evolution and specific challenges faced by the Circular Economy in Asia compared to the rest of the world: ● China and Asia are experiencing rapid economic growth. This is accompanied by rapid urbanization, infrastructure development, strains on natural resources and pollution challenges. The speed of development makes it difficult to ensure that comprehensive planning is taking place, and at the same time, it offers tremendous potential for leapfrogging to a circular system, learning from the experience of other markets and avoiding getting locked into a linear model. ● The policy and regulatory frameworks of China and Asia present further barriers and opportunities. Trade policies, particularly those relating to used and remanufactured goods, in some cases prevent the flow of valuable goods because they are not treated as potential resources or inputs. ● Asia presents a diversity of cultures. An approach that is successful in one part of the region cannot always be applied to another. The region’s history and civilizations also set it apart from the EU at some cultural levels, which could, for example, impact consumer preferences. These differences should be acknowledged and taken into account. The Circular Economy is not new in Asia and has been happening for many years. In recent years, ASEAN Member States have commenced efforts both at the regional and national level to identify tools and interventions to address the growing issue of plastics in the marine environment. These interventions include Circular Economy policies and instruments. Most recently, the ASEAN Framework of Action on Marine Debris was developed to act on the recommendations from the ASEAN Conference on Reducing Marine Debris in ASEAN Region in Phuket in November 2017. On 5 March 2019, the ASEAN Member States announced the Framework of Action on Marine Debris in Bangkok, Thailand. This Framework comprises four (4) priority areas namely: (i) Policy Support and Planning; (ii) Research, Innovation, and Capacity Building; (iii) Public Awareness, Education, and Outreach; and (iv) Private Sector Engagement. Each priority area consists of actions and suggested activities for further collaboration in the ASEAN region and among ASEAN and its partners in combating marine debris.56 A recent collaboration between the European Union and ASEAN has resulted in the publication of the work57 “Circular Economy and plastics: a 55 CE in Asia report https://www.asiaglobalinstitute.hku.hk/storage/app/media/pdf/Circular-economy_tnv3.pdf 56 https://asean.org/storage/2019/06/3.-ASEAN-Framework-of-Action-on-Marine-Debris-FINAL.pdf 57 ASEAN/EU case study: https://environment.asean.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Circular-Economy-gap-analysis-final.pdf 37 gap analysis in ASEAN member states”.

As such, plastic waste is considered a high priority issue. Although the Ministry of Interior has led efforts to promote source separation of waste at the community level, a major obstacle is the continued contamination of low-quality waste plastics such as plastic bags. Even if future recycling activities are promoted, the relatively low value of these materials, coupled with Thailand’s lack of an existing market to absorb increasing volumes of collected waste will continue to pose challenges. Singapore despite being the smallest country in ASEAN has an important role to play in the deployment of the Circular Economy in the region. First, it is a small but wealthy country with a GDP of 364.2 billion USD (2018) more than any other nation (except Brunei) in ASEAN and as a result, it has the financial resources to take risks and to invest in new infrastructures, research and development necessary to fuel the Circular Economy development. Secondly, Singapore has a stable and effective government structure where policy changes can happen faster than other parts of Asia. Lastly, Singapore is often seen as a model in Asia when it comes to public policies and innovations. Successful initiatives that start in Singapore are likely to be either adopted in their current form with a Singapore branding as a mark of quality or to inspire similar actions as ASEAN countries' own initiatives. Some recent examples of this include the Singapore Green Mark Scheme and the Singapore Eco-label. The role that Singapore has to play 39 on the Circular Economy in Asia can be compared to what is expected for the Climate Change crisis: countries in the region expect Singapore to act first because of its economic attributes and setting. The status of current Circular Economy policies and frameworks present in ASEAN is provided in the Appendix. The most important point to highlight about the development of the Circular Economy in Asia is that all countries have different situations with their own strengths and weaknesses. It is therefore of mutual interest that ASEAN economies start working together to lift existing barriers at the regional level and overcome these challenges by learning and supporting one another. A good example of this is the recently created Asia Plastics and Packaging Agreement 205058 which aims for stronger collaboration within the region on the Circular Economy. To address this gap, the following sections will explore in greater details where the opportunities are beyond just technology adoptions and provide a detailed waste management comparative analysis between the EU and Singapore. 1.4 ADVANCING THE CASE FOR CIRCULAR ECONOMY IN SINGAPORE The first two sections have provided specific insights on the Circular Economy contexts in both the EU and Singapore. In order to identify more opportunities and emit recommendations, the next sections of the report will focus on comparative analysis. The table below highlights some of the key building blocks for the Circular Economy in both Singapore and the EU while identifying the opportunities to improve and advance this approach in Singapore. Table 2: Comparison of Singapore and EU Contexts Areas of Opportunity Singapore Context EU Context Policy Integration Singapore has recently developed the Zero Waste Masterplan which invokes Circular Economy principles. However, these principles are seen to apply to the waste collection and disposal mechanisms, solely. The Resource Sustainability Act provides the legal framework for enacting and enforcing EPR and other regulations. A broader, more comprehensive framework which contemplates aspects such as source reduction, design, reduced consumption, recycling targets and landfill bans remains to be developed. The EU’s new Circular Economy Action Plan within the European Green Deal and earlier Circular Economy Packages reflect a committed attempt to introduce and ensure a Circular Economy in the EU. The EU has created and continuously further develops a legal framework, in this regard. It consists of specific Directives such as: • EU Waste Framework Directive (2008/98/EC). • EU Directive 94/62/EC on Packaging and Packaging Waste • EU Directive 2019/904 on the reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment. (entered into force in June 2019) • EU Directive 2012/19/EU on waste electrical and electronic equipment. OPPORTUNITY 1: Singapore could embrace a more comprehensive approach to the Circular Economy by enhancing its Zero Waste Master Plan while also benefiting from the refinements introduced by the EU. The shared goals of resource efficiency and climate resilience would also further the dialogue between the EU and Singapore. Underlying Principles (Waste Hierarchy) While Singapore’s waste management framework acknowledges the 3R principles and more recently the reduced waste approach, there is still a bias towards incineration and not a clear preference for a waste The waste hierarchy is embedded in the early EU Directives and further emphasised in the more recent ones. The reliance on offshore recycling, limited treatment at 58 APPA https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EZvp_sxPxOw1o8of6Rd2aqKYA40MuZrx/view 40 hierarchy that prioritizes reduction, reuse and recycling before recovery and incineration. An emphasis on resilience is clearly preferred- and all measures must align with its need to remain attractive to businesses maintaining its economic independence. source and reuse efforts are now being revisited in the more recent strategies. OPPORTUNITY 2: Singapore could re-examine the waste hierarchy and identify examples and opportunities from the EU to introduce greater emphasis and interventions at the reducing, reuse and recycling stages. Recognising the shared challenges of offshore recycling, both the EU and Singapore are in a good position to identify regional collaborations that are well supported and less vulnerable to political and business risks. Opportunities to explore innovative recycling infrastructure is another area of collaboration. Plastics Focussed Strategies Even while acknowledging the challenge of plastics, to date Singapore has been overall quite weak on plastics waste policies (for instance compared to other ASEAN countries such as Thailand). Plastic bag charges have been applied with only limited success and withdrawn on cultural factors basis (e.g. reliance on hawker centres for meals and hence the extensive use of single use plastics) are often cited as going against a strict ban on single use plastics. With only 4% of collected plastics being recycled and the remainder (as much as 96%) sent for incineration, recycling policies are also lacking. Furthermore, there are currently no policies (or public discussions) in Singapore with respect to microplastics even though plastic leakage to the environment which eventually ends up becoming microplastics entering food chains is a major issue in Asia. Europe has been much stronger on plastic recycling than Singapore. Of Europe’s 25 million tonnes of plastic waste: 30% is recycled, 39 % is incinerated and 31% goes to landfill. In 2020 new rules will be proposed to ensure that by 2030 all plastic packaging in the EU market will be either reusable or recyclable. The EU Directive on the reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment, which entered into force in June 2019, includes the following policy instruments: ● Restrictions on placing on the market (“bans”) of cutlery (forks, knives, spoons, chopsticks); plates; straws; beverage stirrers; cups, food and beverage containers made of expanded polystyrene; cotton bud sticks; sticks for balloons by July 2021. ● Consumption reduction: EU member states can choose between different instruments to quantitatively reduce the consumption of certain single-use plastic products between 2022 and 2026 ● Product design requirements: By July 2024, caps and lids need to remain attached to bottles to avoid their leakage into the environment. By 2025, PET bottles need to contain at least 25% of recycled plastics. By 2030, all kinds of single-use plastic bottles need to contain at least 30% of recycled plastics. ● Marking requirements: Through harmonised labels on products and packaging, consumers will be informed about the presence of plastics in the product, how it should be disposed of and what negative environmental impacts would arise from littering. ● Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR): EPR obligations are extended to food and beverage containers as well as packets and wrappers for immediate consumption on-the-spot or takeaway; cups for beverages including caps and lids; lightweight plastic carrier bags; wet wipes and balloons, tobacco products with filters ● Separate collection: The Directive introduces a new separate collection target for plastic beverage bottles: 77% by 2025 and 90% by 2029. ● Awareness raising: Consumers should be informed about reusable alternatives to single-use plastics and how to correctly dispose of their waste. They should also be informed about negative environmental impacts of 41 littering and improper disposal. The same applies for users of fishing gear. The EU Plastic Strategy of 2018 envisages that by 2030 all plastic packaging in the EU market will be either reusable or recyclable. The EU plans for the development of new Micro-plastic Policies and is in the process of conducting EU-wide surveys. OPPORTUNITY 3: A strong plastics focus could be introduced to adapt the EU Directives as necessary for the Singapore context, prioritizing more challenging aspects, such as progressively reducing single use plastics production and consumption, reducing packaging waste and increasing the recovery of packaging and other plastics. Using the EU approaches of quantifying and identifying the most challenging types/ forms of plastics would be beneficial to Singapore. Economic Opportunity A fourfold increase in plastic reuse and recycling by 2030 could generate US 60 billion in profit for the petrochemical and plastics sector according to a global study59. Preliminary studies have estimated that Singapore could reach a net benefit of 40 million by recovering and reusing materials from e-waste alone. A Circular Economy approach will also provide new economic opportunities by creating synergies and job creations. Applying Circular Economy principles across the EU economy have the potential to increase EU GDP by an additional 0.5 % by 2030 creating 700,000 new jobs. Individual companies spend on average 40% on materials; there is therefore a significant cost reduction potential to adopt circularity.60 Social and environmental costs are being internalized into products which will require discussions with authorities. OPPORTUNITY 4: Given the focus on economic independence and maintaining its status as an attractive base for businesses, identifying economic and business opportunities through circularity would be paramount in the Singapore context. Studies and findings that substantiate this effect from the EU would be very useful. Circular Economy in Production and Design Source Reduction The Singapore Packaging Agreement mentions an intent to reduce the amount of plastic waste in packaging. Design for Reuse/ Repair In Singapore: there are currently no regulations to oblige manufacturers to design their products more sustainably outside of the voluntary Eco-label efforts. The EU will propose a Sustainable Product Policy Legislative Initiative. Circular Economy in Consumption Another opportunity for partnership is that there is a clear lack of ‘Repair Culture” in Singapore where dysfunctional items are usually thrown away rather than fixed (this is not the case in other ASEAN countries which reuse and repair items to a much greater extent- Singapore is still predominantly a linear consumer centric society). The EU will also implement a “Right to Repair” policy. In the EU, Public Authorities purchasing power represents 14 % of EU GDP and can serve as a powerful driver for the demand for sustainable products. To tap into this potential, the EU Commission will prepare a minimum mandatory Green Public Procurement criteria and targets sectoral legislation. It will also phase in compulsory reporting to monitor the uptake of GPP. The EU could learn from the Singapore Green Mark Scheme especially for the built environment and construction sectors. Circular Economy in Waste Management Singapore has a centralized waste collection system, which is implemented by several private waste companies. They follow the government established protocols for waste collection and disposal including the dual bin system (a blue bin for recyclables and a green The EU Member States have successfully enforced the collection of recyclables in separate streams engaging with municipal and private waste collectors. 59https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/chemicals/our-insights/how-plastics-waste-recycling-could-transform-the-chemical-industry# 60https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_420 42 bin for common waste). Unlike in some EU countries which have separate individual containers, all recyclables are disposed of in the same bin often leading to contamination. Disposal Behaviour: In Singapore more than 80% of the population lives in high rise apartment blocks with a central chute waste disposal system which further reduces the incentive to separate and segregate. Low awareness levels and a reluctance to be inconvenienced suggest that behaviour change is a critical missing component. Circular Economy in Recycling Offshoring: Singapore has been affected by the China ban on waste exports which has shifted its plastic recycling logistics. It is important to highlight that Singapore is a major shipping hub and could play a role in the EU waste shipment regulatory formulations especially because many of the countries where the EU have been exporting their wastes are within ASEAN (e.g. Indonesia). Furthermore, the EU mind-set shift of wanting to value waste by transforming them into usable raw materials may create a waste export market for Singapore. A mutually beneficial trade agreement could be inked for this purpose. Infrastructure: Singapore is still to date predominantly dealing with its waste through an incineration process. Some recycling facilities are in place but currently not sufficient to develop a Circular Economy. At the current waste disposal rates, Singapore would need to build a new incineration plant every 7 to 10 years. However, Singapore is in the process of developing several high-end waste processing facilities and new infrastructures that will give a significant boost to the existing recycling capacity. Concurrently to developing these new facilities, Singapore is also trying to develop synergies between them; an experience it is currently lacking. For many years, the EU has been exporting a significant amount of untreated wastes to third world countries. However, going forward the EU has made clear in its recent reports that it will ensure to no longer export its waste challenges to third countries and promote a “recycle in the EU” branding instead. To do this the EU will implement rules on wastes shipment. OPPORTUNITY 5: The EU and Singapore could collaborate in establishing and improving upon the collection of recyclables and to identify opportunities for recycling both locally and regionally. While the EU has considerable expertise with separate waste collection for recycling, many Member States may find themselves in a situation not too different from Singapore when looking for local recycling infrastructure and technology as well as regional offshoring potential. Therefore learning from this process would also benefit the EU. (*this point is elaborated further in the note on recycling capability below) 43 Circular Economy Instruments Singapore’s Extended Producer Responsibility will cover packaging by 2025. It is however lacking the expertise to do so and therefore there is an imminent need for collaboration in preparation for 2025 frameworks. The EU has much knowhow on EPR to transfer to Singapore. Furthermore, Singapore is planning for a mandatory reporting framework for packaging. In Singapore, reporting has been found to improve actions for instance sustainability reporting made mandatory in 2018 for SGX listed companies is already showing signs of greater voluntary corporate actions. Singapore has started to testbed DRS systems in NTUC supermarkets. Initial findings seem to indicate low participation and high contamination rates and that much more would need to be done to make DRS a mainstream reality in Singapore. The EPR instruments and DRS systems have been adopted across multiple Member States and the merits and demerits of each of the variations have been well recorded. Advanced reporting schemes have also been established both by government led and privately run producer responsibility organizations (PROs). OPPORTUNITY 6: The EU could support Singapore in further deepening its EPR expertise. The varied use of EPR and other strategies to address plastics and packaging waste in the EU offer not only different approaches to enforcing these regulations but also the challenges to be anticipated and avoided. For e.g. Singapore’s EPR regulation with respect to E-waste calls on experts from Netherlands and Norway. It has already been established that there will be only one PRO in operation (thus avoiding the competitive models seen in some EU countries). Secondary Markets and GPP Secondary Market: A market for secondary raw materials is not well developed in Singapore. There is much room for improvement in this aspect. Green Public Procurement (GPP): Singapore’s broader GPP policy can be tapped into to support increased circularity. The EU intends to create a well-functioning EU market for secondary raw materials through: requirements for recycled content, enhanced standardization, restrictions on substances of very high concern and creating a market observatory for key secondary materials. OPPORTUNITY 7: Even as the EU advances its efforts in establishing markets for secondary raw materials (or recycled materials) and adds greater emphasis to the offtake of green goods through mandatory green procurement targets, Singapore too is on the cusp of expanding its green procurement policy. It is an opportune timing to explore potential policy standards that could also be extended throughout the region. Innovation and Research Singapore has strong research facilities and there could be multiple elements of plastic research partnerships with the EU. It is noteworthy that Singapore also has a highly developed oil and gas (and plastic) industry which can help in advancing circular solutions for plastics. Singapore has plans to set up an INCUBATE programme to help with waste innovations. Besides its Circular Economy masterplan, the Singapore Government is also investing in IT technologies. Another avenue to implement the Circular Economy is to link or connect to prominent sectors already receiving research funding such as biotechnology, IT and water. By leveraging on other fields, it would become much easier to have access to grants and funding for the Circular Economy. 44 NEA recently conducted a series of workshops61 and the SEC produced a report on developing the local plastic recycling62 industry and is planning (refer to the case studies in section 2.2) a deeper dive into various recycling solutions. For example, mechanical recycling to turn waste plastic into plastic pellets for manufacturing new products or chemical recycling to turn plastic waste into chemical feedstock or fuel. OPPORTUNITY 8: Singapore has invested heavily in its research and development capabilities and has a very strong preference for innovation. Sharing of research and collaborating on new research would be an important opportunity to liaise with the EU. Regulatory Framework Regulatory Framework: Singapore has been well recognised for its well-developed regulatory framework especially with respect to monitoring and enforcement on other policy issues. Such an environment ensures the success of well-considered policies and measures. Fees: Singapore has a strong taxation framework already in place on many aspects such as carbon (recently implemented) and transportation. The implementation of a plastic tax could well work in Singapore through a progressive approach. OPPORTUNITY 9: The advanced regulatory framework in Singapore allows for exploring potential adaptations of successful EU regulations paving the way for a more harmonized global approach. OPPORTUNITY FOR ENGAGEMENT Each of the opportunities identified above to advance the case for the Circular Economy in Singapore provide for engagement with the EU. The form of engagement could vary in accordance with the degree of expertise and advancement in the field within the EU and in Singapore. Below are main areas where opportunities for bilateral partnerships could be advanced: Policy Cooperation: Addressing policy gaps especially where the EU has experience or expertise will advance the policy dialogue, and has the potential to support the development of strategies and solutions. Innovation Collaboration: In contrast, where neither the EU nor Singapore have an established track record, there lies an opportunity to co-innovate and advance a combined effort. Standardisation: In the instance where both Singapore and the EU have a sufficiently rigorous approach, the form of engagement can be one that allows for aligning of standards and harmonization. Learnings/Sharing: Where the EU has limited expertise, but Singapore has made advances (especially when it comes to innovation) there lies the opportunity to share learnings and a potential for deeper understanding of Singapore’s success. 61 NEA Plastic Management Workshop https://www.nea.gov.sg/docs/default-source/envision/plastic-waste-management-in-singapore.pdf 62 SEC Plastic recycling study https://sec.org.sg/seaa/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SEC-Plastic-Resource-Study-Paper_Final1.pdf 45 Graphic 5: Opportunities in Context The above diagram puts the proposed opportunities into context drawing from the strengths and weaknesses of both geographies. It is clear that some opportunities are drawn from bilateral strength while others would utilize the strength of one geography (Singapore or the EU) to fill a weakness in the other (e.g. The EU is much stronger on plastic strategies than Singapore at this stage). Note on Recycling Capability: As pointed out in ”Opportunity 5” an avenue where the EU and Singapore could clearly learn from one another is the regional nature of the recycling framework. Currently, Singapore collects the recyclable wastes, sorts and packages them before sending them for processing overseas. While most of the recyclables used to be sent to China, this is no longer the case following a ban on imports and now new markets need to be developed within ASEAN which explains (among other reasons) why the recycling rates have reduced in recent years (i.e. a transition period). Currently, there are no clear and transparent processes nor regulations to select overseas recycling processing partners. This decision is left to the Singapore waste contractors to decide individually. The introduction of certifications is useful in this regard. For example, EuCertPlast for a certification approach of plastic recycling companies within and outside of the EU.63 There are also some few certified recyclers in China and Malaysia. It is understood that such decisions are business oriented to maximize the profit and as such the most economical and logistically advantageous solutions are favoured which usually means exports within close proximity (e.g. Johor in Malaysia or nearby Indonesian islands) and cheapest processing options. It is worth noting that due to this economical pressure and absence of guidance, decisions on the choice of overseas recycling facilities are not necessarily the best in terms of efficiency and efficacy (i.e. the waste may not end up being appropriately recycled overseas). With new high end technologies and processing facilities being developed in Singapore it is expected that the recycling landscape will shift to become more and more localized rather than depending on exports. However, as it will take some time for Singapore to become self-sufficient, new policies and/or frameworks with regards to the trade of recyclable wastes within the region could be looked at beyond just safety measures which are well taken care of (e.g. trade of hazardous waste). 63 https://www.eucertplast.eu/ 46 The EU is facing a similar dilemma, for many years it has relied on export to process parts of its recyclable waste including exports to countries in Asia. However, following the tightening of regulations and bans on waste imports by several countries it is now forced to treat the waste within the EU. SUMMARY ON THE EU/SINGAPORE CONTRASTS When comparing Singapore and the EU it becomes apparent that both geographies are clearly targeting Circular Economy but are on different paths that sometimes converge and other times don’t. The comparison highlights the fact that both geographies have strengths and weaknesses. For instance, Singapore's strength relies on the stability of its legislative system and the ease to enforce change. Singapore also has the means to invest in significant infrastructures but on the other hand, it needs a nation-wide mind-set change to shift attitudes towards recycling. The EU main strengths rely on a longer period of adoption of a legal waste management framework which provides a strong basis for continuous evolution based on trial and error. Collaborating with the EU on the Circular Economy, Singapore could save years of trial and errors by leapfrogging innovations and implementation proved frameworks, policies and technologies. In Singapore, it is clear that the shift to a circular economy will not occur through the actions of the private sector or communities alone but that the Government will have to step in to force a change through regulations. To this regard, learning from the EU will certainly be beneficial in identifying the most successful regulatory instruments. 47 SECTION 2 EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY 48 EPR IN THE EU AND SINGAPORE 2.1 EPR IN THE EU Extended Producer Responsibility is a policy instrument where producers are given significant responsibility, financial and/or physical, for the collection, sorting and recycling or environmentally sound treatment of the products and/or packaging they put on the market after consumer use. Since the introduction of the EPR approach in Europe in the early 1990s, and in particular over the past 15 years, it has been quite a popular approach with over 400 EPR schemes currently in use globally, many of them in EU countries. Graphic 6: Adoption trend of EPR in the EU Cumulative global EPR policy adoption over time (Source: Kaffine and O’Reilly, 2015). Such schemes promote circularity by encouraging producers to design their products and packaging in a manner that it has an end of life value. Producers would also be best suited to identify closed-loop solutions, which would mean that they are able to utilise the material value recovered from their products within their manufacturing processes. Furthermore, EPR schemes ensure industry participation in the waste management challenges and could take the form of fees, deposit-refund systems, voluntary or mandatory take-back schemes etc. According to the categorisation provided by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development), four broad categories of EPR instruments have served as a backbone to Europe’s EPR strategy: ● First, “product take-back requirements” which commonly involve establishing either mandatory or voluntary collection targets for specific products and materials, and assigning responsibility to producers or retailers for end-of-life management to achieve these targets. ● Secondly, “economic and market-based instruments” which provide a financial incentive to producers to implement the EPR policy in several forms, including deposit refund systems (DRS) and advance disposal fees (ADF), which are fees levied on individual products at the point of purchase. ● The third instrument is “regulations and performance standards” including technical standards and mandatory recycling rates. 49 ● and last “Information-based instruments” which aim to indirectly support EPR programmes by raising public awareness via reporting requirements, labelling of products and information campaigns for consumers about producer responsibility and waste separation. The choice of EPR as a preferred instrument is evident from the fact that such schemes for waste streams including packaging, waste of electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), batteries and end-of-life vehicles (ELVs) have been systematically implemented in almost all Member States to achieve the required targets. The EU Directive on waste electrical and electronic products outlines the responsibilities of producers and distributors. The EU Waste Framework Directive’s revision in 2018 has included a definition and joint principles for EPR schemes. In its newest revision from 2018, the EU Directive on packaging and packaging waste requires that all EU member states have established EPR schemes for all packaging by December 2024, and countries such as Denmark are currently working on it. General minimum criteria for EPR schemes in EU member states are currently in development.64. Additional waste streams for which EPR schemes have been most commonly identified within the European Union are tyres, graphic paper, oils, and medical waste and agricultural films. In addition to the main EPR schemes, other product streams are covered by a limited number of EPR schemes in some Member States. While the EU EPR guidance is broad and comprehensive it is variably adapted in each of the Member States resulting in the lack of a harmonised definition and scope for EPR. Moreover, many of the EPR schemes are being reviewed to remedy some typical challenges: ● Limited transparency of information especially regarding cost coverage; ● The inadequacy of control/monitoring mechanisms; ● The failure to accurately determine the amount of costs that should be internalised through recycling targets, even though they are regarded as common performance indicators for EPR policies. Thus, separate collection targets should also be considered as EPR schemes covering separate collection and treatment costs, but not a mixed waste collection; ● The lack of compliance and poor enforcement of the stakeholders involved due to multiple Producer Responsibility schemes. To implement an effective and customized EPR framework in Singapore it would be wise to face these challenges by learning from EU best practices. Learning from the EU challenges, failures and successes, could become a significant asset for Singapore and help to significantly reduce its own risks of implementing EPR schemes. This point is also relevant to the overall Circular Economy adoption considering the fact that the EU has been implementing it for a much longer time and thus has more experiences to share. 2.2 THE SINGAPORE CONTEXT Legislative framework: Singapore while recognizing the relevance of EPR systems has only limitedly applied this approach - and it is only recently being contemplated in the context of plastics and packaging. The RSA has mandated EPR requirements for e-waste and mandatory reporting requirements for packaging. A few companies have a voluntary take back program (e.g. Ricoh which collects back its photocopy machine ink cartridges)65 The RSA also contemplates a DRS system but it shall come into effect only in 2022 and the mechanics of such a system are yet unknown. Early-stage piloting of DRS systems have been underway in Singapore by NTUC supermarkets with little success to date which further highlights a current lack or recycling mind-set among Singaporeans66. 64 https://www.eunomia.co.uk/reports-tools/ec-waste-framework-directive-epr-recommendations-for-guidance/ 65 Resource Sustainability Act: https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Acts-Supp/29-2019/Published/20191004?DocDate=20191004 66CNA NTUC Reverse Vending Machines https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/reverse-vending-machine-ntuc-vouchers-tampines-hub-recycling-12262070 50 EPR for E-waste: Singapore's approach to EPR is currently focused on e-waste. Singapore is applying a four step process to EPR implementation which comprises: ● Definition of Regulated Waste: The NEA defines precisely what would fall under the regulation. This comprises categories and subcategories of products to avoid any misunderstanding of what type of products are covered. ● Producer Responsibility Scheme (PRS): The NEA will appoint a PRS operator to develop and implement a system to organise the collection and recycling of regulated consumer products, on behalf of the producers. The PRS Operator will be appointed through an open tender in 2020, and the winning bidder will be required to: develop programmes to encourage the public to recycle e-waste; provide avenues for e-waste recycling (e.g. scheduled collection drives and e-waste bins in public areas); collect and transport the e-waste to NEA-licensed e-waste recyclers; and report the tonnage of e-waste collected to NEA. ● Producer obligations: provides guidelines on precisely what actions the producers need to take. For instance in the case of e-wastes this implies producers to: Register with the NEA; Keep records on regulated products supplied; Submit records on regulated products to NEA; Being a member of the licensed Producer Responsibility Scheme; Ensure collection and disposal of unwanted products; Keep records on regulated non-consumer products collected and how they are managed; and submit records on non-consumer products collected and how they are managed to the NEA. ● Retailers’ obligations: provides guidelines on precisely what actions the retailers need to take. For instance for e-waste this involves: providing 1-for-1 take back of regulated consumer products and in-store collection of e-waste. The case of packaging waste: Packaging waste accounts for about one-third of Singapore’s domestic waste, hence represents a substantial opportunity for reduction through improved design and recycling. In 2021, brands, manufacturers, importers and retailers with a turnover over 10 million Singapore dollars are required to submit their packaging waste report as well as plans to reduce waste. As this is a new approach, it is expected that the deployment of e-waste EPR will be closely monitored by authorities to understand its weaknesses, perception by the stakeholders and areas for improvement before deploying the next category of plastics and packaging. Looking at how other schemes have been deployed in Singapore, it is expected that audits and surveys will be conducted. If successfully implemented in Singapore, EPR has the potential to contribute to solving several waste management challenges including i) Providing incentives to prevent waste at the source ii) Promoting product design for the environment, which was locally initiated by the Singapore BCA (Building and Construction Authority) and SEC (Singapore Environment Council) agencies through their eco-products schemes and by a few private companies such as GreenPack, and iii) Supporting the achievements of public recycling and materials management goals. This will subsequently enable the Deposit-Return-Scheme (DRS) that is aimed to further increase recycling of certain types of packaging. More measures will be rolled out as part of the overall EPR program. 2.3 OPPORTUNITIES FOR EPR WITHIN THE EU-SINGAPORE CONTEXT The table below examines in greater detail the application of EPR in Singapore so as to highlight the opportunities to most effectively use EPR in the context of plastics. 51 Table 3: Exploring Opportunities in the EPR Context. Areas of Opportunity Singapore Context EU Context Reporting Requirements In Singapore, the mandatory packaging reporting requirements under the Resource Sustainability Act will commence from 1 July 2020. Companies that supply regulated goods into the Singapore market, such as manufacturers and importers of packaged products, as well as retailers such as supermarkets will be required to report data annually on the amount of packaging that they put into the market. It is worth mentioning that a significant number of products are not currently covered by the reporting requirements (only for electronics and subsequently packaging items) and that only certain companies reaching a sufficient turnover fall under the scheme. As with Eco-Labels, the very restrictive nature of such schemes may have a negative impact on its efficiency. In the EU, data on packaging waste generation, recovery and incineration at waste incineration plants with energy recovery and recycling have to be provided annually by the Member States. OPPORTUNITY 11: As this EPR process is new to Singapore there will need to be an adaptation phase for accurate data to be generated and reported by the producers. Also, relevant will be learnings from industry experience of reporting data (especially from those that have reporting obligations in other jurisdictions) and the development of advanced, transparent and effective data collection systems DRS Systems The NEA will Implement a Deposit Refund Scheme (DRS) by 2022 as the first phase of the Extended Producer Responsibility framework for Packaging Waste Management. The Deposit Refund Scheme will encourage the take-back and recycling of packaging such as plastic bottles and aluminium cans. In 2019 Singapore launched the “Recycle N Save” programme. As part of this pilot, 50 vending machines were deployed at supermarket outlets throughout Singapore in what the government described as the biggest initiative of its kind to encourage the public to recycle, but initial enthusiasm has now diminished as indicated by lower participation rates. As highlighted by the MSE and other respondents, the deposit recovery system being contemplated in Singapore is partly based on systems that are in use in Germany and Norway. DRS systems have been implemented in several EU countries such as Norway, Sweden and Germany, achieving a high recycling rate of beverage containers of over 80 %. These systems have different governance and administration models. Advanced Disposal Fees (ADF) Singapore has not implemented an ADF system yet. A range of schemes67 have been deployed throughout EU member countries especially with regards to plastic bags and batteries items. It is quite clear that there are a number of innovative approaches being implemented across Europe, but the approach is uneven. All packaging EPR schemes in the EU include some very basic fee modulation since they charge different fees to producers for each packaging material placed on the market. Fees for plastic and for composite packaging materials tend to be 67 EPR and Plastic report https://ieep.eu/uploads/articles/attachments/95369718-a733-473b-aa6b-153c1341f581/EPR%20and%20plastics%20report%20IEEP%209%20Nov%202017%20final.pdf?v=63677462324 52 significantly higher than fees for other packaging materials such as paper, card, glass and metals. Packaging, Waste, and Landfill Taxes Singapore is not looking into a waste tax system at this time however this could be on the agenda in the near future given other recently implemented taxes and especially the carbon tax. It is likely that the carbon tax implementation will be closely monitored by authorities and could serve as a benchmark to implement packaging and waste taxes. Taxes also form part of the picture in the EU. The landfill taxes that are currently in place in 20 EU Member States often help to drive waste away from landfill towards preferable alternatives such as composting, recycling, and reuse. This can be particularly successful when teamed with bans on landfilling specific materials such as biodegradable and recyclable waste. Fifteen EU countries currently have landfill bans on various types of waste Packaging taxes, typically applied to producers based on the amount of material they place on the market, are also in use in several EU countries, including Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Malta, Netherlands, Romania and Slovenia. Some taxes relevant to plastic packaging have direct links to EPR. For instance, the Finnish beverage packaging tax incentivises participation in the DRS by offering a lower tax rate for participants registered in a DRS system. Note: It is important to note that taxes themselves are different from EPR but a useful tool to ensure/ prompt industry to consider EPR. EPR in E-waste E-waste: Singapore generates 60,000 tonnes of electrical and electronic waste each year. The NEA has only recently introduced a regulated e-waste management system that will ensure the proper collection and handling as well as the extraction of valuable resources from e-waste. The five e-products classes regulated under this EPR system are Solar photovoltaic panels, information & communications technology, ICT equipment, large appliances, batteries and lamps. The E-waste collection and responsibility schemes vary within the EU member countries and it would be beneficial to match the most relevant case studies. Other schemes introduced in the EU are for batteries, hazardous waste, and tyres. OPPORTUNITY 12: Given the relatively nascent EPR policy application in other industries within Singapore, it could explore the EPR potential for other materials based on EU experiences. This could also be linked to DRS systems deployments which currently lack a proper framework. The EU has a long experience with DRS systems which could certainly be of use to Singapore’s implementation agenda. 53 Industry Partnerships A research grant call under the “Closing the Waste Loop Initiative” was launched for the sustainable design of plastic materials for Singapore. The goal is to allow for plastics to be more reusable, easier to recycle and to extract value from waste plastics. Together with industry, academia and public stakeholders, the European Commission has launched a Circular Plastics Alliance. It envisages to increase the EU market for recycled plastics to 10 million tonnes by 2025.68 OPPORTUNITY 13: To the extent that there are innovative and industry centric schemes that engage businesses in developing unique and novel approaches to address the issue of packaging design and recycling, Singapore could adapt these EU initiatives to its local context. 2.4 EPR RELATED RECOMMENDATIONS Valuing wastes: One of the main issues going forward would be to find ways to value the waste beyond just energy production. For items besides the construction sector, the concept of circularity is relatively new in Singapore and making the business case for circularity of plastics and packaging will allow for a more robust EPR intervention. Moreover, this could also be an opportunity to advance new businesses and technologies even starting with areas such as e-waste. In 2016, the global e-waste industry was valued at €55 billion and the Singapore market is estimated at $234 million. Developing cutting-edge competence in the field of e-waste processing under environmentally and socially sustainable conditions with help from the EU could allow local businesses to lead the Asian e-waste industry, which accounts for 40 per cent of global e-waste generation. Furthermore, there is a link between plastic and e-waste recycling considering the fact that a significant portion of e-waste (e.g. circuit boards) is made of plastics (various polymers). Challenges that need to be overcome include contamination and separation of the different types of polymers from e-waste for recycling. Recognizing Singapore’s challenges: Any proposed EPR system or industry obligation must account for the limitations posed by the lack of both separate collection and recycling infrastructure in Singapore. As the situation is shifting due to significant developments in waste processing infrastructures, the EPR would need to be progressively deployed in line with available developing capacity, a situation that similar contexts in the EU could serve as case studies. Contrastingly, some relative advantages in Singapore can be capitalised upon such as a strong regulatory framework with effective enforcement and monitoring systems already in place. Behaviour Change: Invoking the “information requirements of EPR” could be an important opportunity in Singapore, harnessing the industry to help direct behaviour change. Singaporeans lack a recycling culture to systematically segregate their waste effectively in view of circularity. As it has been highlighted in previous sections, the central chute system, implemented in the vast majority of households, and the lack of regulations on disposal have created this climax of a throwaway linear mind-set. To adopt similar recycling standards than in EU countries such as France or Germany, large scale educational campaigns would need to be carried out on an ongoing basis and EPR would be a good focus point. An example would be advertisements by manufacturers to incite consumers to return their product recyclable used parts (such as ink cartridges) and the EU could leverage on its experience to assist Singapore with this communication process. Alternative mechanisms: Exploring other mechanisms such waste management fees as well other landfill taxes may also further the potential for engagement with the EU. Singapore’s Carbon tax could be used as a framework to develop an equivalent one for plastics and packaging. 68 https://ec.europa.eu/growth/industry/policy/circular-plastics-alliance_en 54 SECTION 3 GREEN PUBLIC PROCUREMENT 55 GREEN PUBLIC PROCUREMENT (GPP) IN EU AND SINGAPORE 3.1 GPP IN THE EU As defined by the European Commission, GPP (Green Public Procurement) often also referred to as “Green Purchasing” is a process whereby public authorities seek to procure goods, services and works with a reduced environmental impact throughout their life cycle when compared to goods, services and works with the same primary function that would otherwise be procured. GPP aims to leverage the public sector’s significant share of a country’s purchasing power to reduce environmental impacts through the adoption of more responsible purchasing practices but also to influence the market towards the adoption of more sustainable practices. By promoting and using GPP, public authorities can provide the industry with incentives for developing sustainable technologies and products. Additionally, GPP can help stimulate demand for more sustainable goods and services, which would otherwise be difficult to reach the market, and in doing so help create a new market for these. Case study: In 1998, the city of Vienna introduced the EcoBuy program with the aim of introducing ecological criteria in the city’s procurement process. The program has been used by the city and its affiliated enterprises since 2003 and it has saved EUR44.4 million and over 100,000 tonnes of CO2 in the first three years of operations alone; it is a good example of how GPP can also be successful at saving public costs while meeting environmental targets. Graphic 7: CO2-eq. reduction achieved with GPP in Vienna, Austria (2004-2008) Source: Clean Energy Ministerial69 In Europe, at the centre of GPP policies are eco-labelling and similar environmental schemes which have been put in place to guide consumers on the purchase of products and services with lesser environmental and social footprints. Europe has many such labels, some of the most cited include the German Blue Angel or the Nordic Swan. With eco-labels, consumers select products and services according to specific environmental and social criteria. These criteria help guide our purchasing decisions by providing information about reusability, the use of recycled content, 69 GPP in the city of Vienna https://c2e2.unepdtu.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/04/sead-gpp-me-guide-final-colors.pdf 56 reparability, etc.70. For businesses, eco-labels provide a means of measuring performance and also communicating and marketing the environmental credentials of a given product/ packaging. These eco-labels also encourage the behavioural change of producers and consumers towards long-term sustainability. Case Study: Companies apply for an eco-label for many reasons, including to enhance their reputation, gain market advantage, or respond to customers’ demands. Since 2004, the Department of Territory and Sustainability of the Catalan Government has been the responsible body in Catalonia for awarding the European Eco-label. In 2012, in a review of the evolution of companies by ecolabel product categories, a relatively clear relation was identified between the increase in the number of companies certifying professional multipurpose cleaners with the EU ecolabel and significant GPP actions in the Region. After major janitorial contracts for the Barcelona City Council (in 2006 and 2008) and the Catalan Government (in 2006 and 2009) included environmental criteria for cleaning products, the number of companies certifying professional cleaning products increased considerably (see graphic 8). This, together with other evidence (e.g. marketing messages stating that the company’s products comply with GPP criteria) indicate that GPP has stimulated the market of such eco-labelled products in the region. For other product categories, the relationship was not seen, for several reasons such as: reduced number of manufacturers in the region that requested certification by the Catalan body (figures were only available for companies certified in Catalonia, and not Europe-wide) and lack of other product categories oriented mainly for professional use and not the general public. What this case study shows is that GPP has the potential to significantly influence the market towards more sustainable practices. Graphic 8: Evolution of Companies Ecolab ling Cleaners in Relation to Major GPP Actions in Catalonia Source: Sans, M. (September, 2012) Green Public Procurement policies drive green market in Catalonia, 8th EcoProcura Conference, Malmö, Sweden. 70 Further analysis of these voluntary labels with regards to aspects related to circular economy (reusability, reparability, use of recycled materials and recyclability, etc.) would be helpful. 57 3.2 GPP IN SINGAPORE In Singapore, current GPP directions are strongly in favour of its schemes comprising the Singapore Green Label, Energy label, Water Efficiency Label and the BCA Green Mark Scheme for buildings and construction products. However, a notable difference is that the EU has many policies and frameworks already in place on top of the Eco Labels criteria whereas Singapore still relies on its Eco Labels as main guiding principles for its GPP i.e. the current policy measures are primarily limited to public authorities purchasing items that have acquired an EcoLabel. Another important element to highlight is that green purchasing can be broad and may not necessarily relate to the Circular Economy, for instance, the purchase of energy-efficient appliances (e.g. L.E.D lights) is often considered a type of green procurement. Thus, if GPP intends to benefit the Circular Economy it is important for governments to define what is meant by green procurement. The implementation of GPP in Singapore is likely to drive similar patterns by pushing for more products gaining endorsement under the Singapore Green Labelling Schemes. In doing so, companies will have to adapt their products and manufacturing process to more stringent ecological requirements imposed by the schemes. Learning from Europe’s journey, typically the adoption of a GPP framework would require going through a series of steps including: ● The analysis and fitting of the GPP within local legal and policy frameworks: Often agencies already have a set of procurement guidelines to follow legal requirements on aspects such as safety (e.g. office furniture to meet fire safety standards), ethics or competitive market rules. While implementing a GPP framework, categories of more sustainable products alternatives need to be individually assessed to ensure that such legal requirements are met, a process which can be tedious and lengthy. ● Understanding the market capacity and assessing costs and benefits: Currently, sustainable products endorsed by eco-labels only cover a small portion of consumer items, thus gaining an understanding of the state of the green market is important before instructing agencies to purchase green products. The costs aspects are also of importance because usually public agencies operate on limited allocated budgets and often sustainable alternatives are still more expensive than normal options. As the cost variation depends on the type of products or services, researching the market is important to create feasible purchasing guidelines. ● Introducing new environmental standards in procurement: The key to GPP requires customization to the geography where it is implemented. For instance, the types of products and services purchased in Europe and Asia can differ substantially as well as the environmental impacts involved. A good example would be the palm oil or fisheries practices in Asia which would need to be reflected strongly in Green Procurement practices. ● Raising awareness and monitoring: To date, GPP has been a voluntary instrument, which means that public authorities can determine the extent to which they implement it. To convince the parties involved to adhere to GPP it is primordial to raise awareness on the need to shift to more responsible procurement and the mechanisms available to do so. While GPP is widespread and has been happening in Europe for over a decade, the concept is very new to Singapore and is still in the process of being fully implemented. Given the state of advancement of GPP in the EU over Singapore, it is clear that on this aspect there is a lot of know-how to be transferred and to learn from challenges faced. For instance, the fact that GPP is not uniformly implemented throughout the EU member states reflects that implementation challenges differ greatly between countries and that customization of a framework would be required for Singapore. 58 Graphic 9: Green Contracts in European Countries The proportion of green contract value, as well as the green contract quantity, out of all contracts in each country for 2012 (a more recent assessment is not readily available). If looking at all countries, the value of green contracts takes 21.81% of the total procurement value; and the green contract quantity accounts for 9.49% of all contracts. Switzerland, Denmark, Belgium, France, Ireland, Norway are countries with the highest uptake of GPP. (Source: Centre for European Policy Studies and College of Europe). This GPP implementation disparity is also observed within ASEAN. While Singapore currently lacks focus on its GPP strategy, other Asian countries are at a more advanced stage of deployment. For instance, Thailand’s GPP program started in 2005 and has targeted policies on biodegradable plastics. While biodegradable plastics strategies would not apply to Singapore considering that there are no common landfill (all waste goes to incineration before reaching the landfill), Singapore would require a more customized and targeted approach to GPP. 3.3 OPPORTUNITIES FOR GPP WITHIN THE EU-SINGAPORE CONTEXT In order to better understand the context between Singapore and the EU, the below table provides a comparative analysis and resulting opportunities. Table 4: Exploring Opportunities for GPP Areas of Opportunity Singapore Context EU Context Public Purchasing power Government spending in Singapore is around 17% of GDP (2012). However, Singapore has a unique structure very different from the situation in Europe whereby the Government runs two investment companies, GIC Private Limited and Temasek Holdings, which manage Singapore's reserves. Both operate as commercial investment holding companies independently of the Singapore Government despite strong links to it, If those investment companies are counted as public purchasing, the public share of GDP would be EU Public authorities are typically large administrations and also major consumers spending approximately 1.8 trillion euro annually which represents around 16 % of the EU’s gross domestic product!71 Furthermore, in some EU sectors, public purchasers comprise a significant share of the market including public transport and construction, health services and education. Thus by using their purchasing power to choose goods and services with lower impacts on the environment (i.e. GPP), they can make an important contribution to sustainable consumption and production at the European and member countries level. 71 https://ec.europa.eu/environment/gpp/what_en.htm 59 significantly higher and as a result GPP in Singapore could have a very significant impact depending on how public purchasing is defined. OPPORTUNITY 12: Singapore’s public purchasing power is very powerful yet currently unexploited with regards to GPP. Considering its extensive experience, the EU could contribute to policy formulations and customizing sector specific purchasing solutions. Purchasing Guidelines In its published “Public Sector Sustainability Plan,” Singapore has provided a clear roadmap for government agencies' strategy to lead in sustainability practices for the period 2017-2020. To date, GPP initiatives remain limited in Singapore and can be summarized in four directives: First, the government has requested that all public agencies only purchase paper products certified under the Singapore Green Label (SGLS) administered by the Singapore Environment Council. Secondly, all electrical appliances purchased by public agencies should now be certified with high energy efficiency including refrigerators, televisions, air conditioners and lamps. Noteworthy is that many of these appliances are certified under Singapore’s own Energy Efficiency label which is used as the guiding purchasing criteria. Thirdly, where possible, the government has aggregated demand across agencies to achieve economies of scale and Green Sourcing requirement has been included in the government procurement contracts. Again purchasing criteria are focused on the SGLS. And lastly, government agencies are required to organize events and functions in Singapore Green Mark (US LEED equivalent) certified venues. For leasing agencies, the minimum standard has been set at Green Mark Gold. Over the years the EU has produced a range of documents including “The Buying Green Handbook on Environmental Public Procurement” advising purchasers on legal and practical aspects of GPP as well as a range of other written and online materials that could be valuable case studies for Singapore’s own GPP agenda. Furthermore, since 2008 the EU Commission has developed more than 20 common GPP criteria covering various product and service groups. The priority sectors for implementing GPP were selected through a multi-criteria analysis including scope for environmental improvement; public expenditure; potential impact on suppliers; potential for setting an example to private or corporate consumers; political sensitivity; the existence of relevant and easy-to-use criteria; market availability and economic efficiency. OPPORTUNITY 13: Singapore’s GPP directions are predominantly targeting the country’s own labelling schemes. While it is a good effort to promote local initiatives this also restricts the choice of green products and services. Exploring bilateral partnerships between Singapore Environmental labelling schemes and the EU Eco labels could be an avenue for GPP collaboration. Deployments GPP is very new in Singapore. Main events can be linked to the Singapore GPP movement: First, the Singapore Green Labelling Scheme has been for many years the only source of guidance on green purchasing. The scheme has broadened its products significantly in recent years. Secondly, the haze event that Singapore has endured in 2012 has pushed the government to act and require all public agencies to purchase paper from sustainable sources. This was a direct response to some paper products sold in Singapore originating from companies linked to the haze. As opposed to Singapore, GPP is already widespread in Europe and has been adopted by almost all European countries. The European GPP agenda has reached such a level of maturity that initiatives have started to spread beyond its borders. For instance the 10YFP/One Planet Network Programme on Sustainable Public Procurement was developed as a global multi stakeholder platform supporting the implementation of SPP around the world. Examples of their activities include the Asia Pacific Green Public Procurement and Eco Labelling of ASEAN countries. Another international initiative supported by the EU is the Sustainable Public Product and Ecolabelling (SPPEL) project, implemented by UN Environment. The project combines the two elements of ecolabelling and sustainable public procurement to stimulate the demand and supply of sustainable products in countries across the world. 60 And thirdly, the setup of the Green Mark Scheme in Singapore has started a movement surrounding the construction industry focused on energy efficiency but also increasingly on buildings retrofit products. OPPORTUNITY 14: The EU already has an international GPP deployment programme while Singapore has some elements of this programme already in action. Seeking stronger partnerships between Singapore and the SPPEL could be a good avenue for collaboration. 3.4 GPP RECOMMENDATIONS Broadening the GPP purchasing scope: Currently, Singapore is relying on its Green Labelling Scheme as guidance for the GPP, however, there is an opportunity to significantly broaden the choice of green products and services by collaborating with EU Ecolabels and other EU green services providers. Noteworthy, is that based on criteria description comparison the Singapore Green Label is less stringent (e.g. toxicity benchmarks, certificates) than some other European labels such as the German Blue Angels or the Nordic Swan which are known in the industry as having some of the highest standards in the world. Thus extending the list of purchasable items to EU eco-labels would not result in any quality drop. Stronger partnership with EU Eco Labels is an avenue for collaborations and this could be done through the Sustainable Public Product and Ecolabelling (SPPEL) framework already put in place by the EU. Moving from a voluntary GPP basis to regulatory: while GPP has been a voluntary instrument, perhaps the next step would be to make it mandatory for all public agencies and also to extend it to the private sector. Considering its stronger experience in GPP, Europe could assist Singapore with this transition and policy formulation. SG/EU Government Partnerships: As Singapore and the EU are aligned on their objectives to implement a GPP framework; this could be an opportunity to strengthen direct collaborations between Singapore and European Public Agencies. A good start would be a collaboration between the Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the European Commission as well as involvement with Singapore Enterprise. The latest is active with organising trade business missions overseas with close collaboration with the Singapore Business Federation. Trade missions could be an excellent avenue to exchange the respective Eco Labels criteria and products. Also strengthening partnerships on GPP and the broader Circular Economy between MSE/ NEA and the European Environment Agency could be explored. Last but not least, the ASEAN perspective should not be taken out of the picture while looking into EPR and GPP frameworks. While to date actions have taken place at the country's level (e.g. Thailand's bioplastics policies) there is a great potential for uniformization of such policies at the ASEAN level in a similar way then what has been done by the European Commission in Europe. Considering the similar context there is an opportunity for Europe to contribute its experience on the implementation of EPR and GPP on a regional level. 61 SECTION 4 THE WAY FORWARD 62 4.1 ALIGNMENT WITH THE SINGAPORE CONTEXT Even as each opportunity whether pertaining to Circular Economy or either of EPR and GPP is considered, some important steps must be taken into account. First alignment with the Singapore context is important. This includes: 1. Alignment on Shared Principles: This study explores the underlying principles and policy, however a deeper dive into the policy preferences especially with regard to the waste hierarchy is important. Reviewing Singapore’s targets aimed landfill reduction and recycling to assess their impact on plastics and/or packaging. Finally, the case for a plastics focussed approach may be emphasized given the evolution of Circular Economy in the EU. 2. Making the Business Case/ Economic Argument: The EU may emphasize the financial benefits and therefore reinforce the economic case for a Circular Economy using examples from the Member States while also making the case for resource efficiency. Given Singapore’s focus on economic independence, maintaining its status as an attractive business location and high priority on resource efficiency, this approach should be well aligned with existing goals. 3. Aligning with the Innovation/ Pioneering Model: Creating opportunities for innovation and allowing Singapore to leapfrog some of the stages of a Circular Economy evolution through learnings from the EU will resonate with Singapore’s research and innovation centric approach. 4. Establishing industry and community engagement: Given the need for Singapore to ensure alignment with industry and community players, and the emphasis on a multistakeholder approach within the EU context, it makes sense to lead the dialogue with industry partnerships as well as effective behaviour change activities and community engagements. The main opportunities for Europe are on several fronts and have been highlighted in the report. Synthesising the findings, the five most significant opportunities to seize are: 1) Strong Plastics Focused Strategies 2) Comprehensive Policy Integration 3) Separate Waste Collection Strategies 4) EPR/DRS Systems 5) Adoption of a waste hierarchy Among all policy frameworks, EPR and GPP are the most promising considering their success stories in Europe. Particular efforts should be put in strengthening collaborations on the two policy aspects. While opportunities are available and that the timing is right, the EU will inevitably face challenges partnering with Singapore on its circularity agenda. Some of these key challenges will include European technologies not always being suitable for the Singapore context, or that Singapore may favour collaborations within ASEAN over Europe. Last but not least the current geopolitical and economic situation is rapidly shifting (e.g. COVID 19) which could make partnerships more difficult and delay the Circular Economy adoption plans. The EU has therefore integrated circular economy and the European Green Deal into its efforts for “green recovery” from the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, Singapore and the EU are well aligned on their objectives of developing a stronger Circular Economy presence which gives an excellent basis for collaboration. This unique opportunity should not be delayed and this report has highlighted several areas for ongoing partnerships, some which could be implemented rapidly while others 63 would require a longer approach. Both geographies offer strength but also face challenges and risks which could greatly be reduced through bilateral partnerships on the Circular Economy. 4.2 PRIORITIZING ACTION While all opportunities presented are important, in order to maximize the chances of partnerships it is important to prioritize actions and to plan a collaborative strategy accordingly. Such prioritization can also help determine the amount of efforts and resources that would need to be allocated for each opportunity. The proposed below assessment relies on a two way matrix that measures potential impact against the ease of adoption with a rating ranging from low to high: QUICK WINS Given the ease of adoption these strategies will build the trust and create a conducive environment for longer term engagement. Examples include: ● Adoption of the Waste Hierarchy. Singapore currently has no waste hierarchy in place as the vast majority of the waste still goes to incineration. On the other hand the EU has a developed waste hierarchy which has been in place for many years. Therefore there is a clear opportunity for experience transfer from the EU to Singapore on this aspect. As EU policies are already established this can be done quickly. ● Alignment on Landfill Management Principles. In Singapore landfill solutions have become an urgent matter as its only offshore landfill is reaching saturation. ● Innovation and Research. Singapore is pushing for active research on circularity and welcomes foreign expertise. There is also significant funding available for research in Singapore. Research partnerships between universities and research institutes in the EU and Singapore through student exchange etc. could be explored. ● Adoption of GPP and strengthening of Eco Labels. GPP is only at its early stages in Singapore but has been in place for decades in the EU. Furthermore Singapore’s approach to GPP is focused on its own localized eco-labelling schemes. Exploring a more globalized approach aligned with the developed eco labels in Europe could provide a quick boost to Singapore GPP with stronger regional potential as well. 64 LONG TERM ENGAGEMENTS These strategies will lead to high levels of circularity and already have the required framework to adapt to the Singapore context. ● Segregated Waste Disposal and Collection (Singapore requires a significant mind-set change towards recycling which will take a long time. Furthermore changing the collection mechanisms will also require a change in the processing facilities and overall waste management infrastructure which will take many years) ● Adoption of EPR and DRS System (such approaches are linked to the mind-set change required and will take many years to materialize) LOW PRIORITY These strategies are neither easy to adopt nor likely to have great impact in terms of circularity for Singapore, given disparities when compared with the EU. Examples are: ● Alignment on production and source reduction standards. This would be very complex to implement in Singapore - the charges on plastics bags have faced heavy criticism and bans on plastics may be equally resisted. The source reduction strategies may need to be prefaced by some attempts to ensure community alignment. ● Developing Secondary Market strategies. While much needed, it would be best to strengthen existing frameworks before exploring secondary markets; also gaining access to the EU secondary market would require high level trade negotiations and thirdly the secondary market is not mature yet and still in the process of being developed in the EU. ● Waste to Energy. This aspect is already well taken care of in Singapore and would be the least preferred option in terms of developing the Circular Economy. EXPLORATION These strategies may be harder to adopt/ implement but likely to have great impact on circularity. They merit careful consideration. Developing longer term engagement with the EU will allow for continuous guidance and knowledge sharing. Examples include: ● Alignment on a comprehensive circular economy policy with deep focus on plastics (first a proper mechanism and infrastructures would need to be in place which will take many years) ● Local and Regional Recycling Opportunities (while important and part of the solution, before embarking on regional opportunities Singapore should focus on improving its own waste management landscape). CONCLUSION This report has provided a detailed comparative analysis of the state of the Circular Economy in Europe and Singapore to advise the EU on where the opportunities stand in Singapore and to some extent the broader Asian region which cannot be omitted from the Circular Economy strategy given the regional nature of the waste framework. Looking beyond Singapore, the context in Europe and ASEAN are similar considering the great disparity between individual member countries on the adoption of Circular Economy principles. Singapore has a robust legal framework and is leading the way on certain circularity aspects such as research and construction waste recycling. However, other aspects and in particular plastic recycling are better reflected in other ASEAN countries like Thailand. As in Europe there are a lot of opportunities to learn from best practices at the regional and global level. The Circular Economy journey has only just started in Asia and much still needs to be done to truly adhere to such a business model. 65 The timing for collaboration between the EU and Singapore could not be better as both geographies are in the process of increasing their efforts in waste management and aiming for stronger circularity within their frameworks. This is well expressed in recent published reports in both geographies released at about the same time. There are clear synergies of objectives to achieve and many of the specific targets set out in these reports are well aligned; a promising sign that mutual collaborations could strengthen their individual programs. It is clear from this analysis that Europe is overall more advanced in terms of recycling policies, technology and deployment than Singapore’s Circular Economy journey to date which is still in early stages. However, Singapore is in the process of significantly stepping-up actions as highlighted in its recent Zero Waste Management Master Plan providing a clear road map going ahead and has a proven track record with respect to its policy forward approach. 66 APPENDIX WASTE POLICIES IN THE EU Table 5: An overview of Waste Policies in the EU EU Directive Specific EU WASTE FRAMEWORK DIRECTIVE The EU Waste Framework Directive 2008 provides the concepts and definitions related to waste management, waste, recycling, and recovery. Waste legislation policy is imposed as a priority in accordance with a five-tiered hierarchy of (i) waste prevention, (ii) preparing for reuse, (iii) recycling, (iv) recovery, and (v) disposal (landfill / incineration without energy recovery). The waste management hierarchy is essentially an extension of the precautionary and prevention principles, establishing a priority order for waste treatment options in terms of the lowest possible environmental impact and minimization of final waste. This is done in order to provide a framework to support decision making for waste management systems at the local and/or national levels. EU LANDFILL DIRECTIVE The EU Landfill Directive 1999 identifies landfilling as the least preferable option for waste disposal and requires that it should be limited to the necessary minimum. Where waste needs to be landfilled, it must be sent to landfills which comply with the requirements of the Landfill Directive. The objective of the Directive is to prevent or reduce as far as possible negative effects on the environment, in particular on surface water, groundwater, soil, air, and on human health from the landfilling of waste by introducing stringent technical requirements for waste and landfills. The Landfill Directive defines the different categories of waste (municipal waste, hazardous waste, non-hazardous waste and inert waste) and applies to all landfills, defined as waste disposal sites for the deposit of waste onto or into landfill. In 2014, the European Commission adopted a legislative proposal to review waste- related targets in the Landfill Directive which aims at phasing out landfilling by 2025 for recyclable waste (including plastics, paper, metals, glass and bio-waste) in non-hazardous waste landfills, corresponding to a maximum landfilling rate of 25%. Also, this focus on packaging waste is reinforced by the more general target which requires that the amount of municipal waste landfilled must be reduced to 10% or less of the total amount of municipal waste generated by 2035. PACKAGING AND PACKAGING WASTE DIRECTIVE The Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive 1994 specifically addresses the aspects of packaging waste, and the balancing of the sometimes conflicting policies of environmental protection and the smooth functioning of the packaged goods market. In 2004, the Directive was amended to provide criteria clarifying the definition of the term ‘packaging’ and increase the targets for recovery and recycling of packaging waste. In 2005, the Directive was revised again to grant new EU member states transitional periods for attaining the recovery and recycling targets. The latest revision of the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive occurred on 29 April 2015 with the adoption of Directive (EU) 2015/720 of the European Parliament and the Council Amending Directive 94/62/EC as regards the consumption of lightweight plastic carrier bags. This directive requires that the EU countries must take measures to reduce the consumption of plastic carrier bags with wall thickness between 15-50 microns. Consumption must be limited to a maximum annual 90 bags per person by 2019 and 40 bags per person by 2025. Furthermore, these plastic carrier bags are not to be provided free of charge at points of sale of goods so as to discourage consumption. The European Packaging Directive is considered to be a world-leading benchmark for packaging sustainability. This Directive covers all packaging placed on the European Parliament and the Council market and all packaging waste, whether it is used or released at 67 the industrial, commercial, office, shop, service, household or any other level, regardless of the material used. The European Packaging Directive establishes ‘essential requirements’ for different aspects of packaging such as manufacturing, and composition of packaging as well as disposal and end of life treatment. The overarching packaging standard requires that:  Packaging weight and volume be kept to the minimum amount needed for safety, hygiene and consumer acceptance of the packed product; ● Noxious or hazardous constituents be kept to a minimum; and, ● Packaging can be reused or recovered once it has been used. ● Packaging must be designed, produced and commercialised in such a way as to permit its reuse or recovery, including recycling, and to minimise its impact on the environment when packaging waste or residues from packaging waste management operations are disposed of. Packaging must be so manufactured that the presence of noxious and other hazardous substances and materials as constituents of the packaging material or of any of the packaging components is minimised with regard to their presence in emissions, ash or leachate when packaging or residues from management operations or packaging waste are incinerated or landfilled. The standards specified include:  Source reduction (CEN EN 13428). This standard requires that packaging weight and volume be kept to the minimum amount needed for safety, hygiene and consumer acceptance of the packed product;  Reuse (CEN EN 13429). The standards covering reuse require that the packaging must enable a number of trips under “predictable” conditions of use. These standards also require that the recovery standards (below) apply to such packaging when reuse is no longer possible.  Recovery (CEN EN 13430). These standards cover the minimum requirements for packaging recycling and recovery, specifically in the context of:  Material Recycling (CEN EN 13431). Establishment of a weight-based percentage of packaging material (depending on material type) that must be included in the packaging.  Energy Recovery (CEN EN 13432). Establishment of a minimum calorific value to allow for the optimisation of energy recovery.  Organic Recovery (CEN EN 13433): Establishment of requirement with respect to compostable packaging, such that it doesn’t challenge existing composting processes or applications. With respect to biodegradable packaging, the resulting compost must breakdown into the components of carbon dioxide, biomass and water. WEEE DIRECTIVES Two directives aimed at improving the environmental management and resource efficiency of WEEE are:  The WEEE Directive 2002 72 which addresses: o Preventing the creation of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE)*; o Promoting reuse, recycling and other ways of recovering waste from the electrical and electronic equipment. o Supporting the efficient use of resources and recovery of valuable secondary raw materials.  The RoHS Directive 2011, which restricts the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment.73 72 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/LSU/?uri=CELEX:32012L0019 73 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32011L0065 68 CIRCULAR ECONOMY PACKAGE 2015 The Circular Economy Package released in 2015 presented an action plan for the circular economy and four legislative proposals amending directives on waste including three relevant to packaging waste: Waste Framework Directive, Landfilling Directive and Packaging Waste Directive. [1]The new recycling and landfilling targets are expected to boost the re-use of valuable material in waste and improve the way municipal and packaging waste is managed, thus making the circular economy a reality. These include :  Recycling targets for municipal waste are set at 55% by 2025 and 65% by 2035 (previously 50% by 2020) with differentiated targets for each of the different waste streams.  Packaging waste has higher target rates with 65% to be recycled by 2025 and as much as 70% by 2030.  In addition to the separate collection, which already exists for paper and cardboard, glass, metals and plastic, new provisions for separate collection, the inclusion of bio-waste is expected to boost the quality of secondary raw materials and their uptake. The Circular Economy Package anticipates the use of effective economic instruments and other measures in support of the waste hierarchy. Producers are given an important role in this transition through EPR schemes – meaning a producer’s responsibility for a product is extended to the post-consumer stage of a product’s life cycle. PLASTICS STRATEGY Under the Plastics Strategy 2018, the European Union decided to announce a series of actions to spearhead a global movement towards Circular Economy. The highlights of the Plastics Strategy are to: • Make recycling profitable for businesses, • Curb plastic waste, • Stop littering at sea, • Drive investment and innovation, and • Spur change across the world. SINGLE USE PLASTICS DIRECTIVE The Single Use Plastics Directive 2019, is a recent initiative being considered by the EU which goes one step further in addressing plastics products and plastic packaging that are typically intended to be used just once or for a short period of time before they are thrown away. One of the main purposes of this proposed directive is to reduce the amount of plastic waste created. The language of this proposed directive requires that the design of plastic products should always take into account the reusability and recyclability of the product. Where possible, the measures laid down in this proposed directive and their implementation should give priority to waste prevention or to the transition to reusable products rather than to other single-use alternatives. The products banned include: • Plastic cutlery (forks, knives, spoons and chopsticks), plates and plastic straws; • Food containers made of expanded polystyrene, such as fast food boxes, with or without a cover, used to contain food that is intended for immediate consumption either on-the-spot or take-away, and that is ready to be consumed without any further preparation, like cooking, boiling or heating; • Beverage containers made of expanded polystyrene; • Cups for beverages made of expanded polystyrene; and, Products made from oxo-degradable plastic (this term refers to plastic materials which contain additives that promote oxidation of that plastic into micro fragments under aerobic conditions). These oxo-degradable additives can include organic and inorganic additives such 69 as plant starch material, and metal ions such as iron, cobalt, nickel and other stearates. In addition, the member states will be required to take the necessary measures to achieve a measurable quantitative reduction in the consumption of the following products: • Food containers made of plastic, such as fast food boxes, with or without a cover, used to contain food that is intended for immediate consumption either on-the-spot or take-away, and that is ready to be consumed without any further preparation, like cooking, boiling or heating; • Plastic cups for beverages, including their covers and lids; and • There will be a binding target of at least 25% of recycled plastic for Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) beverage bottles from 2025 onwards, and by 2030 all plastic bottles will be required to comprise at least 30% of recycled content. CIRCULAR ECONOMY ACTION PLAN 2020 The Circular Economy Action Plan (March 2020) aims to make the EU economy fit for a green future, strengthen competitiveness while protecting the environment and give new rights to consumers. Make sustainable products the norm in the EU. The Action Plan includes focus on a Sustainable Product Policy, to ensure that products placed on the EU market are designed to last longer, are easier to reuse, repair and recycle, and incorporate as much as possible recycled material instead of primary raw material. Single-use will be restricted, premature obsolescence tackled and the destruction of unsold durable goods banned. The Action Plan also brings focus on the sectors resource-intensive and where the potential for circularity is high. This includes: • Electronics and ICT – a ‘Circular Electronics Initiative' to have longer product lifetimes, and improve the collection and treatment of waste • Batteries and vehicles – new regulatory framework for batteries for enhancing the sustainability and boosting the circular potential of batteries • Packaging – new mandatory requirements on what is allowed on the EU market, including the reduction of (over)packaging • plastics – new mandatory requirements for recycled content and special attention on microplastics as well as biobased and biodegradable plastics • Food – new legislative initiative on reuse to substitute single-use packaging, tableware and cutlery by reusable products in food services. The Action Plan also proposes the transformation of waste into high-quality secondary resources that benefit from a well-functioning market for secondary raw materials. An EU-wide, harmonised model for the separate collection of waste and labelling has been proposed under the Action Plan. The Action Plan also puts forward a series of actions to cut down EU exports of waste and tackle illegal shipments. 70 Table 6: Current Plastics policies and strategies of ASEAN Member States (Source: Enhanced Regional EU-ASEAN Dialogue Instrument Report74) Country Plastic specific strategy Ban of Single use plastics Levy/charge on single-use plastics Deposit Refund scheme EPR-based recycling policies Sorted collection Voluntary scheme/ pilot projects Import regulation Brunei No Plastic Bag Everyday Initiative 3 percent excise duty imposed on plastic imports Cambodia Sub-Decree on Management of Plastic Bags (2017) Sub-decree on plastic waste management Indonesia National policy and strategy on solid waste management (including plastic waste) regulated by Presidential Regulation No. 97/2017.

In its Zero Waste Master Plan, Singapore is aiming to reduce the amount of waste (per capita) to be sent to landfill by 30%. What do you think are key changes Singapore would need to make to achieve this target? Q2. What is your opinion of the efforts Singapore has made to transition to a Circular Economy, specifically, the soon to be launched Integrated Waste Management Facility, the Mandatory Reporting Requirements, and the Deposit Recovery System? Q3. In your opinion how does Singapore benchmark at present against other countries in terms of its Circular Economy strategy and related achievements? Within ASEAN and/on a global level? What could Singapore teach, or learn, from other countries? Q4. In what way are the Circular Economy frameworks adopted in other countries, particularly the EU, relevant or irrelevant to the Singapore context? Q5. What do you see as the main challenges to implement a widespread Circular Economy framework in Singapore (e.g. behavioural change, technological changes, policy changes…)? Please elaborate on why you think they are major challenges given the Singapore context. Q6. In your opinion what would be the most appropriate infrastructure and/ or technology investments to make the Circular Economy a reality in Singapore? Q7. What limitations, if any, are posed by current practices and behaviours such as chute disposal, reliance on food courts and hawker centres in transitioning to a more circular economy with respect to plastics and packaging? Q8. How might the current processes, such as investments in incineration plants and the absence of recycling infrastructure limit the transition to a Circular Economy? What do you think of the financial viability of Circular Economy within a reasonable timeframe here in Singapore? Q9. It is clear that the adoption of a Circular Economy will require involvement from public, private and civil society. What contribution do you anticipate from each of these three sectors? Open question: Do you have any thoughts or insights in the transition to a Circular Economy or its more popular instruments such as EPR, Green Procurement Policies etc.? 73 SUMMARY OF RESPONSES TO QUESTIONNAIRE In order to capture specific insights from a range of stakeholders, we have submitted the above questionnaire to the following agencies: BASF, EDB, JTC, Norwegian MFA, ZeroWaste SG, NEA, and MSE. The general feeling that the answers convey is positive regarding the fact that Singapore is stepping up its efforts on the Circular Economy. All respondents felt that not enough has been done to date in Singapore and that it is critical that solutions to the waste crisis be found within the decade. All respondents felt that Singapore will not be able to solve its waste problem on its own and that collaboration is key. They also acknowledge the fact that the EU has more experience on the matter and will be able to bring in valuable knowledge and experience to boost Singapore Circular Economy strategy. Respondents felt that Singapore’s response may be too focused on technology and that diversified actions are urgently required. While most supported the technology investments. Some even felt that technology alone may worsen the problem further. All agreed that mind-set change is one of the key challenges that Singapore will face in adopting the circular Economy and that it will take time to change poor recycling habits. Some respondents highlighted the fact that Singapore has made it “too easy” for people to dispose of waste without segregation and that this waste culture has been anchored in people's mind-set and habits. As one of the respondents puts it clearly, changing mind-set will require much effort on the magnitude of the Dengue prevention campaigns. Some respondents highlighted the fact that providing stronger incentives is required to change mind-set and initiate recycling habits and that finding the right incentives to convince specific groups will be key to success. While some felt the Government should take the lead on the Circular Economy others argued that the private sector has an equally important role to play and could drive faster change. Overall, respondents felt positively about the strengthening of the Circular Economy Agenda in Singapore and that the EU could significantly improve the situation in Singapore but not without challenges; in the end, it is up to Singapore to make the change. 74 IMPRINT This Comparative Policy Study was commissioned by Expertise France in connection with the project “Rethinking Plastics – Circular Economy Solutions to Marine Litter.” The “Rethinking Plastics” project is funded by the European Union and the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and is implemented by Expertise France and Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH.

This goal will be frontloaded to achieve a 20 per cent reduction in waste-to-landfill per capita per day by 2026 under the Singapore Green Plan 2030. Targets are set with plans of extending the lifespan of Singapore’s only landfill beyond 2035.  \nWe also have 2030 targets to increase non-domestic recycling rate to 80 per cent and domestic recycling rate to 30 per cent.\nWaste and Recycling Targets\nKey Performance Indicators2019 Results2020 Results12021 Results2 TargetsOverall recycling rate60%52% 55%70% by 2030Domestic recycling rate20%13%13%30% by 2030Non-domestic recycling rate70%68% 70%80% by 2030Domestic sector – waste disposed of per capita0.8 kg a day/person0.8 kg a day/person0.8 kg a day/person 20% by 2026Non-domestic sector – waste disposed of per $bn GDP8.9 tonnes a day/GDP ($bn)8.2 tonnes a day/GDP ($bn) 8.7 tonnes a day/GDP ($bn)\nHarnessing Waste Process Synergies\nAs part of NEA’s long-term plan to meet Singapore’s solid waste management needs, we collaborated with PUB in 2013 for the planning and development of the Integrated Waste Management Facility (IWMF). We embarked on a joint preliminary engineering design study to assess the potential of harnessing process synergies by co-locating a solid waste treatment facility with a used water reclamation facility. This led to the co-location of two mega facilities – the IWMF and Tuas Water Reclamation Plant, now collectively known as Tuas Nexus – which will be able to reap co-location synergies across the water-energy-waste nexus to optimise energy and resource recovery, and land use.  \nDeveloped in phases, we have since made several important strides in this greenfield project. Under the first phase, NEA commenced the construction of the Waste-to-Energy Facility (2,900 tonnes/day) and Materials Recovery Facility (250 tonnes/day) in May 2020, and the Sludge Incineration Facility (800 tonnes/day) and Food Waste Treatment Facility (400 tonnes/day) in August 2021. Phase 1 is expected to be completed in 2025 to 2026, with the development of Phase 2, which comprises another waste-to-energy Facility (2,900 tonnes/day), to follow thereafter.  \nIn August 2021, NEA also announced the establishment of our $3 billion Multicurrency Medium Term Note (MTN) Programme and Green Bond Framework. Proceeds from the issuance of Notes under the MTN Programme will be used to finance sustainable infrastructure development projects including the IWMF.\nClosing the Waste and Resource Loops\nThe Closing the Waste Loop (CTWL) Funding Initiative (FI) is a research and development (R&D) programme announced in December 2017, along with the Environmental Services Industry Transformation Map. NEA has been administering the $45 million CTWL FI to develop innovative solutions in resource recovery, conservation of landfill space, and sustainability of our waste management system. As of 31 March 2022, we have committed $37 million to fund 15 R&D projects on the treatment of and resource recovery from priority waste streams – electrical and electronic waste (e-waste), food waste and plastic waste, and diversion of residues such as incineration bottom ash and non-incinerable waste from Semakau Landfill. Several projects have attracted industry interest, leading to 10 industry project collaborations and $2.1 million industry spending pledged to date.  \nOne of these innovative solutions was developed by the Nanyang Technological University, Singapore-CEA Alliance for Research in Circular Economy (SCARCE), which employs green chemical processes that avoided the use of hazardous substances to recover precious metals from e-waste. Using fruit peel, SCARCE has successfully recovered 90 per cent weight of metals, such as nickel, manganese, cobalt and lithium, from spent lithium-ion batteries.  \nIn February 2022, NEA secured $80 million for the Closing the Resource Loop FI, which will build upon the R&D efforts under the earlier Waste-to-Energy FIs and the CTWL FI. This will support waste-related initiatives under the Singapore Green Plan 2030, through research and innovations.\nTaking E-waste Recycling to the Next Level\nOn 1 July 2021, NEA implemented the Extended Producer Responsibility scheme for e-waste management with multiple collection avenues islandwide. The move encourages the public to recycle their e-waste, such as IT equipment, large appliances, light bulbs and tubes, and batteries. The five-year e-waste collection contract was awarded to ALBA E-Waste Smart Recycling Pte Ltd. As the appointed operator of the Producer Responsibility Scheme, ALBA will send all e-waste collected to licensed e-waste recyclers.\nExploring Chemical Recycling Solutions\nNEA is exploring chemical recycling solutions to close the plastic waste loop in Singapore. Chemical recycling is able to process plastics that cannot be mechanically recycled, such as contaminated single-use plastics, and convert these into higher-value products such as pyrolysis oil, that can be used as feedstock to manufacture new plastics and chemicals.  \nTo gain a better understanding of the technical and commercial aspects of a chemical recycling value chain in Singapore, a joint NEA-Shell study explored the feasibility of chemically recycling plastic, and concluded that chemical recycling of plastic waste was technically viable with the appropriate plastic feedstock. There would also be carbon savings from the diversion of plastic waste from incineration. Concurrently, we embarked on a feasibility study for a Plastic Recovery Facility (PRF). As there are currently no local facilities to recover contaminated plastics from domestic waste, the PRF will fill this gap by taking in domestic waste collected from households and trade premises, to sort and recover various plastic polymer types such as Polyethylene and Polypropylene for further treatment in chemical recycling plants. Completed in end-2021, the study provided an understanding of the design, suitable waste management technologies and equipment, as well as site requirements and scalability potential for a PRF. NEA will further assess the findings from both studies before proceeding with the next stage of development.  \nImproving Industry Energy Performance\nOn 22 December 2021, the energy management system (EnMS) requirements took effect as an enhancement of the Energy Conservation Act to support Singapore’s climate pledge under the Paris Agreement. Energy-intensive companies in the industrial sector, accounting for more than 60 per cent of Singapore’s GHG emissions, are required to implement an EnMS as part of corporate energy management practices, to achieve continual improvement in energy performance. The EnMS is based on the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle and comprises key elements of ISO 50001 - Energy Management System standard. Companies operating the most energy-intensive facilities (≥500TJ/year) have submitted their first EnMS reports by 31 December 2021, while the remaining companies operating the next tier of energy-intensive facilities will submit their EnMS reports by 31 December 2022.\nGoing ForwardIn the short-term, NEA’s focus is to implement regulatory measures for our priority waste streams, develop our chemical recycling capabilities, and increase recycling rates. We also seek to reduce GHG emissions to meet our obligations under the Paris Agreement, and enhance energy efficiency efforts in households, industries and the private sector. Internally, we will drive initiatives within the organisation to align to GreenGov.SG.Our medium-term priority is to innovate and develop the next generation of waste management infrastructure and capabilities, as we work towards becoming a Zero Waste Nation. NEA will also look into circular economy initiatives that seek to extend Semakau Landfill’s lifespan, such as exploring the use of landfilled mixed material as reclamation fill, studying the development of a commercial NEWSand, and developing solutions for non-incinerable waste.\nMitigating the Impact of Hydrofluorocarbons\nIn September 2021, the Environmental Protection and Management (Amendment) Bill was passed in Parliament to mandate measures to mitigate the GHG impact of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are used as refrigerants in Refrigeration and Air-conditioning (RAC) equipment.  \nThe regulatory measures, which come into effect from October 2022, will restrict the supply of RAC equipment that use high Global Warming Potential refrigerants, and require at least one certified technician to supervise or carry out servicing work on water-cooled chillers that involve refrigerant handling.  \nIn June 2022, Singapore ratified the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. To meet these obligations, Singapore will phase down the consumption of HFCs by 80 per cent over the next two decades. NEA will continue to work closely with industry stakeholders to support them in reducing HFC consumption, and shift them towards climate-friendly alternatives.\nReducing Disposable Carrier Bags\nStarting from mid-2023, supermarket operators will be required to charge for disposable carrier bags, to encourage shoppers to adopt more sustainable habits such as bringing their own bags and reducing the use of disposable bags. Supermarket operators with an annual turnover of more than $100 million will need to charge a minimum of five cents for each disposable carrier bag provided at their physical stores. To uphold transparency and accountability, the supermarket operators will also be required to publish information on the number of bags issued, amount of proceeds collected, and how the proceeds are used. The operators are strongly encouraged to use the proceeds to support charitable or environmental causes.\n\n[1] 2020 waste and recycling statistics were impacted by COVID-19, as overall waste generated and overall waste disposed of fell by 19 per cent and five per cent respectively as compared to 2019. For more details, visit www.nea.gov.sg/media/news/news/index/reduction-in-overall-waste-generation-in-2020-with-less-waste-sent-to-semakau-landfill \n[2] The resumption of economic activities and normalisation of business and social activities over 2021 led to a 10 per cent and 26 per cent increase in the amounts of waste disposed of and waste recycled respectively, as compared to 2020. In comparison to the pre-COVID-19 pandemic period in 2019, 2021 saw five per cent more waste disposed of and 11 per cent less waste recycled.

      "content": "SINGAPORE: The overall recycling rate in Singapore has declined from 62 per cent to 52 per cent over the last decade, according to the National Environment Agency’s (NEA) latest statistics on waste and recycling.\nIn particular, paper recycling dropped from more than 50 per cent in 2013 to 31 per cent in 2023. This is largely due to structural factors such as freight costs and commodity prices, the agency said in a media release on Wednesday (Jun 19).\nAdvertisement [...] The latest statistics also showed that the domestic recycling rate remained at 12 per cent, while the non-domestic recycling rate decreased from 72 per cent in 2022 to 67 per cent.

This is largely due to structural factors such as freight costs and commodity prices, the agency said in a media release on Wednesday (Jun 19).\nAdvertisement\nIn 2023, about 6.86 million tonnes of solid waste were generated, of which 3.55 million tonnes were recycled. This amounts to an overall recycling rate of 52 per cent, down from 57 per cent in 2022.\nUnder Singapore’s Zero Waste Masterplan, the country aims to increase its overall recycling rate to 70 per cent by 2030.\nThe drop is due to the amount of construction and demolition waste - which is almost completely recycled - \"dropping significantly\" last year, said NEA.\nConstruction and demolition waste, which is a key industrial waste stream that is generated in large amounts, decreased by more than 40 per cent in 2023 compared to 2022, as there were fewer demolition projects, the agency explained.\nSharp year-on-year changes in the amount of waste would result in \"huge fluctuations\" to the overall recycling rates, NEA added.\nAdvertisement\nThe latest statistics also showed that the domestic recycling rate remained at 12 per cent, while the non-domestic recycling rate decreased from 72 per cent in 2022 to 67 per cent.\n\nRelated:\n\nIN FOCUS: Where do the recyclables that you place in blue bins end up?\n\nAbout 72% of Singapore households say they recycle: NEA survey\nDECREASE IN DOMESTIC WASTE\nThe domestic waste generated per capita - collected from households and trade premises such as schools and hawker centres - also decreased by more than 15 per cent over the last decade.\nIn 2023, the daily domestic waste generated per capita was 0.88kg, down from 1.08kg in 2013.\nNon-domestic waste per dollar Gross Domestic Product generated at industrial and commercial premises also fell from 40 tonnes in 2013 to 26 tonnes last year - a more than 30 per cent drop.\nThe decrease in waste generated indicates that households and companies have taken \"positive steps\" to reduce and reuse, said NEA.\nAdvertisement\nThe agency added that it will continue to study new ways to close the various resource loops. This includes looking into using mixed materials from Singapore's only landfill Semakau - which is made up of incineration ashes and other waste materials - for reclamation.\nDuring a speech at the joint opening of the Singapore International Water Week and CleanEnviro Summit on Wednesday, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu said that the government is exploring new technologies that could generate higher-value products from mixed solid waste, while also reducing carbon emissions.\nNEA will assess the information gathered on the industry’s interests and the commercial viability of these technologies, she said.\nWhere suitable, pilot trials may be conducted to evaluate the potential of expansion to full-size disposal facilities, added Ms Fu.\nNEA on Wednesday highlighted that there is a \"greater urgency\" for everyone to build a sustainability culture to reduce, reuse, and recycle.\nAdvertisement\n\"By reducing waste and recycling right, we can do our part to combat climate change and ensure that Singapore remains clean, green, and liveable,\" it added.\n\nDaily Cuts: What will it take for Singaporeans to recycle more?\nSource: CNA/ng(rj)\nSign up for our newsletters\nGet our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox\nSubscribe here\n\nGet the CNA app\nStay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories\nDownload here\n\nGet WhatsApp alerts\nJoin our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app\nJoin here\n\nRelated Topics\nNational Environment Agency Recycling Waste\nAdvertisement\nAlso worth reading\n\nKim Soo-hyun scandal: Released explicit photo allegedly shows actor at Kim Sae-ron’s home, brands cut ties\n\nActress Sora Ma snaps back at netizens who say she looks too happy after husband’s death\n\nSouth Korean actress Lee Si-young divorces husband after eight years of marriage\n\nActor Desmond Ng marries longtime partner Kanny Theng, proposed with a watch instead of a ring\nPartner Recommendations\n From routine to ritual: Aesop elevates the daily shower with Eleos Nourishing Body Cleanser\n Louisville Homeowners: Here's the estimated cost of installing 6+ windows in 2025 ProFind\n 5 Signs It Could Be Time to Fire Your Advisor smartasset.com\n Experts Highlight Advancements in Parkinson’s Support SeekerHub\nAdvertisement\nExpand to read the full story\nGet bite-sized news via a new\ncards interface.

They will then have to be disposed of, incinerated, and landfilled.\"\nUnder Singapore’s Zero Waste Masterplan and the Singapore Green Plan, the country aims to increase its overall recycling rate to 70 per cent by 2030.\nIn response to CNA's queries, NEA said on Tuesday (Sep 19) that it derived the 72 per cent figure from the question “Does your household recycle?\", to which respondents would answer with yes or no.\nNEA added that recycling was defined in the survey as depositing recyclables into blue recycling bins or chutes, sending recyclables to rag-and-bone men (karung guni) or participating in recycling drives.\n\"The 72 per cent figure reflects the proportion of households that participated in some form of recycling. It does not take into account how much each household recycles,\" the agency said.\nAdvertisement\nThe overall recycling rate in Singapore rose to 57 per cent in 2022 from 55 per cent in 2021 and 52 per cent in 2020.\nThis rate considers the tonnage of recyclables collected from households, trade premises, industrial and commercial premises, said NEA.\n\nRelated:\n\nAbout 6% more waste generated in Singapore in 2022; recycling rate increased slightly\n\nThree in five households recycled regularly: NEA survey\nThis year’s Recycle Right campaign includes an online game and bite-sized educational videos showcasing how recycling can easily be incorporated into aspects of daily life, such as buying takeaways and making online purchases.\nTo lower contamination rates, town councils with dual-chute estates are installing chute stickers to remind residents what can be recycled, said NEA.\nSenior Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and the Environment Baey Yam Keng launched the latest Recycle Right campaign at Anchor Green Primary School on Thursday.\nAdvertisement\n“NEA continues to work with various partners and stakeholders, including schools, the community, non-governmental organisations, corporate, and industry partners to encourage households to recycle more and recycle right,” the agency said.\n“This is done by making recycling and recycling information more accessible in neighbourhoods and homes,” it added.\nA reusable home recycling box called Bloobox was distributed to every household from March to April this year to encourage recycling.\nEach Housing Board block, landed house, and condominium or private apartment block has its own recycling bin or chute. The bins are coloured blue to differentiate them from the general waste bins.\n\nRecycling habits starts with children - Listen to the Daily Cuts:\n\nRelated:\n\n93% of free home recycling boxes distributed by Apr 30: Baey Yam Keng\nSource: CNA/cm(mi)(jo)\nSign up for our newsletters\nGet our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox\nSubscribe here\n\nGet the CNA app\nStay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories\nDownload here\n\nGet WhatsApp alerts\nJoin our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app\nJoin here\n\nRelated Topics\nNEA Recycling Waste\nAdvertisement\nAlso worth reading\nContent is loading...\nPartner Recommendations\n Elevate your daily shower\n Remove Ads On Your Windows, It Is As Easy As This lifestyletechtips.com\n Stay Private Online with the Free Email Built for Security and Simplicity Proton Mail\n Louisville: Seniors Choosing Contemporary Living Spaces Go Find You\nAdvertisement\nExpand to read the full story\nGet bite-sized news via a new\ncards interface.

There is no publicly available data for subsequent years.\nBuilding recycling facilities requires land, which is a precious commodity in Singapore.\nMr Cheang Kok Chung, executive director of the Singapore Environment Council, said: “Given the size of Singapore’s domestic market, there may not be sufficient recyclable feedstock to support large recycling facilities that are able to reap economies of scale.\n“Furthermore, some recycling processes can be resource-intensive, in terms of land, water or energy.”\nRecycling facilities, some featuring innovative technologies, have been under development for several years.\nIn 2023, Abraclean, the first recycling plant in Singapore that can repurpose glass waste into an abrasive that removes unwanted coatings such as rust and paint from metal surfaces in industrial applications, was officially opened.\nAbraclean chairman Gurmit Singh said the company has already met the target of recycling 3,500 tonnes of glass waste in May, and that it is in talks to upscale its capabilities to recycle up to 35,000 tonnes of glass waste by processing construction and vehicle glass each year.\nRecycling start-up Magorium was founded in 2019 to turn plastic waste into road construction material.\nIn February 2023, the Land Transport Authority said that it was in discussions with Magorium to trial its bitumen-like product, NewBitumen, on public roads.\nMagorium founder Oh Shu Xian said that the company has paved nine roads – including driveways at the DBS Newton Green building, a condominium in Marymount, and a road near the Sentosa Sensoryscape attraction – and converted close to 100 tonnes of plastic waste into NewBitumen.\nMore on this Topic\naskST: What is recycling contamination, and what can we do about it? Recycle-me-not: What happens when the wrong things get recycled\nInternational developments\nSince the bulk of Singapore’s recyclables have to be exported, the local recycling business is also subject to regulations that govern the transboundary movement of waste.\nThe Basel Convention, enacted in 1998, controls the international movement of hazardous and certain categories of non-hazardous waste such as household waste or residue from the incineration of household waste.\nThe convention was expanded to include contaminated, mixed or non-recyclable plastics in 2021.\nPrior to the amendments, exporters were able to ship contaminated mixed and non-recyclable plastics across Singapore’s borders without obtaining consent from the countries receiving them.\nIn 2018, China’s “National Sword” policy banned the import of most plastics and other materials.\nThe country had previously processed nearly half of the world’s recyclables for more than two decades.\nPrior to the changes, Singapore exported a substantial portion of its recyclables to China for processing. The ban’s restrictions made exporting much more difficult, especially for lower-quality or contaminated materials.\nMore recently, global shipping has been thrown into disarray as ships take longer routes to bypass dangerous attacks in the Red Sea.\nRerouting of shipping routes has led to increased operational costs, such as rises in fuel consumption.\nMs JacQueline Lim, managing director of Tai Hing Group, a local paper recycling company, said current freight costs have increased about three to four times more than usual, which is worse than during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nMs Rheaume said: “These developments mean that transport costs will get pushed up. This makes the cost of purchasing waste materials from Singapore even more expensive, reducing demand for our recyclables.\n“So we can expect this will have a negative impact on recycling rates.”\nGenerating less waste\nSingapore is moving to be more self-sufficient in processing its waste, which could subject recycling companies here to fewer fluctuations in global supply chains. This could, in turn, help lift recycling rates.\nBut Singapore’s recycling infrastructure will take time to improve, given that the development of recycling capabilities and facilities is still in progress.\nTuas Nexus – an integrated waste and water treatment facility that can sort household recyclables and process food waste, on top of treating industrial used water for industrial use – is slated to be completed in phases from 2025 onwards.\nReducing waste should be prioritised instead of relying on recycling, Ms Rheaume said.\nAlready, Singapore’s one and only landfill in Semakau is expected to be fully filled by 2035, instead of 2045.\nThere are already encouraging signs.\nNEA statistics showed that in 2023, each person generated 0.88kg of rubbish a day. This is less than the 0.9kg figure in 2022.\nMs Rheaume said that it was a good sign that the waste generated per person has reduced.\nUnder the Zero Waste Masterplan, Singapore aims to reduce the waste sent to the landfill each day by 30 per cent by 2030, so as to extend the landfill’s lifespan beyond 2035.\nSaid Ms Rheaume: “The bigger problem is consumption in the first place. And we’ve got a lot of consumption. Even really great recycling systems aren’t going to save us from the climate change impact of our consumption.”\nShe added: “Keep finding ways to not use so much single-use material. Avoid single-use glass for sure. Avoid single-use plastic. Don’t just substitute one single-use item for another.”\nMore on this Topic\nOnly 15% of people surveyed are aware of S’pore’s net-zero emission target: Study Smart recycling boxes and lockers for another 83 locations in S’pore\nAlready a subscriber? Log in\nUnlimited coverage, unmatched value\nGet Digital Access\nGet Digital Access\nMonthly Savings  \n$9.90 $5/month\nSubscribe today!\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\nMonthly Recurring  \n$9.90/month\nSubscribe now\nNo lock-in contract.\nSubscriber-exclusive benefits for One Digital Package:\n\nAccess all subscriber-only content on ST app and straitstimes.com.\nEasy access any time via ST app on one mobile device.\nmyST: Follow up to 30 authors and 30 topics.\n\nJoin ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.\nRecyclingWaste managementCommodity marketEnvironmental issuesSustainability\nThanks for sharing!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFROM AROUND THE WEB\n\n Ad Amazon's Worst Nightmare: Thousands Canceling Prime for This Clever Hack Learn More Online Shopping Tools  Ad is Hidden Please tell us why you hid this ad? * Inappropriate * Misleading * Misinformation * Repetitive * Irrelevant * Distracting\n Ad Windows Users Didn't Know This Simple Trick To Block All Ads (Do It Now) Click Here lifestyletechtips.com  Ad is Hidden Please tell us why you hid this ad? * Inappropriate * Misleading * Misinformation * Repetitive * Irrelevant * Distracting\n Ad Windows Users Don't Forget To Do This Before Thursday Read more Securitytipsonline.com  Ad is Hidden Please tell us why you hid this ad? * Inappropriate * Misleading * Misinformation * Repetitive * Irrelevant * Distracting\n Ad A.I.

As in many developed countries around the world, the government introduced a National Recycling Program to increase domestic recycling rates in response to dwindling landfill space. However, in the nearly two decades since the program was introduced, recycling rates increased only marginally and remain around twenty percent, much lower than comparable countries in Asia. Yet Singapore also has a longstanding informal recycling sector, known as karang guni (Malay for ‘gunny sack’). Primarily independent operators at the scale of one truck, karang guni drive through public housing estates and private housing neighborhoods honking a horn to indicate their presence and purchasing certain recyclable items. Although most commentators consider the karang guni a ‘vanishing trade’ that will soon be replaced by the official National Recycling Program, they remain today the primary recycling routes for newspapers and E-waste.\nA classic modernization narrative would suggest that large-scale, centralized, big-technology–such as multinational Public Waste Collectors and Material Recovery Facilities (MRFs)–will outperform and replace the informal karang guni. This presentation describes an ongoing experiment to use community and participatory design practices to introduce a mobile app platform into the karang guni system in order to increase trust and communication in ways that could enhance the efficiency of recycling outcomes and improve livelihoods for karang guni recyclers. A collaboration between anthropologists and engineers, the experiment will test how digital technologies might transform informal recycling networks. Can small-scale, informal, and familiarity-based exchange networks provide more efficient and effective recycling outcomes than the National Recycling Program, challenging outdated modernization narratives? How will replacing the karang guni horn with a mobile app transform modes of work, social structures of labor and capital?  Finally, by combining data collected by the app in a cloud platform with on-the-ground participant observation, what can we learn about the economy and ecology of informal recycling?\n===\nPrivacy Policy\n©2025 Society for Social Studies of Science\n\n\n\n\n"

NEA is doing good work to increase recycling efforts2. Increase collaboration with the informal recycling sector\nNEA's reply:\nThis is a full version of NEA's reply issued to the media agency; published in The Straits Times, 3 May 2018. \nWe would like to thank Mr Nicholas Ng Yu Heng for his letter.  \nThe National Recycling Programme (NRP) was established to complement the collection of recyclables by the informal recycling sector, such as karang guni and organisers of community events and charity drives. Under the NRP, the National Environment Agency (NEA) provides households with an accessible, reliable and convenient avenue to recycle so as to encourage more households to recycle. Blue recycling bins for comingled recyclables are placed at every block in public housing estates and are provided to every household living in landed homes. It is also mandatory for all condominiums to have recycling bins within their estates. In fact, the amount of recyclables collected under the NRP has been steadily rising, and accounted for 11 per cent by weight of recyclables collected from households in 2017, up from 6 per cent in 2010.  \nTo make recycling even more convenient, new public housing developments launched since 2014 are fitted with dual chutes for refuse and recyclables. The measure will also apply to new non-landed private residential development applications submitted to URA from 1 April 2018. With these chutes in place, households will find it just as convenient to recycle as to dispose of their waste.  \nTo raise awareness of recycling in general, NEA provides information on proper recycling habits on its website and the myENV mobile app, and ‘3R’ videos on Youtube. NEA also works with schools and other community partners on public education programmes to promote recycling habits at home.  \nWe concur with Mr Ng that we must be responsible consumers and that active participation in recycling by all residents is key to improving our domestic recycling rate. We will continue to explore new measures to improve our domestic recycling rate as we work towards our vision of Singapore as a Zero Waste Nation.  \nOng Soo San\nDirector, Waste and Resource Management Department\nNational Environment Agency\nBack toTop\nOur Related Sites\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nHow can I help?\n\n\nAsk Captain Green\nRate chat\nDownload Transcript\nPowered by GovTech\n Share\n Share\n Tweet\n Share\n Share\n\n\nWE CARE ABOUT YOUR PRIVACY\nManage Settings\nVendors\nVendor Settings\nPurposes\nVendors can:\nStore and/or access information on a device\nUse limited data to select advertising\nCreate profiles for personalised advertising\nUse profiles to select personalised advertising\nCreate profiles to personalise content\nUse profiles to select personalised content\nMeasure advertising performance\nMeasure content performance\nUnderstand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources\nDevelop and improve services\nUse limited data to select content\nSpecial Purposes\nVendors can:\n\nEnsure security, prevent and detect fraud, and fix errors\nDeliver and present advertising and content\nSave and communicate privacy choices\n\nFeatures\nVendors can:\n\nMatch and combine data from other data sources\nLink different devices\nIdentify devices based on information transmitted automatically\n\nSpecial Features\nVendors can:\nUse precise geolocation data\nActively scan device characteristics for identification\nSome partners do not ask for your consent to process your data, instead, they rely on their legitimate business interest.

Recycling, the act of converting waste into useful products, is actively promoted by the National Environment Agency (NEA) and encouraged through the ubiquitous blue recycling bins around our housing estates.\n\nYet, last year, Singapore saw a disappointingly low total recycling rate of 52 per cent, the lowest in 10 years, with our domestic recycling rate at a measly 13 per cent.\n\nOur dismal recycling rate is worrying and also baffling, considering that recycling can have so many benefits for us. It helps to conserve our natural resources, lower our carbon footprint by reducing the amount of waste we incinerate at our waste-to-energy incineration plants, and also extend the lifespan of Semakau Landfill — Singapore’s only landfill — which is predicted to run out of space by 2035 at our present rate of waste growth.\n\nSingapore’s recycling system & culture\n\nTo give an overview of Singapore’s recycling system, let’s look at the National Recycling Programme. Launched back in April 2001, it provides recycling bins and collection services by NEA-licensed public waste collectors. The blue recycling bins collect different types of recyclables (paper, plastic, glass, and metal), which are then sorted at materials recovery facilities before being sent to recycling facilities for additional processing. There is also the informal recycling sector with our familiar garang gunis (rag-and-bone men) collecting our recyclables.\n\nThe Singapore government has also been encouraging recycling habits through various initiatives such as the Green Plan 2030 and the more targeted Zero Waste Masterplan.\n\nFor instance, two initiatives under the Zero Waste Masterplan are the introduction of recyclables chutes and e-waste recycling. Having a recyclables chute, in addition to the conventional rubbish chute in various high-rise housing flats, will enable residents to conveniently dispose of their recyclables separately from waste.\n\nAnother initiative is the recently implemented e-waste collection and disposal scheme which will enable us to deposit our unwanted electronic devices into dedicated e-waste recycling bins, at collective drives or using disposal services for bulky appliances. This is particularly important as e-waste is predicted to surge in the future.\n\nNonetheless, it is not an understatement to say that Singapore has a weak recycling culture. Many people recycle only when they feel that it is convenient enough for them — throwing all waste down the chute in the comfort of their own homes is much easier than separating the recyclables from general waste and then going through the hassle of heading downstairs to deposit them into the communal blue bins. This is especially for the majority of housing flats in Singapore, which are not fitted with a recyclables chute.\n\nThere is also a lack of knowledge on how to recycle properly, such as how to prepare items for recycling as well as what can be recycled in the first place. For instance, some may not know that food and beverage containers need to be cleaned before they are recycled, and may even regard it as a hassle, opting to throw it down a regular rubbish chute instead.\n\nTo sum up, recycling is simply a voluntary activity for many in Singapore and there is no strong obligation to engage in it despite the environmental benefits, leading to our abysmal recycling rates.\n\nHow other societies have reached greener pastures\n\nA good recycling culture can be consciously built-up, as proven in the case studies of other successful places. Some Asian societies who have cultivated strong recycling cultures include South Korea and Taiwan, and perhaps we can take a leaf out of their books.\n\nSouth Korea is the third best country in recycling, according to a 2018 Eunomia report. In a system that is significantly more robust and stricter than Singapore’s recycling programmes, South Koreans are required to separate their household trash into different categories for collection — namely recyclables, food waste and general waste.\n\nThe country uses a volume-based waste fee system in which households pay according to how much general trash they generate, while recyclables are collected free of charge. They also have a mandatory food waste recycling programme in which they are charged according to the weight of their bags of wasted food which are then recycled as fertiliser. These additional fees not only motivate the Koreans to reduce their waste, they also cultivate the habit of recycling.\n\nTaiwan — once infamously known as ‘Garbage Island’ — has drastically transformed their image today, thanks to a 4-in-1 recycling programme that brings together its government, manufacturers, recycling enterprises, and the people to form a recycling network.\n\nManufacturers contribute to a Recycling Fund which subsidises the recycling disposal system. Consumers must segregate their waste into three categories — recyclables, organic waste and general waste. Using a pay-as-you-throw approach, the Taiwanese must buy official blue bags for general trash while the disposal of recyclables is free. They are also incentivised to recycle more at recycling booths that allows them to add value to their metro system access cards for every bottle or can they deposit.\n\nIn addition, it is compulsory for all high school students and government workers to attend a minimum of four hours in environmental education classes yearly. The recycling habit is also inculcated in schools as students are asked to separate their trash, helping them to adapt to sorting recyclables.\n\nThese measures are in stark contrast to the waste management approach we have in Singapore. Our waste collection system is so convenient and we do not need to worry about separating our trash into different categories — even our blue recycling bins collect all types of recyclables into one place.\n\nWe are able to throw away our rubbish very easily into chutes and dustbins, with no enforcement whatsoever on whether we are recycling correctly (40 per cent of items in our recycling bins are not recyclable due to contamination) or even limiting the amount of waste we generate. These translate into a greater ease of not recycling. After all, as the saying goes, “out of sight, out of mind”.\n\nPerhaps it is this very laxity that has contributed to our weak recycling culture, as well as a wider nonchalant attitude towards the trash we produce with little attention paid to the negative effects that our planet will have to bear.\n\nIncentives — sustainable or not?\n\nTo that end, incentives can be said to be a good first step in nudging people in the right direction, although its sustainability is another issue altogether.\n\nWhile Singapore currently has no regulations mandating the domestic recycling of our waste, the Government has experimented with incentive schemes to encourage more people to recycle.\n\nOne such initiative is the rollout of Reverse Vending Machines, which rewards those who deposit at least ten empty drink cans or plastic bottles at one time into the machines.\n\nAnother programme is the Cash-for-Trash scheme in which people can bring their recyclables to Cash-for-Trash stations and in exchange for cash from public waste collectors. By 2022, NEA will also be implementing the Deposit Refund Scheme to take back and recycle drinks packaging, with refunds for consumers.\n\nHowever, incentives are only a short-term solution at best. They would not be sustainable to fund and have also been proven to have limited effectiveness in spurring people in Singapore to recycle when the benefits do not outweigh the inertia to recycle. While incentives have worked in societies like Taiwan, they were successful by complementing these incentives with regulations like the pay-as-you-throw approach to get the engine going. By mandating people to recycle, such societies were able to get their residents accustomed to recycling as a habit.\n\nUltimately, the root of the issue is our mindset towards recycling and whether we see it as a necessity amidst our hectic daily lives, as admittedly, it can be hard to see the long-term benefits from the get go. Hence, we could look into more educational ways to increase environmental awareness in society and get people accustomed to the right recycling habits.\n\nIdeally, education should start from school-going age to inculcate the right habits from young, such as by incorporating environmental content into the school curriculum. For society at large, educational campaigns can also be complemented with rules to ‘force’ people to be more conscious of our waste and gradually build up a stronger recycling culture.\n\nWaste is everyone’s issue and all stakeholders should have a part to play. Hence, the authorities could also enact more extended producer responsibility rules to mandate corporations with operations in Singapore to be responsible for the waste they create from their manufacturing processes as well as their products at the end-of-life cycle. With a concerted effort among different stakeholders in society, each group will feel it is not their burden alone to bear and everyone in the country is working towards the common goal of a greener future.\n\nThe 3R way to an environmentally-friendly future\n\nBroadly, we can afford to learn how other societies have tackled their waste problem using a combination of regulations, facilities, incentives, and most importantly, a concerted effort amongst various stakeholders in society with a common recognition that their actions will be good for the society and the planet.\n\nWhile there is no one-size-fits-all approach to waste management, Singapore shares similar characteristics with the above-mentioned societies, such as ubiquitous high-rise housing and high population densities, and hence there is potential for reference-taking. Waste will become more of an issue in the future as our population continues to grow and more resources continue to be consumed, but we still have a long way to go in cultivating a good recycling culture and a better attitude towards waste management at large.\n\nIn the grand scheme of saving the environment, however, recycling should only be a last resort in how we, as individuals and as a part of households, manage our waste. As mentioned in the beginning, recycling is only one of our three R’s. Reducing and reusing should always come first — we should strive to reduce the amount of waste we create and reuse what is still usable. Every single effort matters; as individuals, we can start off by being more conscious of our trash and really only purchase what we need.\n\nWe are all using the Earth’s resources for our survival, consumption, and enjoyment. The least we could do is to reduce the amount of waste we create for the planet; not for anyone else, but for helping to forge a better life for our future generations.\n\nFOLLOW US ON TELEGRAM AND INSTAGRAM TO KEEP UP TO DATE WITH OUR POSTS!\n\nShare this article:\n\nInstagram/Twitter/LinkedIn\n\nDesigned with WordPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

(环宝), an app for mobile phones designed to support Singapore’s heritage recycling economy, traditionally known as the karung guni trade. The Honk! app aims to simultaneously increase the domestic recycling rate and improve economic opportunities for small-scale, often elderly recycling entrepreneurs.\n\n\n\nFearnley led the design and development of the Honk! app, with funding from the SUTD-MIT International Design Centre. Since 2017, Fearnley and his research team conducted anthropological fieldwork and design workshops that uncovered the challenges and potentials in the contemporary karung guni trade. Drawing on these research insights, Fearnley and collaborators designed a mobile app that creates new digital connections and virtual marketplaces linking karung guni traders and household residents.\n\nThe Honk! (环宝) app, showing items listed for collection by karung guni in map view\n\nIn March this year, the Design Business Chamber Singapore (DBCS) awarded Honk! an SG Mark, referred to as Singapore’s “benchmark of good design and quality.” At the DBCS Gala Dinner in May, the DBCS also awarded Honk! an SG Mark Special Mention, awarded to only four projects in 2019 (https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/home-design/a-mark-of-success).\n\n\n\nRemarkably, around 90% of Singapore’s domestic recycled waste is collected by informal karung guni, not government-contracted Public Waste Collectors (PWCs).  Yet many still believe the karung guni is a ‘vanishing trade’ that will be unable to keep up with rising transport costs and emerging technologies. Fearnley and collaborators designed and built Honk! to challenge the assumption that traditional trades and technological futures can’t be put together.\n\n\n\nKarung guni travel block to block, honking their iconic hand-held horn to notify residents of their presence. Honk!, built for Android and Apple iOS devices, utilizes cellular network technology to allow households and karung guni to connect and initiate trades in the data ‘cloud’.  With GPS to provide location data for both karung guni and households, photo snap-posting of items, notification ‘honks’ and advance scheduling, the Honk! app expands and streamlines the karung guni economy for the digital era.\n\nUseful information\n\nConnect with us\n\nSocial Media\n\nCopyright © 2011 – 2025\n\n"
