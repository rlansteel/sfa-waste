This is also down year-on-year from 7.4 million tonnes in 2022.\nHowever, the country’s overall recycling rate declined from 62% to 52% between 2013 and 2023. While non-ferrous metal and ferrous metal from construction and demolition each had a recycling rate of 99% last year, just 5% of plastics – 48,000 tonnes – were recycled.\nAdd to this the fact that textile/leather and food had recycling rates of 2% (5,000 tonnes) and 18% (132,000 tonnes) respectively last year, and it becomes clear that the need for a long-term solution to tackle overconsumption is great.\n**Green movements\n**As part of its Zero Waste Masterplan and Green Plan, which were launched in 2019 and 2021 respectively, Singapore aims to improve its overall recycling rate to 70% by 2030. The island, which is just 734.3km2 in size and home to more than six million people, also plans to reduce the amount of waste per capita it sends to landfill by 30%.\n\nSo given that Singapore’s only landfill site, Semakau, is set to be full by 2035, what are the country and wider organisations doing to meet these targets and close the waste loop?\nWhile the National Environment Agency (NEA), Singapore’s government agency in charge of planning, developing and administering the county’s waste management systems, refused various requests to comment, it did highlight a number of ongoing initiatives.\nThese include the establishment of a new alliance aimed at reducing packaging waste in the e-commerce sector and a beverage container return scheme (BCRS) due to launch in 2026.\nThe NEA has also awarded more than S$6m (£3.6m) to three projects aimed at diverting plastic waste from incineration by either improving the recyclability of contaminated and hard-to-recycle plastics, or by developing sustainable packaging solutions that use recycled plastic materials and are easy to recycle.\n**Zero-waste challenges\n**Rémi Cesaro, founder of consultancy Zero Waste City, provides advice to companies in Singapore that are looking to reduce their waste and ultimately achieve zero-waste scores.\n\nCost, habit and caring about waste and recycling are the main challenges for Singapore, he believes. “In the private sector, if the volume of waste is not sufficient, you will most likely have to pay an extra fee to transport it,” Cesaro says. “Even if it’s a small cost, some organisations may be reluctant to pay it.”\nOne new regulation that Cesaro welcomes is the food-waste segregation and reporting framework. Under this, large food-waste producers such as factories, hotels and shopping malls have to segregate their food waste for treatment.\nIn terms of recycling, he highlights the upcoming extended producer responsibility approach for packaging-waste management, which the BCRS will fall under.\nThe lack of visibility in the waste disposal process, which includes segregation, collection, sorting and treatment, is a concern in Singapore, Cesaro says.\n“Cities that tend to be good at achieving zero-waste targets decentralise waste management to make it closer to people so they can see how much waste is being generated. The idea is to mitigate the concept of ‘out of sight, out of mind’, which might drive change.”\nTextile collection\nOne company doing this is Cloop, which collects textiles and apparel for reuse, repurposing and recirculation through its recycling bins, swap events, thrift pop-ups and educational workshops.\nCloop introduced Singapore’s first textile bin as part of a partnership with Life Line Clothing in July 2022, and now has more than 450 bins nationwide.\n\n“These help divert some textile waste away from landfill to a more targeted recycler that will then segregate it into more than 500 categories for international circulation,” co-founder and eco-warrior Jasmine Tuan explains. “It just goes to show how much waste and overconsumption there is in Singapore.”\nTuan believes one reason for the recycling rate decline in recent years is a failed system. “We want to recycle and do the right thing, but the system doesn’t support that behaviour, or consumers don’t have the awareness of who’s doing what,” she says.\n“It doesn’t help that Singapore’s waste management system is primarily dependent on incineration – our four incineration plants produce energy from waste. Now there is also research and development to turn the ash at Semakau landfill into something, so there’s no reason for us to reduce our waste in general. It’s a good solution for Singapore, but it’s not the best. Resources still go to waste here because of convenience and state-of-the-art waste management.”\nFor example, Tuan says students advocate sustainability, but when they segregate waste at school, the cleaners put it all together in a general waste bin that goes straight to incineration. “That discourages people who want to do the right thing, so we have to work together – the system has to help people,” she says.\nSince its creation in 2020, Cloop has collected close to 5,000 tonnes of textiles through its recycling bins and rehomed 23,000 items of clothing at its swap events. The company’s aim, Tuan says, is to double the current textile recycling rate in Singapore.\n“Our vision is to be a go-to resource hub for all things circular fashion, so for any material, or shopping or buying bundle, we have a solution under that one roof. It’s also a space for the community to come together to learn skills from one another – mending or experimenting using fabric waste,” she explains.\nPlastic projects\nBeyond Singapore, ocean impact organisation Seven Clean Seas is on a mission to remove 10 million kilograms of plastic from our oceans by the end of 2025. With numerous plastic crediting projects across South-East Asia, including Indonesia and Thailand, Seven Clean Seas has successfully removed 4.5 million kilograms of plastic so far.\n\n“Our goal is to build projects that intercept and prevent plastic from reaching the environment, as well as clean up plastic that’s already in coastal communities,” says Tom Peacock-Nazil (pictured left), founder and CEO of Seven Clean Seas.\nWhile plastic credits are a useful tool, he says, they don’t replace the need for upstream reduction, investment in the circular economy, or regulations to mandate the reduction of plastic production in the first place.\nOther innovative solutions the company has developed include corrugated roof tiles made out of shopping bags. “Almost all communities in coastal regions in Indonesia are choosing not to use tin because it corrodes in the salt air,” explains Peacock-Nazil. “They were using pure asbestos and had no clue about the negative health implications.\n“Building regulations have now been passed for our corrugated roof tiles to be used in Indonesia. They’ve got the corrosion resistance capabilities that asbestos roofs would have, but they’re made from waste. “At the same time, it’s a mono polymer – low-density polyethylene – so at the end of its life, we can shred it up and mix it with more recycled plastic and turn it into more roof tiles.”  \nIn addition, Peacock-Nazil says: “Our high-density polyethylene bottle caps and polypropylene food pots can get turned into big sheets that we’re now making into furniture and tabletops.”\nFor multi-layered and small-format packaging that’s highly contaminated, he says, Seven Clean Seas is mixing it with sand to make fire-retardant building bricks.  \n“Our recycling rates are sitting at around 15% today, which I’m incredibly proud about considering all the materials are degraded and contaminated,” Peacock-Nazil says. “It also beats the 9% plastic recycling rate globally.”\nThe road ahead\nThe solution for the little red dot, as Singapore is commonly known, lies in regulation, Peacock-Nazil and Cesaro believe.\n“Singapore has this unique scenario where you cannot move the needle in circularity easily,” Peacock-Nazil says. “It needs to be led by regulation. The government has an opportunity to be the world’s best at something and they should continue to invest in it.”\nCesaro agrees: “I’m a big believer in regulation – if you want drastic change quickly, regulation is by far the best way.”\nFor further information about Cloop and Seven Clean Seas respectively, see www.cloop.sg and www.sevencleanseas.com\nKatie Smith is a freelance writer and editor\n\nFenland House,\n15B Hostmoor Avenue,\nMarch,\nCambridgeshire,\nPE15 0AX.\n\n\nCall us:\n+44 (0)1522 540069\n*   ### Email us:\ninfo@iema.net\n\n\nPrivacy\n\nTerms\nCookies\nAccessibility\n\nMake a Complaint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© Copyright The Institute of Sustainability and Environmental Professionals 2025\n(formerly the Institute of Environmental Management and Assessment)\nCompany Limited by Guarantee.

The rest is incinerated, with a slight fraction sent to landfill. The landfill \"island,\" called Semakau, was created in 1999 and extended in 2015, with enough space to meet Singapore's waste disposal needs until at least 2035.\nThe waste management industry in Singapore majorly consists of all municipal solid waste (MSW) - including non-hazardous waste generated in households, commercial establishments, and institutions, and non-hazardous industrial process wastes, agricultural wastes, and sewage sludge. The industry's value represents the amount of total typical charge per ton for landfill multiplied by the volume of MSW generated. The industry's volume represents the total MSW generation.\nSingapore Waste Management Market Trends\nGrowing Food and Beverage Sector in Singapore\nSingapore’s food and beverage industry is a vital sector that contributes significantly to the country’s economy. The F&B industry in Singapore has undergone various changes in the last few years, with the COVID-19 pandemic impacting the industry’s growth and trends.\nIn 2022, the recycling rate for food waste generated in Singapore remained at the highest in the measured period, at 18 percent. In comparison, the food waste recycling rate was 13 percent in 2013 and has steadily increased over this period.\nIn Singapore, the impact of climatic shifts and supply disruptions can be distinctly felt by the city-state, which imports more than 90 percent of its food. To address this, the Singapore food agency has committed to gaining greater food resilience by setting a “30 by 30” goal, with the aim of producing 30 percent of local nutritional needs by 2030. However, with less than one percent of land designated for farming, Singapore must produce more with fewer resources. Faced with these challenges, the nation needs to reduce food waste while sustainably increasing food production.\nIn Singapore, food producers generally need help managing food waste due to the high cost of implementing waste management solutions. As a result, the city-state produced an estimated 813,000 tonnes of food waste, accounting for 12 percent of the total waste produced. At the same time, as many as 783 million people worldwide faced hunger in 2022.\n\nUnderstand The Key Trends Shaping This Market\nDownload PDF\nIncrease in E-waste Generation\nSingapore generates about 60,000 tonnes of e-waste annually, which equals 70 devices per person.\nSingapore's overall waste generation rose by 18 per cent last year - the first increase after four years of decline - as economic activity picked up after the loosening of COVID-19 restrictions. In all, about 6.94 million tonnes of solid waste were generated last year 2022, compared with the 5.88 million tonnes in 2020, said the National Environment Agency (NEA) in its annual waste and recycling report.\nTo nudge households to step up their recycling efforts, NEA is also planning to distribute recycling containers to those that want them in the later part of 2022.\nTo ensure compliance, Singapore’s government designated ALBA Group Asia, the regional branch of a German recycling company, as the program operator. The company is now responsible for not just keeping producers accountable, but also overseeing e-waste collection. Producers are required to hand over the waste they collect to ALBA, while the company also organizes collection drives and liaises with town councils to gather waste from across the nation. ALBA has also placed 600 e-waste bins in Singapore’s urban area, making it easy for people to dispose of their used waste.\n\nGet Analysis on Important Geographic Markets\nDownload PDF\nSingapore Waste Management Industry Overview\nSingapore Waste Management looks fragmented, offering many opportunities for new companies to enter the market.

In the last five years, Singapore, with a population of 5.9 million, generated approximately 759 tonnes of food waste on average, thus further deepening food security challenges and imposing enormous pressure on the country’s food and land resources. The Zero Waste Plan and the 30-by-30 food security goal initiated by the Singapore government focus on reducing waste and improving resource efficiency and encourage the collective efforts from the local agri-food businesses to sustainably provide 30% of Singapore’s nutritional requirements by 2030. In recent years, valorizing food waste streams into higher-value products has been an increasing trend in tackling food wastage and offering a new source of food ingredients. Food wastes such as okara, spent barley grains, and fruit and vegetable wastes have been successfully valorized into a variety of prototypes by local research and development capabilities for food and agricultural applications. However, food waste valorization faces various challenges, i.e., infrastructure development, economy viability, consumer awareness, collaborative partnership, regulatory support, and data management. This review serves as a reference for other countries in ensuring food security and achieving sustainable development goals.\nKeywords:\nfood waste; valorization; food security; sustainability; zero waste\n1. Introduction\nThe generation of food waste is a constant global concern to the environment, economics and food security. When large amounts of food are wasted and thrown into the landfill to wait for incineration, methane, which is an extremely potent greenhouse gas, is produced. As the food demand continues to rise, more energy is required to produce the food wastes that were lost, thereby increasing carbon emissions and contributing to climate change and global warming. One of the greatest contributors to climate change is the production of meat-based foods, including livestock feed, which emits twice the greenhouse gases than that of plant-based sources [1]. Economically, the costs spent to produce, process and transport the food, such as water, land and energy resources, are eventually wasted, leading to financial losses. Additional costs to reproduce the food also certainly increase the financial burden on the food industry. In the context of food security, the production of food waste increases the country’s dependency on imported foods as it decreases the amount of food available to be consumed. In hopes of combating the negative effects that are caused by food wastage, this paper aims to shed light on food waste valorization and how it plays a role in reducing food waste and offering a new source of food ingredients.\nThe Zero Waste Master Plan and the 30-by-30 Goal have been implemented by the Singapore government as important measures to tackle environmental sustainability and ensure food security. Singapore’s Zero Waste Master Plan is the nation’s inaugural strategy to achieve zero waste status [2]. The plan presents essential tactics for building a nation that is both sustainable and resource-efficient while also being resilient to climate change. A circular economy strategy is implemented for managing waste and resources, which helps to shift towards more sustainable methods of production and consumption. The Master Plan established ambitious waste reduction objectives for Singapore. As a target, the amount of waste sent to Singapore’s only landfill (Semakau) on a daily basis should be decreased by 30 percent by the year 2030. This objective will aid in prolonging the lifespan of this landfill beyond the year 2035.\nConsidering that the bulk of Singapore’s food is imported from other countries, it is crucial to prioritize local production in order to decrease reliance on food imports. The 30-by-30 key strategy aims at enhancing food security in Singapore. The objective of the 30-by-30 initiative is to enhance the capability and efficiency of the local agri-food sector in order to sustainably provide 30% of Singapore’s nutritional requirements by 2030 [3]. This objective is also embedded in the Singapore Green Plan 2030, which will actively contribute to fostering a more robust and sustainable food future. In order to accomplish this objective, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) has initiated a comprehensive strategy for the Lim Chu Kang area to enhance food production and expand sustainable fish farming in the deep southern waters of Singapore. This plan includes implementing various strategies, such as providing financial assistance for innovative research projects focused on creating sustainable food production systems.\nThis paper reviews food waste valorization in Singapore and the strategic move of incorporating the utilization of food waste into Singapore’s Zero Waste Plan and 30-by-30 objective. It facilitates the redirection of organic waste away from landfills, thus prolonging the operational duration of current waste disposal facilities and minimizing the impact on the environment. The act of upcycling food waste can result in the production of higher-value products to promote food sustainability. With all the inventive and financially beneficial sustainable technologies, the transformation of food waste into valuable resources serves as a catalyst for economic growth and fortifies Singapore’s standing in the global marketplace. The objectives of this paper are to highlight the food waste generated, disposed of and recycled in Singapore; to explore different applications, technologies and prototypes in food waste valorization, supported by local case studies from various food waste streams; to discuss the challenges associated with food waste valorization; and to review and evaluate Singapore government schemes and incentives in addressing the challenges identified. The content in this review includes food waste status in Singapore subsectioned into food wastage statistics, food waste recycling and food waste valorization; food waste valorization case studies in Singapore subsectioned into okara, spent barley grains and fruit and vegetable wastes; challenges in food waste valorization subsectioned into infrastructure development, economy viability, consumer awareness, collaborative partnership, regulatory support and data management; government schemes and incentives subsectioned into legislation and initiatives supporting food waste management.\nInternationally, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) proposed during the United Nations Conference set universal goals that help to address the urgent environmental, political and economic challenges [4]. The case studies on food waste valorization showcase actual examples where Singapore made efforts to achieve SDG 2: ‘Zero Hunger’; SDG 11: ‘Sustainable Cities and Communities’; and SDG 12: ‘Responsible Consumption and Production’, which are related to the concept of food waste valorization, helping to reduce waste and save landfill space. The environmental benefits derived from food waste valorization contribute to SDG 13: ‘Climate Action’.\n2. Food Waste Status in Singapore\n2.1. Food Wastage Statistics\nFood waste constitutes approximately 10% of the total waste stream in Singapore, making it a significant portion of the overall waste generated. In the year 2020, approximately 665 thousand tonnes of food waste were produced, with almost half of it coming from households [5]. Singapore has made the recycling of food waste a top priority in its sustainability efforts, as it acknowledges the need to reduce waste and move towards becoming a Zero Waste Nation.\nThe integration of food waste recycling aligns with Singapore’s overarching goal to improve food security and achieve self-sufficiency. To achieve the ambitious 30-by-30, it is crucial to investigate innovative methods of managing resources. This includes the utilization and integration of food waste into the food processing industry. Singapore’s practice of valuing food waste reduces waste and its negative effects on the environment, at the same time enhancing the durability and sustainability of its food supply chain.\nThe National Environment Agency (NEA) is currently undertaking the next phase of development for the Tuas Nexus Integrated Waste Management Facility (IWMF) in order to achieve these objectives [6]. This phase involves the construction of a modern Food Waste Treatment Facility (FWTF) that can process 400 tonnes per day of food waste, as well as an 800-tonnes-per-day Sludge Incineration Facility (SIF). Singapore’s infrastructural investments showcase its dedication to embracing state-of-the-art technologies and infrastructure to facilitate the sustainable handling of organic waste. This progress propels Singapore’s pursuit of a circular economy and a more resilient, self-sustaining future.\n2.2. Food Waste Recycling\nFigure 1 shows the food waste generated, disposed of and recycled in Singapore from 2018 to 2023 [5]. There is a fluctuation in the total amount of food waste generated over the years: from 763,000 tonnes in 2018, which dropped to 665,000 tonnes in 2020 and ended up with 755,000 tonnes in 2023. This trend suggests that despite efforts to reduce food waste, consumption patterns and population growth continue to drive up the overall amount of food waste produced in Singapore.\n\nFigure 1. Total food waste generated, disposed of and recycled in Singapore (2018–2023).\nThere has been some fluctuation in the amount of food waste disposed of and recycled: the recycling rate has remained relatively stable, hovering around 17% to 19% over the years. This indicates that while there have been efforts to increase food waste recycling, they are not sufficient to significantly impact the overall recycling rate.\nFurthermore, the amount of food waste recycled has shown a slight increase over the years, from 126,000 tonnes in 2018 to 132,000 tonnes in 2023. This suggests that there may be growing awareness and initiatives in place to encourage food waste recycling in Singapore. However, the recycling rate still remains relatively low compared to the total amount of food waste generated. Unrecycled food wastes are likely to end up in and compete for limited landfill space in Semakau Island, which is expected to be completely occupied by 2035 or even earlier [7].\nOverall, the data highlight the ongoing challenge of managing food waste in Singapore and the need for continued efforts to improve waste reduction, recycling and resource recovery initiatives. The key strategies for improving food waste management and achieving higher recycling rates will likely include the following: (a) Intensification of research on the valorization of food waste; (b) raising of public awareness; (c) implementation of effective policies; and (d) investment in infrastructure for the recycling of food waste.\n2.3. Food Waste Valorization\nFood waste valorization is the deliberate process of transforming leftover or excess food materials into valuable products that enhance and support the food supply chain (NEA, 2023) [8]. The processing flow encompasses treatment, bioreaction, extraction, purification, dehydration or concentration, and formulation. Treatment can be in the form of heat, chemical or mechanical, such as alkaline treatment and microwave-assisted ultrasonication. Enzymatic fermentation is a common bioreaction that utilizes the mechanism of the enzymatic pathway to break down a specific substrate in a controlled environment. Firstly, extraction can be done through treatments and bioreactions, and purification will follow up to ensure that the targeted compound is pure and isolated. Dehydration or concentration is usually carried out to maintain its original state and to prolong the shelf-life of the sample. Lastly, the dehydrated sample or powder can be utilized to formulate and innovate a food product. The efforts effectively cut greenhouse gas emissions, encouraging the conservation of resources while providing alternatives to food ingredients. Furthermore, they provide prospects for generating income and creating employment, contributing to economic durability and sustainability. By diverting food waste from landfills, the higher-value products obtained through the process of food waste valorization have a wide range of uses, each serving different parts of the food industry and meeting various societal requirements.\nSingapore’s strategy for managing food waste is multifaceted and forward-thinking. It serves as a comprehensive guide for policies and initiatives aimed at minimizing food waste generation. The key objectives are to promote sustainability and reduce the overall environmental impact of discarded food. Singapore places prevention at the forefront of its approach, emphasizing better inventory management, portion control, and awareness campaigns. When prevention is not feasible, the country focuses on converting food waste into valuable resources through methods like composting and anaerobic digestion. Edible surplus food is redirected to human and animal consumption, addressing both waste reduction and food insecurity. Landfill disposal is considered the least desirable option due to its environmental impact. The products can be classified into four primary categories: (a) animal nutrition; (b) food ingredients; (c) nutraceutical and functional foods; and (d) bioactive compounds from plants.\nThe use of food waste as a raw material for animal nutrition is a valuable method of enhancing its value. The treated waste can be converted into feed formulations that are appropriate for aquaculture and poultry, thus providing additional sources of feed and decreasing the environmental consequences linked to livestock farming [9]. This approach involves converting food waste into high-quality animal feeds, which reduces waste and improves resource efficiency in the agricultural sector.\nThe process of food waste valorization also enables the extraction and purification of valuable elements from discarded food materials, including proteins, fats, and natural colorings. The recovered components can be reincorporated into the food manufacturing cycle, functioning as eco-friendly substitutes for traditional sources. By utilizing these recovered resources, manufacturers can reduce their dependence on new materials, address vulnerabilities in their supply chain and foster circularity within the food industry [10].\nFood waste research has also focused on the extraction of bioactive compounds from food waste with the potential to provide health benefits, such as antioxidants, dietary fiber and prebiotics [11,12]. These extracts obtained from food sources that were previously not fully utilized or overlooked can be added to dietary supplements and pharmaceutical formulations. By harnessing the nutritional value of discarded food, besides improving human health and well-being, this method also stimulates innovation in discovering and formulating new nutraceuticals. Functional foods that contain beneficial bioactive components can also be developed from leftover or excess food materials [13]. These products are developed to provide targeted health benefits that go beyond basic nutrition in a normal dietary intake. They include a variety of formulations that are customized to meet the different preferences and dietary requirements of consumers. Manufacturers can address the increasing demand for healthier and more sustainable food choices, as well as reduce waste in the supply chain, by using functional ingredients derived from food waste.\nMultiple studies have shown that bioactive compounds obtained from food waste are effective in controlling pests, improving soil quality and increasing crop productivity [14,15]. Utilizing food waste to obtain bioactive compounds for agricultural use offers an environmentally friendly solution that is in line with sustainable resource management principles. By adopting the applications of these natural compounds, manufacturers and farmers not only decrease the negative impact of food waste on the environment but also decrease the dependence on synthetic chemicals in agriculture, which will encourage a more sustainable and eco-friendly farming method.\n3. Food Waste Valorization Case Studies in Singapore\nTable 1 is a summary of case studies conducted in Singapore from 2018 to 2024, focusing on the utilization of food waste for human consumption and agricultural applications. The selected studies are derived from a combination of scholarly journal publications and media reports.\nTable 1. Food waste valorization studies in Singapore (2018–2024).\n\n3.1. Okara\nOkara, a residual product of soybean processing, is one of the largest food waste streams in Singapore. Four studies involving okara valorization are identified and reviewed. Shan et. al. converted okara into a nutritious and sustainable alternative to dairy-based drinks using solid-state fermentation with a combination of microbial action and enzymatic reaction [17]. The final drink prototype contains live probiotics, which promote gut health, in addition to beneficial nutrients such as dietary fiber, free isoflavones and essential amino acids. The novel method tackles the issue of food waste while supporting Singapore’s wider sustainability objectives by decreasing dependence on conventional dairy production and advocating for the use of plant-based ingredients.\nRazali (2022) reported on the formulation of biscuits from okara undergoing solid-state fermentation, which increases the amino acid content of the biscuits [18]. The digestibility of okara after fermentation was enhanced by reducing the presence of anti-nutrients and releasing free amino acids. However, a postprandial blood amino acids study showed that the consumption of biscuits containing fermented okara does not alter postprandial amino acid responses in middle-aged and older Singaporeans. Incorporating fermented okara into biscuit manufacturing offers a chance to expand the market for plant-based snacks, appealing to health-conscious and environmentally conscious consumers who are looking for more sustainable options.\nIn addition to beverages and biscuits, a group of researchers from Republic Polytechnic, Singapore has solubilized okara and formulated it into three prototypes of soy cheese—soy cream cheese, soy cream soup and soy sliced cheese [19]. These soy cheese options have higher levels of protein, dietary fiber and antioxidants than their commercial dairy-based counterparts, providing consumers with a healthier and more environmentally friendly choice. The introduction of soy cream soup and sliced cheese made from okara-based ingredients showcases the adaptability of these ingredients in food innovation, appealing to a wide range of consumer tastes and dietary requirements. This initiative enhances the value of okara and further contributes to the expanding market for plant-based substitutes.\nA further processing on the solubilized okara by the research group has developed a novel okara-based plant biostimulant [20]. This biostimulant has been shown to promote leafy vegetables’ and melons’ growth as well as increasing their crop yield and quality. When administered to strawberry plants, it prevented and mitigated powdery mildew disease, concurrently enhancing flowering and fruiting processes. This novel method emphasizes the interdependence between the upcycling of food waste and the promotion of sustainable agriculture, highlighting the capacity of circular economy models to generate favorable environmental and economic results.\n3.2. Spent Barley Grain\nSpent barley grain (SBG) is another main food waste stream that is rich in fiber, protein and other valorizable nutrients. Barley grains are typically used in the beer-making process commonly known as malting. During malting, the grains are soaked, cooked to ferment, and then mashed to extract beer, which contains protein, sugar and nutrients from SBG [25]. After malting, SBG is the most abundant byproduct of the brewing process, accounting for 85% of the total brewing waste material produced [26]. In Singapore, there are more than 75,000 tons of SBG produced yearly, making it a sustainable food waste stream for valorization [27]. SBG has been transformed into protein and fiber-rich ingredients in the form of paste-like dough [21]. The ingredient was used to formulate starchless noodles with a minimal glycemic response in healthy individuals. The starchless noodles derived from spent barley grains exhibited comparable sensory characteristics as conventional starch-based noodles but with enhanced cohesiveness and chewiness. The noodle is a rich source of nutrients, including protein and dietary fibers.\nIn another study, protein was recovered from SBG using a solid-state fermentation by Rhizopus oligosporus [22]. The isolated fraction has a protein content ranging from 61% to 66%, with higher emulsifying abilities, foaming properties and water/oil binding capacities compared to the unfermented sample. The fermented SBG protein extract also exhibited greater antioxidative properties. In application, when used in a mayonnaise recipe, the extract exhibited superior emulsion stability in relation to creaming, microstructure and viscosity. The author concluded that fermented SBG protein has the potential to be used as a plant-based emulsifier in the fields of food, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.\n3.3. Fruit and Vegetable Wastes\nFruit and vegetables, despite being one of the most vulnerable foods to food spoilage, generally contain high amounts of dietary fiber, vitamins, minerals and bioactive compounds such as antioxidants. Their wastes from food processing trap the nutrients, making the wastes potentially valorizable. A group of students at local junior colleges and polytechnics in Singapore were engaged in valorizing kale and spinach wastes [23]. The vegetable waste samples were chilled, rinsed, chopped, boiled and pureed. The obtained purees were used to formulate the inks for three-dimensional food printing. They were tasked to innovate dishes based on these two wastes that looked good and were tasteful, which addressed consumers’ reluctance to embrace food waste as a valid food option. This approach tackles the issue of food waste, encourages advancements in food technology and provides new opportunities for sustainable food production and consumption methods.\nIn another study, orange peel waste was transformed into nutritious snacks using three-dimensional printing technology [24]. The researchers formulated rheology-modified inks derived from orange peels to print three-dimensional food products. It was also found that the orange peel waste contains bioflavonoids and demonstrates antioxidant activity. Thus, this study demonstrated a practical approach to repurposing food waste into valuable food products, thereby promoting food sustainability and circularity in food waste management through the utilization of 3D food printing as a technological tool.\nThese research and development initiatives to utilize food waste demonstrate the inventive nature and cooperative actions that are propelling Singapore’s shift towards a more sustainable and resilient food system. However, it is necessary to conduct additional research and evaluation to assess the long-term sustainability and socio-economic consequences of these initiatives. Obstacles such as the ability to handle increasing demands, gaining widespread approval from consumers, and establishing appropriate rules and regulations continue to be major challenges that need to be addressed.\n4. Challenges in Food Waste Valorization\nFigure 2 shows potential challenges in food waste valorization research and development that researchers and manufacturers commonly encounter in Singapore.\n\nFigure 2. Potential challenges in food waste valorization research and development.\nFood waste presents a substantial global challenge with negative consequences for environmental sustainability, economic effectiveness and social well-being. Efforts to capitalize on food waste have gained momentum as a result, with the goal of extracting value from resources that would otherwise be discarded. Nevertheless, many obstacles hinder the widespread acceptance and efficiency of food waste valorization initiatives. This section analyzes and tackles these challenges, suggesting strategies to overcome them and promote a more sustainable and efficient food system.\n4.1. Infrastructure Development\nThe establishment of a robust infrastructure for the treatment, bioreaction, extraction, purification, dehydration, concentration or formulation of food waste is necessary in order to facilitate the efficient valorization of food waste. There are many different types of food waste, and in order to accommodate them all, it is necessary to make significant investments in specialized facilities and equipment. The significant risk associated with investing in research without guaranteed returns hinders the advancement and acceptance of valorization technologies [28].\nSingapore has established a wide array of specialized facilities focused on the conversion of food waste into valuable resources. The NEA Tuas Nexus, managed by the National Environment Agency (NEA) and Singapore’s National Water Agency, is a prominent facility dedicated to the treatment of food waste using anaerobic digestion technology [29]. The plant processes 40 tonnes of wastewater sludge and food waste from 23 locations on a daily basis. The combination of wastewater sludge and food waste is subjected to anaerobic digestion, a biological process that decomposes organic substances without the presence of oxygen, in order to generate biogas for energy production. The findings revealed that the combined digestion of used water sludge and food waste leads to a significant boost in biogas production, with an increase of up to 40% compared to when the two inputs are digested separately.\nA Singapore-based company, ecoWise, engages in the investment, development and management of renewable energy projects that provide substantial environmental, social and economic advantages to the local community in which it operates [30]. The group is among the pioneering companies in Singapore that specialize in the development of biomass power plants. The group’s initial biomass co-generation power plant became fully operational in 2005. Subsequently, in 2011, a second biomass tri-generation power plant was commercially ready for operation under a public–private partnership contract with Gardens by the Bay—Singapore for a fifteen-year concession period. The company also operates a biomass co-generation power plant to produce electrical and thermal energy from food waste. Agricultural and food waste were dehydrated and repurposed as animal feed ingredients.\nAlthough Singapore has made substantial progress in the valorization of food waste, it is imperative to increase the capacity of current facilities or create new ones in order to handle the increasing amount of food waste. Enhancements are required in the collection and sorting mechanisms for food waste at its origin. Although Singapore has successfully enforced the compulsory segregation of food waste in specific areas, such as commercial and industrial establishments, ensuring widespread adherence in other sectors continues to be a difficult task. Improving the collecting infrastructure, such as implementing specialized vehicles and storage facilities for temporary storage, will simplify the logistics of managing food waste.\nIn order to overcome limitations in capacity, Singapore can contemplate the expansion of current anaerobic digestion facilities. This extension would enhance the overall processing capacity for food waste and enable more extensive waste diversion from landfills. Allocating resources to pilot projects focused on advanced technologies such as pyrolysis or hydrothermal processing has the potential to open up new opportunities for utilizing food waste. These technologies provide increased energy recovery efficiency and generate valuable byproducts such as biochar or biofuels, which can be utilized in diverse industrial applications or as sources of renewable energy [31].\nA major financial obstacle in developing food waste valorization infrastructure is the substantial upfront expenditure needed to construct and outfit facilities such as anaerobic digestion plants or composting facilities. These facilities frequently utilize intricate technology and infrastructure to effectively treat and manage organic waste.\nIn addition to the original capital costs, the operational charges and continuing maintenance provide considerable financial obstacles. These expenditures encompass expenses related to garbage collection, processing, energy generation and adherence to environmental rules.\nObtaining scientific evidence to support initiatives that aim to make use of food waste often requires expensive research, which can be a major obstacle for food manufacturers. Therefore, ongoing research and development are crucial for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of food waste valorization processes at lab-based and pilot-scale production levels before the processes are upscaled to mass production. Some manufacturers may opt to engage Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) or contract manufacturers in the process of developing and implementing valorization technologies, which can expedite the pace of mass production by reducing the risk of installing huge infrastructure that involves a huge direct investment [32]. Facilitating collaborations between government institutions, such as the NEA in Singapore, and private investors can harness the assistance and knowledge of the public sector along with the funding capabilities of the private sector. Public–private partnerships (PPPs) have the ability to distribute risks, reduce the costs of financing, and expedite the establishment and growth of infrastructure for the valorization of food waste.\n4.2. Economic Viability\nTo secure long-term investments and ensure sustainability, it is critically important to determine if the transformation of waste into valuable commodities is economically feasible. It is necessary to identify the specific volumes of food waste that are critical in order to achieve economies of scale and effectively manage logistics costs [33]. In Singapore, at least 30 tonnes of okara and 55 tonnes of spent barley grains are generated daily [34]. These are the two food processing side streams that are commonly upcycled, as both have a more sustainable local supply, which allows for a scalable approach once the valorization method is established.\nThe incorporation of food waste valorization into supply chains is encouraged by the adoption of a model consistent with a circular economy. The implementation of a closed-loop system and the repurposing of waste resources are two ways in which the industry can reduce its reliance on new materials and improve its production sustainability. By evaluating the economic viability of various valorization techniques and exploring market potential, stakeholders can make informed decisions that promote both environmental stewardship and financial prosperity. Exploring the market potential for products derived from food waste valorization is essential to attract investment and foster economic growth in this sector. Singapore provides a unique case where innovative solutions have successfully captured market demand. For instance, bioethanol production from food waste has gained traction due to favorable government policies supporting renewable energy initiatives. Similarly, biochemicals derived from food waste have found niche markets in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, leveraging Singapore’s strategic location as a hub for biotechnology and chemical industries [35].\n4.3. Consumer Awareness\nConsumer awareness refers to the level of knowledge and understanding that individuals have about their rights and responsibilities as consumers [36]. It involves being informed about product quality, safety, pricing and the various laws and regulations.\nIt is crucial to make deliberate attempts to inform consumers about novel functional ingredients and products that are made from food waste in order to promote their acceptance and usage. According to Hellali et al. (2023), the demand for circular food products is lower compared to their conventional counterparts [37]. Individuals who are averse to taking risks are willing to pay a lower price for these products compared to individuals who are more inclined to take risks. Positive information presented within an environmental or health framework has a more significant impact on the willingness to pay for upcycled foods compared to information focused on the economy.\nTherefore, disseminating information to the general public, including the use of social media, regarding the significance of reducing and utilizing food waste promotes modifications in behavior towards conscientious consumption and waste control [38]. Community involvement and engagement campaigns are crucial in promoting awareness to create a consumer market that is friendly to food waste valorization. Having this in place is especially important in order to complete a supply chain loop.\nConsumer awareness is crucial in promoting food waste valorization efforts in Singapore. Consumer engagement that is effective can have a substantial impact on how the public perceives and behaves towards using items made from food waste.\nZero Waste SG, a not-for-profit and non-governmental organization in Singapore, has implemented the Save Food Cut Waste campaign to address the issue of food loss [39]. This project focuses on decreasing wastage at all stages of the supply chain, with a particular emphasis on raising consumer awareness. The program utilizes various forms of media, community activities, and partnerships with food outlets to educate customers on the significance of reducing food waste.\n4.4. Collaborative Partnerships\nThe key to success in converting food waste into valuable resources lies in a collaborative framework that unites various stakeholders. Research institutions are crucial in this ecosystem, as they utilize scientific expertise to create cutting-edge technologies and solutions. In Singapore, research institutions, including the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), universities and polytechnics, are at the forefront of innovative research in food waste valorization technologies. These institutions are investigating various methods, including advanced biotechnological processes and innovative product development, to optimize the upcycling of food waste.\nHowever, cross-collaboration between institutions and industry can be enhanced to share resources and propel innovations. The networking initiatives supported by the European Union can be a reference for Singapore to facilitate joint research on the valorization of food waste and enhance the transfer of knowledge between different stakeholders [40]. Organized communication channels among research institutions, industrial partners, and government bodies can be formed to improve transparency and promote the flow of knowledge. It is critical that the private sector recognizes the importance of addressing environmental concerns as well as the economic opportunities associated with converting waste into valuable resources. Incubators and accelerators are essential in fostering the growth of startups and small–medium companies engaged in the process of converting food waste into valuable products. Resources such as mentorship, access to funding and business development support can assist in transforming research breakthroughs into commercially viable solutions.\nA key aspect of Singapore’s strategy for food waste management is actively involving the community. Singaporeans are encouraged to minimize waste generation, separate food waste for recycling and embrace sustainable consumption practices through public education campaigns, grassroots initiatives and community-led projects.\nSchools, community centers and non-profit organizations actively contribute to raising awareness and fostering behavior change [41]. Composting workshops, urban farming projects, and food rescue programs are empowering individuals to actively participate in reducing food waste and promoting a more sustainable future. Regular meetings, workshops and webinars can be conducted on platforms to encourage conversations on research goals, technical difficulties and market demands.\n4.5. Regulatory Support\nIt is of utmost importance to ensure the safety and quality of food products derived from waste. The safety and quality standardization of food waste for food applications refers to the process of transforming food waste into products that can be safely consumed by humans or used for other valuable purposes [42]. Regulatory authorities must establish precise standards and guidelines for the processing of food waste to ensure the production of safe and top-notch products. This encompasses factors such as hygiene protocols, measures to prevent contamination and the composition of the product. Standardization endeavors may encompass the establishment of thresholds for impurities, the implementation of processing methodologies and the enforcement of adherence to food safety management systems such as Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP).\nThe utilization of food waste can be hindered by regulatory obstacles such as limitations on health claims and labeling for food products derived from food waste when safety and toxicity are concerned [43]. This entails providing scientific evidence to support claims and establishing consumer comprehension and confidence. Well-defined criteria aid in distinguishing products in the market according to their health advantages, promoting consumer trust and enabling well-informed decisions.\nRegulatory frameworks can have a significant impact on motivating businesses and individuals to embrace practices that reduce and make use of food waste. The Singaporean government plays a pivotal role in promoting the valorization of food waste by implementing policy interventions and regulatory frameworks. The National Environment Agency (NEA) works together with industry stakeholders to develop guidelines for waste management practices and encourage the use of sustainable technologies through incentives. Regulations and policies that are advantageous, such as tax incentives and waste diversion targets, can motivate businesses and individuals to embrace waste reduction and valorization practices [44].\nIn order to optimize the utilization of food waste in Singapore, it is possible to introduce targeted regulatory enhancements that will promote innovation, guarantee product safety and stimulate the expansion of the sector. Clear and specific standards and rules for the processing of food waste can be established to ensure the production of safe goods. This encompasses rules for maintaining cleanliness, measures to prevent contamination and criteria for the composition of products. Precise criteria for pollutants and impurities in food waste-derived goods can be established to guarantee their safety and quality. The standards imposed by the European Union on the recycling of organic waste into compost or biogas have stringent thresholds for pollutants and pathogens to guarantee the safety of the end products. These regulations establish a precise structure for managing organic waste while upholding stringent safety criteria.\nIt is important to demand empirical proof to validate health claims for food products produced from food waste. This guarantees that any asserted health advantages are supported by reputable scientific studies. Labeling regulations should be established that provide customers with clear and comprehensive information regarding the source of substances (e.g., “derived from food waste”) and their safety advantages. Additionally, standards should be developed to authenticate and validate products derived from food waste, fostering customer confidence and enabling well-informed choices.\n4.6. Data Management\nThe UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs advocates for the strategic utilization of big data to mitigate food loss and waste and foster sustainable growth [45]. By harnessing advanced data analytics techniques across the entire food supply chain, stakeholders can gain profound insights into patterns, inefficiencies and opportunities for improvement. This data-driven approach enables stakeholders to predict demand with greater accuracy, optimize inventory management and enhance logistical operations. Additionally, big data facilitates the identification of critical points where food loss occurs, allowing for targeted interventions to minimize waste. These interventions may include implementing innovative storage solutions, improving transportation logistics and optimizing distribution networks. Moreover, big data empowers stakeholders to track and trace food products more effectively, ensuring timely delivery and reducing the likelihood of spoilage [46]. Overall, leveraging big data in the fight against food loss and waste not only promotes environmental sustainability but also contributes to economic resilience by optimizing resource allocation and enhancing productivity in the food sector.\nA similar big data model can be adopted for food waste valorization. Robust data collection and monitoring systems are crucial for effectively tracking progress and optimizing valorization processes. The process of digitalization can improve the effectiveness and precision of data management, thereby enabling well-informed decision-making in valorizing food waste [47]. A sustainable supply of food waste is crucial for long-term production operations using food waste as raw materials. Comprehensive data collection and monitoring systems on food waste produced from different sources help to identify a supply of raw materials for valorization, allowing more precise predictions on the volume of production.\n5. Government Schemes and Incentives\n5.1. Legislation\nFood waste presents a substantial global challenge, impacting both the sustainability of the environment and the efficiency of the economy. The Singaporean government has made addressing food waste a priority due to the scarcity of land and resources in the country. In 2014, the NEA introduced the Mandatory Waste Reporting scheme to cover hotels and malls and extend it to industrial premises and convention and exhibition centers in 2010. Based on the findings, between 2021 and 2022, the recycling rate only increased for large hotels (8.6 to 10.5%) and decreased for large malls and industrial premises (12.6% to 11.6% and 55.1% to 54.4%, respectively) [48].\nThe Resource Sustainability Act (RSA) 2019 and Resource Sustainability (Amendment) Act 2023 aim to establish a structure to manage the inevitable food waste produced by large establishments. Since 2021, it has been mandatory for developers of new industrial and commercial developments generating large amounts of food waste to set aside space for on-site food waste treatment in their factory layout plans, as Singapore will move to closed-loop management of food waste in 2024. From this year onward, the National Environmental Agency (NEA) requires owners and operators of establishments such as hotels, malls and large industrial developments to separate food waste for processing [49]. The occupier of the prescribed building will be liable to a fine should they dispose of food in a non-designated facility. In addition, the building manager will be liable to a fine or imprisonment should the prescribed does not enable the occupier to dispose of food waste separately from other types of waste. Finally, the RSA mandates that all food waste disposed of in the designated facility must be treated in the building; the building manager will also be accountable by a fine or imprisonment.\nThe scope of legislation primarily focuses on waste management, and this does not sufficiently address upstream factors, which are overproduction, supply chain efficiencies and consumer behavior. Additionally, though the legislation targets large commercial and industrial food waste generators, there should be more effort to reach out to small-scale industries and run more public awareness campaigns and educational programs on household food waste, encouraging efficient food purchase and good preparation habits to save money and reduce food wastage.\nCompliance and accurate reporting are crucial for policymaking, but ensuring consistency and reliable data collection on food waste generation from different sources will be an ongoing challenge. The government can gradually implement mandatory food waste reporting in large-scale food industries before moving into medium- and small-scale businesses. Stringent enforcement of penalties can drive effective legislation but also may not be practical across all sectors. Therefore, to foster compliance, the legislation should be flexible to recognize the diversity of the food industry and be accommodating to different business sizes and types.\nThe installation and maintenance of on-site food waste segregation systems and treatment facilities can incur significant expenses. The large size of such equipment may pose challenges for small- or medium-sized establishments in terms of space constraints [50]. The space that could have been utilized for generating revenue has now transformed into a cost center for these companies. Operational disruptions may occur in the collection of food waste in manufacturing companies, requiring staff training. In addition to providing training, it is necessary to establish a new mindset that promotes the adoption of new operating procedures. This will require the company to allocate additional time and resources. To encourage smooth adoption to upcycle, recycle and reduce waste, NEA launched the 3R Fund, where they co-fund up to 80 percent of organizations’ qualifying costs, capped at $1 million per project or per applicant [51].\nFood contamination concerns have led companies to implement stringent regulations regarding food safety and quality. Consequently, it is essential to provide training to the staff to ensure that they can hygienically handle food waste, particularly when the food waste is intended to be used as a source of food for human consumption. The implementation, optimization and maintenance of treatment systems may necessitate specialized technical knowledge. Smaller establishments may lack the internal capability or be unaware of where to locate such resources.\nAdmittedly, it is challenging to address all these gaps, as it involves collaboration between the trinity, government agencies, businesses and the public. Continuous monitoring and adaptation with some flexibility to the legislation is necessary to ensure an impactful outcome.\n5.2. Initiatives Supporting Food Waste Management\nThe Singapore government has designated a $1.76 million SGD Food Waste Fund to subsidize the expenses of food waste treatment solutions. The objective of this fund is to encourage organizations to implement efficient waste management strategies. The Food Resource Valorisation Awards were launched by the National Environment Agency (NEA) in 2021 with the aim of promoting active engagement from organizations. Three local companies were honored with the merit award for their innovative methods of utilizing food waste [52].\nThe NEA, together with IPI, Enterprise Singapore, co-organized the annual Sustainability Open Innovation Challenge (SOIC) in 2021, inviting innovative ideas for the collaborative development of sustainable solutions [53] to establish resilient on-site food waste treatment systems that efficiently utilize limited space while producing valuable outputs [54]. A total of 16 corporates participated and submitted their challenge statements; 627 proposals were received, and 15 startups were awarded [55]. The startups were given the opportunity to discuss the development of the solutions. This initiative provides a maximum of $2 million SGD to enhance the separation of food waste into different categories, including both uniform and non-uniform waste.\nAnother new initiative, The Hungry for Change Challenge, was launched in 2022 by the NEA and the Development Bank of Singapore (DBS) Foundation in collaboration. This challenge enables individuals to take control and lead efforts to implement solutions that are specifically designed to decrease or stop the occurrence of food waste in Singapore. Five startups in Singapore —Mottainai Food Tech, tHEMEat Company, ChangeX, Divert for 2nd Life and The Moonbeam Co—were awarded a total of $125,000 to develop their solutions. Through promoting collaboration and stimulating creative ideas, these startups developed new food varieties, such as plant-based meats and spent coffee-ground cookies, providing many success stories to consumers [56].\nThe NEA and the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) collaborated extensively with the food industry to create resources, training programs and guidelines for optimal performance. Food manufacturers can consult the freely available online guidebook on food waste minimization prepared by the SFA as a reference. Establishments in Singapore benefit from collaborating with various startups to effectively navigate different technologies for treating food waste [57].\nIt is crucial to increase public consciousness regarding food waste management. The third ‘Say YES to Waste Less’ campaign was launched by the NEA in September 2021 [58]. The campaign advocates a sustainable lifestyle by purchasing an optimal quantity of food to reduce food wastage, reducing the use of disposable waste by deploying reusable containers to minimize packaging waste and businesses collaborating with the NEA to support this campaign. More than 140 companies supported this campaign through the collection of surplus food, the diversion of foods that are near ‘best-before’ dates, the reduction of single-use waste through a closed-loop reusable system and the upcycling of food side streams back into food production. A social enterprise, through the smart use of its propriety AI technology, has diverted more than 600 tonnes of surplus food, helped partners save $7.1 million and prevented 3114 tonnes of carbon emissions [59].\nThe Singapore government’s extensive range of support initiatives, encompassing financial assistance and the promotion of innovation, aim to facilitate a seamless and economical transition, particularly for smaller enterprises. SOIC is now in its fifth edition, while DBS X Hungry for Change returns for the second time with more partners joining the initiative. The multiple runs from these events are testimonies to the importance of sustainability and food waste valorization in Singapore.\nTo reinforce existing initiatives, the NEA can consider strengthening the Food Valorisation Award by having additional award categories, such as Most Innovative Solution or Most Scalable Solution, and developing a comprehensive and standardized index to measure food loss and waste across food supply chains with the data collected.\nThe government can tap into food waste management knowledge from countries to learn from their best practices and about the ecosystem these countries have developed for South Korea and China.\nSouth Korea developed a ‘Food Waste Reduction Masterplan’ in 1996 for food establishments and households. They established a recycling program in 1998 and banned food waste from landfills by 2005. In 2010, the South Korean government introduced a volume-based food waste fee system (pay-as-you-throw model), where residents purchase biodegradable bags to dispose of food waste and pay based on the weight of disposed waste. Strict enforcement with penalties is imposed for non-compliance, and this has significantly reduced Seoul’s household food waste by nearly 47,000 tonnes in six years (2013 to 2019) and has increased food waste recycling from less than 2% in 1995 to 95% in 2019 [60]. Stringent measures have proven to be an effective method, and the Singapore government should consider these as they move to tackle the challenge of increasing involvement in managing food waste among Singapore residents [61].\nChina’s anti-food waste law was implemented in 2021 as a need to address the challenges they face in food security for domestic food supply. The COVID pandemic, serious floods since 1998 and increasing agricultural imports in 2020 have triggered the government of the People’s Republic of China to address food security and food waste reduction. The anti-food waste law targets mainly catering service providers and food producers, as these places generate the most food waste. This policy was adopted with sanctioning power due to non-compliance and negative consequences when there were no sanctions for the past 9 years. The approach was to motivate a change in cultural practices, such as ‘face saving’, where diners are less likely to pack their leftovers after a meal in a restaurant setting [62]. The government continues to lead changes through bottom-up actions by getting multiple parties such as commercial, social, the general public and the government themselves to establish the ‘big food concept’ of promoting food diversity on both ends—agricultural production and consumers—to change consumers’ consumption patterns to buy only what they can finish and eat more white meat to save animal feed, and to protect the environment while meeting the nation’s protein demand [63]. Various initiatives and systems to collect data directly from caterers and food producers have been implemented nationwide and will be consolidated.\nCase studies have shown that for a food system to be sustainable and secure, the government, businesses, research institutions and individuals will have to contribute, either with a top-down or bottom-up approach. To ensure its longevity for future generations, a combination of a top-down approach to adhering to rules and regulations and a bottom-up approach to actively influencing and changing consumers’ behavior is needed to reduce waste to the greatest extent possible.\n6. Conclusions\nThe Zero Waste Plan offers a strategic structure for minimizing the creation of waste and maximizing the efficiency of resources, with a focus on reducing waste, recycling and implementing circular economy principles. Integrating food waste valorization strategies perfectly fits with this vision, providing opportunities to redirect food waste away from landfills, decrease greenhouse gas emissions and generate new food sources and resources that can enhance food production, such as urban farming in the country.\nThis review has indicated that although there have been attempts to enhance food waste recycling, they are inadequate to substantially influence the total recycling rate. Various methods, technologies, and prototypes used to convert food waste into valuable resources are highlighted. Case studies of different food waste streams in Singapore are reviewed, showing promising research and industry applications. Additionally, challenges in infrastructure development, economic viability, consumer awareness, collaborative partnerships, regulatory support and data management that are associated with food waste valorization are discussed. Government schemes and incentives related to food waste management, focusing on legislation and initiatives, are explained.\nFood waste valorization is an excellent initiative that fits well with Singapore’s 30-by-30 goal, which highlights the importance of improving food security by focusing on local production and innovation. By implementing a food waste valorization process, environmental concerns can be effectively addressed while simultaneously bolstering the food system’s resilience and self-sufficiency. Incorporating the utilization of food waste into Singapore’s Zero Waste Plan and 30-by-30 goal offers a comprehensive solution to urgent environmental and economic issues. Singapore can convert its food waste into valuable resources and make progress towards its sustainability goals by utilizing advanced technologies and promoting partnerships between the government, research institutions, industry and communities.\nHarnessing this potential necessitates collective endeavors to surmount the numerous challenges delineated in this paper. Stakeholders in Singapore can fully realize the advantages of food waste valorization and contribute to a more sustainable future by giving priority to infrastructure development, economic viability, consumer awareness, collaborative partnerships, regulatory compliance and data management. For policymakers, clearer and more comprehensive guidelines and standards for food waste valorization should be developed to better support more extensive food waste management in Singapore.\nUltimately, Singapore can effectively address environmental concerns, capitalize on economic prospects and enhance food security resilience by prioritizing the utilization of food waste. Future research can focus on exploring innovative technologies for scalable food waste valorization and improving data collection and management practices. By employing strategic planning, innovation and collective action from research institutions, industry players, government and communities, Singapore has the potential to lead the way towards a future that is both sustainable and resilient for future generations.\nAuthor Contributions\nWriting—original draft, K.H., K.T., A.C. and C.C.C.L.; Writing—review & editing, K.H., K.T., A.C. and C.C.C.L.

These additions were made following feedback from MSE’s stakeholders and members of public after the publication of the inaugural report in 2023.\n3 The GreenGov.SG report is released annually to provide a snapshot of the public sector’s performance on greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, water use, and waste disposed. It covers the public sector’s assets in Singapore, including office buildings, healthcare facilities, schools, public utilities installations, public transport infrastructure, and vehicles. The report also sets out the public sector’s key strategies and initiatives to enhance environmental sustainability.\n4 GreenGov.SG was introduced in 2021 as a key enabler of the Singapore Green Plan 2030. Under GreenGov.SG, the public sector has set targets to achieve net zero emissions around 2045, five years ahead of Singapore’s national target of net zero by 2050. The public sector has also committed to reducing energy and water use by 10%, and waste disposed of by 30% respectively in 2030. Measures are in place to green buildings, reduce waste, and increase solar energy adoption to meet these targets.\n5 The public sector’s emissions and resource usage comprises those from our general offices, specialised infrastructure and facilities that deliver services to the general public. As the Government expands its public services, including to meet the needs of an ageing population and growing economy, additional public infrastructure will be required and developed. As the emissions and resource usage of large infrastructure tends to be lumpy, upticks can be expected whenever new facilities are put into operations, thereby impacting the overall trajectory of the public sector’s emissions and resource usage.\nReport Findings\n6 FY2023 saw gradual recovery in economic activities following the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, as lives for Singaporeans returned to normalcy, demand for public sector services returned close to pre-pandemic levels.\nCarbon Emissions\n7 In FY2023, the public sector emitted around 3.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, a 0.2% decrease from FY2022. This was driven by an overall decrease in Scope 1 emissions from the Tuas South Waste-to-Energy Plant, offsetting the increase in diesel consumption as bus service mileage increased from improved bus frequencies and coverage.\n8 Scope 2 emissions increased by 0.3% from FY2022 largely due to a full year of operation of the Stage 3 of the Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL) and newly-opened healthcare facilities such as Tan Tock Seng Hospital Integrated Care Hub and Woodlands Health. The public sector’s FY2023 emissions remain about 6.8% lower than the FY2020 baseline.\nEnergy Utilisation and Water Efficiency Index\n9 The public sector’s total electricity use in FY2023 was 5,449 GWh, which was a 1.5% increase from FY2022 and 1.0% increase from the average FY2018-FY2020 baseline. The public sector’s electricity used per unit area, or Energy Utilisation Index (EUI), in FY2023 was 112.6 kWh/m2, which was a 1.0% increase from FY2022 due to increased electricity use across public sector premises. The EUI in FY2023 was 3.7% lower than the FY2018-FY2020 baseline, due to new facilities being designed to higher energy efficiency standards and retrofitting of older ones with more energy efficient systems.\n10 The public sector’s water use in FY2023 was 33.4 billion litres, which was a 0.4% decrease from FY2022, and a 1.4% decrease from the FY2018-FY2020 baseline. The public sector’s water used per person per day, or Water Efficiency Index (WEI), in FY2023 was 60.7 litres/person/day, which was a 4.0% decrease from FY2022 and a 5.6% decrease from the FY2018-FY2020 baseline. This was due to improvements to water management at public sector premises with greater adoption of water-efficient measures and processes, which is reflected in more public buildings achieving PUB’s Water Efficient Building (Basic) certification.\nWaste Data\n11 The public sector’s waste disposed of in FY2023 was 218.7 million kilograms, which was a 1.3% increase from FY2022, due to increased levels of activity and higher footfall at public sector facilities post-COVID. The public sector’s waste disposed of per person per day in FY2023 was 0.380 kilograms per person per day, which was a 9.1% decrease from the FY2022 baseline. The decrease was driven by collective efforts to reduce waste across public sector premises. Key strategies highlighted in the report include minimising the use of single-use disposables, reusing old materials and finding creative ways to expand their lifespan and by recycling of various waste streams – food, plastic and e-waste.\nGreenGov.SG Reporting a Continuous Work in Progress\n12 The public sector is committed to continuous learning and improvement in our reporting journey. In this vein, MSE has also shared some of the challenges faced in implementing the public sector’s sustainability initiatives, as well as its experiences, which it hopes are useful to organisations and groups looking to implement sustainability strategies.\n13 Government Chief Sustainability Officer, who oversees the GreenGov.SG movement, Mr Lim Tuang Liang, said, “We are appreciative of those who have provided us with feedback following the publication of our inaugural GreenGov.SG report last year. We have considered and incorporated these suggestions where possible in this year’s report. We will continue to learn from others and refine our reporting, as sustainability reporting is a continuous journey of improvement. Through the features of various sustainability initiatives in our report, we have also shared some of our learning points and hope these are useful for businesses and organisations on their sustainability journey.”\n14 The full FY2023 GreenGov.SG report is available here.\n15 To complement the GreenGov.SG report, Statutory Boards will publish annual environmental sustainability disclosures, starting in FY2024. These disclosures will provide detail on how Statutory Boards are doing their part to advance environmental sustainability.

Waste generated by the non-domestic and domestic sectors were 4.97 million tonnes and 1.89 million tonnes respectively in 2023.\nThe overall recycling rate decreased from 57 per cent in 2022 to 52 per cent in 2023. The domestic recycling rate remained stable at 12 per cent and the non-domestic recycling rate decreased to 67 per cent from 72 per cent in 2022. [...] The overall recycling rate decreased from 57 per cent in 2022 to 52 per cent in 2023, largely due to the amount of construction and demolition (C&D) waste, which is almost completely recycled, dropping significantly last year. Excluding C&D waste, the overall recycling rate in 2023 was 45 per cent, which is comparable to 2022’s rate at 46 per cent.

This indicates that households and companies have taken positive steps to reduce and reuse.\n**Per capita and per GDP waste generated decreased in past decade  \n**The daily domestic waste generated per capita decreased from 1.08 kg in 2013 to 0.88 kg in 2023.\n\nFig. 1. A chart on the daily domestic waste generated per capita from 2013 to 2023.\nThe daily non-domestic waste generated per dollar GDP decreased from 40 tonnes in 2013 to 26 tonnes in 2023.\n\nFig. 2. A chart on the daily non-domestic waste generated per dollar GDP from 2013 to 2023.\nRecycling rate declined due to structural factors\nThere was a decline in the overall recycling rate over the past decade, especially for paper and cardboard. Paper recycling dropped from over 50 per cent a decade ago to 31 per cent in 2023. This is largely due to structural factors such as freight costs and commodity prices.\nThe overall recycling rate decreased from 57 per cent in 2022 to 52 per cent in 2023, largely due to the amount of construction and demolition (C&D) waste, which is almost completely recycled, dropping significantly last year. Excluding C&D waste, the overall recycling rate in 2023 was 45 per cent, which is comparable to 2022’s rate at 46 per cent.\n\nFig. 3. A chart on the total waste generated from 2013 to 2023.\n\nFig. 4. A chart on the overall recycling rate from 2013 to 2023.\nRedoubling efforts to improve recycling and resource recovery\nNEA promotes the 3Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle) in working towards the goal of a Zero Waste Nation. As part of the Singapore Green Plan and Zero Waste Masterplan, we developed a suite of initiatives to shift attitudes and behaviours to make the 3Rs the norm for citizens and businesses. NEA also continues to study and develop new ways to close the various resource loops. This includes exploring the use of mixed materials from Semakau Landfill, which comprise incineration ashes and other waste materials, as reclamation fill.\nHousehold recycling participation has been on an uptrend. According to NEA’s 2023 survey on household recycling [3], 72 per cent of households recycle compared to 64 per cent in 2021. In addition, a higher proportion of survey respondents are aware of common items that can be deposited into the recycling bins and chutes. NEA recognises that individual efforts to conserve our resources are vital, and encourages households to not just recycle more, but also to recycle right.\nThere is a greater urgency for each of us to build a sustainability culture where we reduce, reuse, and recycle. By reducing waste and recycling right, we can do our part to combat climate change and ensure that Singapore remains clean, green, and liveable.\n\n[1] Domestic waste is waste collected from households and trade premises (e.g., shophouses, educational institutions, petrol stations, hawker centres and places of worship).\n[2] Non-domestic waste is waste generated at industrial and commercial premises.\n[3] https://www.nea.gov.sg/media/news/news/index/72-per-cent-of-households-recycle-in-2023\nANNEX A\n2013 to 2023 Overall Waste and Recycling Statistics\n(with and without Construction and Demolition waste)\n\nThe overall recycling rate decreased from 57 per cent in 2022 to 52 per cent in 2023 largely due to the amount of Construction and Demolition (C&D) waste, which is almost completely recycled, dropping significantly last year. Excluding C&D waste, the overall recycling rate in 2023 was 45 per cent, which is comparable to 2022’s rate at 46 per cent.\nC&D waste decreased by more than 40 per cent in 2023, compared to 2022, because there were fewer demolition projects. Such waste is a key industrial waste stream that is generated in large amounts. Hence, sharp Year-on-Year swings in the amount of such waste would result in huge fluctuations to the non-domestic and overall recycling rates. Excluding such waste, the overall recycling rate declined from 51 per cent to 45 per cent over the last decade.\nYear     Waste Generated('000 tonnes)Waste Recycled('000 tonnes)Waste Disposed('000 tonnes)Overall Recycling RateOverallRecycling Rate w/oC&D waste20137,8514,8263,02662%51%20147,5154,4713,04360%51%20157,6734,6503,02461%52%20167,8144,7693,04561%51%20177,7044,7242,98061%51%20187,7594,7902,96962%52%20197,2784,2932,98459%49%20205,8803,0402,84152%44%20216,9443,8263,11855%47%20227,3854,1883,19757%46%20236,8593,5533,30652%45%\nANNEX B\n2023 Overall Waste and Recycling Statistics\n\nIn 2023, about 6.86 million tonnes of solid waste were generated, of which 3.55 million tonnes were recycled.

Food waste may also contaminate other recyclables in the blue recycling bins and end up compromising the recycling outcomes (dirty recyclables are usually of little value to recycle). Therefore, there is a need to manage food waste holistically. Reducing food wastage, redistributing unsold or excess food, and valorising/treating food waste are important components of our national waste management strategies to work towards Singapore becoming a Zero Waste Nation. The diagram below shows Singapore’s food waste management hierarchy that prioritises the prevention of food waste from being generated.\nFood waste management hierarchy\n**Resource Sustainability Act (RSA)  \n**The Resource Sustainability Act (RSA) was enacted in 2019 to give legislative effect to new measures to address the priority waste streams (including food waste). The RSA is available here and the Resource Sustainability (Food Waste Segregation, Treatment And Reporting) Regulations 2024 is available here.\nUnder the RSA, affected buildings will be required to segregate their food waste for treatment and reporting. These are industrial and commercial buildings that generate large amounts of food waste. The types of buildings and their thresholds are stated in Table 1.\nTable 1: Buildings covered under the food waste segregation and reporting framework\nTypes of Buildings\nThreshold\nCommercial  \nShopping Malls \nF&B Area*\n> 3,000 sqm\nHotels\nF&B and Function Area\n> 3,000 sqm\nIndustrial#\nSingle-user Factory\n(SUFs)\nLarge Food Manufacturers^\nOperation area > 750 sqm\nMulti-user Factory (MUFs)\nGFA and food tenants\nGFA > 20,000 sqm and with > 20 food tenants\nAt least one large food manufacturer^\nOperation area > 750 sqm  \nNote:\n*Gross Floor Area set aside for supermarkets located in shopping malls will count towards the computation of F&B area of said shopping malls.  \nExclude the following specified activities: (i) manufacturing any food addictive, dried food or spices; (ii) manufacturing bottled drinking water; (iii) high pressure processing of food.\n^ As licensed under Singapore Food Agency’s Licence to operate a food processing establishment.\nThe RSA requirements are summarised below:  \nStakeholder\nRequirements\nOccupier (e.g., tenants)\nSegregate and dispose of food waste at the facility provided by the owner/building manager.  \n(If managing their own food waste) Obtain approval from NEA to do so and share data with owner/building manager for reporting.\nOwners/ building managers\nProvide a designated facility within the building to allow tenants to dispose of food waste separately from other waste.  \nOwners/building managers of new buildings must treat all segregated food waste on-site unless prior written permission has been obtained from NEA to treat the segregated food waste outside the premises.  \nOwners/building managers of existing buildings must either treat the food waste on-site, or engage a licensed waste collector to send the food waste for treatment at an off-site facility.  \nReport amount of segregated food waste that is treated annually.\nSince 1 January 2021, developers of new buildings must allocate space for on-site food waste treatment systems in their design plans.\nThe food waste segregation, treatment and reporting requirements for new buildings has commenced on 8 March 2024. For existing buildings, the requirements will commence progressively, in tandem with the phased completion of the food waste treatment facility at Tuas Nexus.\nPlease visit the sub-pages below for further information on our strategic approaches:\n\nStrategy 1: Prevent and Reduce Food Wastage at Source\nStrategy 2: Redistribute Unsold/Excess Food\nStrategy 3: Valorise/Treat Food Waste\nStrategy 4: Recover Energy\n\n(Updated as at April 2025)\n\nBack toTop\nOur Related Sites\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNational Environment Agency\nGet the app\n\nDownload for Android\nDownload for iPhone\n\nBest viewed using the current and previous release of Chrome and Safari\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nFeedback\n\n\nFollow us\n\nFacebook\nInstagram\nLinkedIn\nWhatsApp\nTelegram\nTiktok\nThreads\nYoutube\nTiktok\nRSS\n\n\n\nReport Vulnerability\n\nPrivacy Statement\nTerms of Use\nOpen Data Licence\nSitemap\nREACH\n\n© 2025 Government of Singapore\nLast updated 16 April 2025\nHow can I help?\n\n\nAsk Captain Green\nRate chat\nDownload Transcript\nPowered by GovTech\n Share\n Share\n Tweet\n Share\n Share\n\n\nWE CARE ABOUT YOUR PRIVACY\nManage Settings\nVendors\nVendor Settings\nPurposes\nVendors can:\nStore and/or access information on a device\nUse limited data to select advertising\nCreate profiles for personalised advertising\nUse profiles to select personalised advertising\nCreate profiles to personalise content\nUse profiles to select personalised content\nMeasure advertising performance\nMeasure content performance\nUnderstand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources\nDevelop and improve services\nUse limited data to select content\nSpecial Purposes\nVendors can:\n\nEnsure security, prevent and detect fraud, and fix errors\nDeliver and present advertising and content\nSave and communicate privacy choices\n\nFeatures\nVendors can:\n\nMatch and combine data from other data sources\nLink different devices\nIdentify devices based on information transmitted automatically\n\nSpecial Features\nVendors can:\nUse precise geolocation data\nActively scan device characteristics for identification\nSome partners do not ask for your consent to process your data, instead, they rely on their legitimate business interest.
