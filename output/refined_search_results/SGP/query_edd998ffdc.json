It includes the collection, transportation, processing, recycling, and disposal of waste materials in a manner that is environmentally responsible and sustainable. The market also involves the development and implementation of technologies and practices that promote waste reduction, resource recovery, and the safe handling of hazardous materials.\nKey components of the waste disposal market include waste collection services, recycling facilities, waste-to-energy plants, landfill operations, and environmental consulting services. As awareness of environmental issues grows, the waste disposal market continues to expand, driven by growing population, technological advancements, and increasing public demand for sustainable waste solutions.\nGovernment Initiatives Fuels the Growth of the Market in the Country\nThe government initiatives fuel the growth of the waste management market in Singapore. Policies and programs aimed at promoting recycling, reducing waste, and encouraging sustainable practices drive the Singapore waste management market demand for advanced collection solutions. As per the latest report published by National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS), the Singapore government introduced Zero Waste Masterplan to improve Singapore’s overall recycling rate to 70% by 2030. These initiatives help create a robust framework for waste collection, supporting market expansion and fostering innovation in the sector.\nInnovative Product Launches by Key Market Players Propels the Market Growth\nThe innovative product launches by key market players are fueling the growth of the waste management market in the country. These new products enhance efficiency and effectiveness in waste processing, driving demand and fostering industry expansion. For example, in April 2022, World Wide Fund (WWF) for Nature Singapore launched a pilot initiative designed to reduce e-commerce packaging waste in Singapore.  These innovations not only meet regulatory standards but also cater to the growing environmental awareness among consumers, further accelerating Singapore waste management market growth.\nSource : Next Move Strategy Consulting\nStringent Compliance Requirements and Regulatory Frameworks Hinders the Market Growth\nThe rigorous compliance requirements and extensive regulatory frameworks imposed by authorities significantly increase operational costs and limit market entry for new players that hinders the growth of the market. These stringent regulations are designed to ensure environmental protection, public health, and safety, but they also place a heavy burden on companies operating in the waste management sector and delays the market entry.\nThe Adoption of Waste-To-Energy Technologies Creates Future Growth Opportunities in the Market\nThe adoption of waste-to-energy technologies such as incineration, anaerobic digestion, and gasification presents a significant growth opportunity for the Singapore waste management market as these technologies convert waste materials into usable energy, reducing landfill dependency and contributing to sustainable energy generation.\nBy transforming waste into a valuable resource, waste-to-energy solutions promote environmental sustainability and drive market expansion. This innovative approach aligns with Singapore waste management market trends toward circular economy practices and offers economic benefits by generating energy from waste that creates a promising avenue for growth of the waste disposal sector.\nSource : Next Move Strategy Consulting\nCompetitive Landscape\nThe promising key players operating in the Singapore waste management industry includes Greenway, Da Engineering Pte Ltd., Skyline Environmental Pte Ltd., SembWaste Pte Ltd, Veolia ES Singapore, 800 Super Holdings Limited, Eco Special Waste Management Pte Ltd, Colex Holdings Pte Ltd, TEE Environmental Pte.

(Golder) was commissioned by the National Environment Agency (NEA) to develop a Waste Management Technology Roadmap (“Project”) that establishes pathways addressing Research, Development, Demonstration and Deployment (RDD&D) to achieve 2030 vision goals, which include minimising land footprint and environmental impacts for waste management activities, maximising manpower productivity while maintaining high standard levels of public health, keeping the cost of waste disposal affordable, maximising energy recovery from standard waste (waste as a resource) and maximising recycling in meeting the national recycling target of 70% by 2030.\nThe approach to the roadmapping exercise included a review of current and best practices, developing and emerging trends in the waste management technologies internationally addressing various waste sectors covering collection, sorting, upcycling and treatment. Significant in addressing the requirements of the Waste Management Technology Roadmap are the implications of implementing the recommended technologies in Singapore. To address the specific items identified and their consequential aspects and impacts, a set of technological pathways pathway was proposed. Waste Collection Waste collection technologies were screened to achieve the following: To increase manpower productivity • To continue rolling out Pneumatic Waste Conveyance System (PWCS) for high rise buildings in selected estates and neighbourhoods; • To roll out pilot sensor-based bin at kerbside, bin centres and centralised refuse room and a unified route optimisation software to be used by all Public Waste Collectors (PWCs) and General Waste Collectors (GWCs).\nSeparation of dry recyclables and mixed waste fractions • To facilitate public education and community promotion of waste prevention, waste minimisation, source segregation and recycling; • To encourage waste reduction measures to be put in place. Usage based charge system • To test a RFID tracking system for high rise residential buildings together with incentives (e.g. rebates in monthly utility bill, etc.) to encourage proper recycling habits and to support a usage based charge system; Integration To initiate Research & Development (R&D) on using autonomous vehicles for waste collection.\nWaste Sorting Materials Recovery Facilities (MRF) and Mechanical Biological Treatment (MBT) options have been reviewed as waste sorting / segregation technologies.\nMBT configurations that were screened and assessed were as follows: • MBT A – Mechanical separation with production of Solid Recovered Fuel (SRF).\n• MBT B – Waste to biogas and fertiliser via Anaerobic Digestion (AD).\n• MBT C – Waste to biofuel and renewable energy via gasification and fermentation.\n2 Waste Upcycling The review of recycling/upcycling technologies are focused on the three waste streams of food, plastic and paper wastes, due to their high volume and low recycling rates. Food Waste • Option A – Anaerobic Co-Digestion of Food Waste and Wastewater Sludge • Option B – Hydrothermal Carbonisation • Option C – Enzymatic conversion of food wastes Plastic Waste • Option A – Plastic waste to Carbon nanotubes (CNT) • Option B – Plastic waste to Fuel • Option C – Plastic waste to Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) Paper Waste The following recycling technologies are shortlisted for review and assessment: • Option A – Paper waste to cellulose aerogels • Option B – Paper waste to butanol • Option C – Paper waste to Pro-fibre Waste Treatment Thermal technologies dealing with Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) are referred as waste treatment technologies. Because of its ability in volume reduction, mass burn Waste-to-Energy (WTE) technology is applied as the primary waste disposal method in Singapore. The following alternative thermal treatments are shortlisted for further analysis against the base case of mass burn WTE technology: • Pyrolysis and Gasification • Slagging Gasification • Plasma Gasification 3 1.0 CURRENT WASTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND ITS CHALLENGES Singapore has a population of 5.54 million as of 2015 and with an expected increase in population, waste generation is expected to increase correspondingly.\nWithin the entire waste management process, there are two general areas which may be targeted to deal with the increased amount of waste. The first is to increase the recycling rates and second is to reduce the volume of waste generated. Since the launch of the National Recycling Programme (NRP) in 2001, the total recycling rate has increased from 40% in 2000 to 61% in 2015. A breakdown of the key waste streams has been provided in Table 1.\nTable 1: Breakdown of Top 5 Waste Streams Generated in 2015 (from NEA statistics) Rank Waste Stream Waste Generated (tonnes) Waste Disposed (tonnes) Percentage of Total Waste Gen­ erated Percentage of Total Waste Dis­ posed Recycling Rate 1 Construction Debris 1,411,800 8,900 18.4% 0.3% 99% 2 Ferrous Metal 1,348,500 15,200 17.6% 0.5% 99% 3 Paper / Cardboard 1,192,200 588,500 15.5% 19.5% 51% 4 Plastics 824,600 766,800 10.7% 25.4% 7% 5 Food 785,500 681,400 10.2% 22.5% 13% The top five waste streams made up more than 72% of the total waste generated in Singapore. The top two waste streams, namely, construction debris and ferrous metal achieved high recycling rates of 99%. Conversely, the next three waste streams, namely, paper, plastic and food had low recycling rates. These streams contributed to the total waste disposal rates of 19.5%, 25.4% and 22.5%, respectively.\nThe primary method of dealing with non-recycled waste in Singapore is incineration, which significantly reduces the volume of waste and harnesses its calorific value to recover energy in the form of electricity. The waste management process flow in Singapore is illustrated in Figure 1.\nCollec&on Sor&ng & Segrega&on Recycling Treatment Disposal Figure 1: Waste Management Process Flow in Singapore 4 1.1 Waste Collection In Singapore, depending on the geographical areas and type of premises, general waste is collected either by the Public Waste Collectors (PWCs) or individual General Waste Collectors (GWCs) licensed by the National Environment Agency (NEA).\nHigh-rise buildings including public housing estates, private condominiums, and /or shopping and commercial complexes are typically equipped with a refuse chute system. Individual households either have a refuse chute each that feeds directly to a common bin chamber at ground level or have a centralised refuse chute system on each floor located at the lift lobbies. Waste from the common bin chambers have to be transferred by workers to compactors located at bin centre for collection. Waste is collected directly from the centralised refuse chute via a fixed dust-screw system by trucks.\nCurrent methods of collection and transportation of waste may result in sanitary, odour and pest problems, as waste spillage can occur during the transferring process. Regular washing of the waste receptacle areas are required to keep the estate clean. Landed properties including residential premises, shop houses, and trade premises are each provided with a bulk bin (volume ranging from 120 to 1,100 litres depending on the refuse output) located in front of each premises along the roadway. These refuse bins are emptied into a collection truck that is generally staffed with two collection crew moving from door to door. The removal of wastes in a timely and hygienic manner is challenging in Singapore’s warm and humid weather. General waste, include household organic waste requires timely removal for treatment and disposal. Hence, general waste is collected and disposed of daily as the temporary storage of such waste could poses odour nuisance and vector problems to those living within the vicinity of bins, bin centres and refuse rooms. In summary, the waste collection method and process consists of the following: • Usage of single chute or bulk bin system; • Storage of mixed waste prior to collection; and • Daily collection by truck and crew.\nThe challenges identified with the current situation include: • The daily collection frequency required due to a warm and humid climate; • The high labour intensity and low efficiency; • Difficulty to hire and retain manpower; • Limitation of the single chute system to allow for source segregation; • Odour and pest nuisance caused by improper maintenance of refuse bins and collection trucks; and • High public expectation in hygiene and cleanliness. Potential solutions include: • Adoption of a dual / multiple chute system; • Mechanising the refuse collection process through Pneumatic Waste Conveyance System (PWCS); • Optimisation of truck collection routes; and • Adoption of collection trucks with features to minimise manpower and fuel consumption. 5 1.2 Waste Sorting and Segregation Separating different types of waste streams is essential for enabling recovery of useful and valuable materials as well as minimising the waste sent for incineration at Waste-to-Energy (WTE) plants. Under the NRP, commingled recyclables are collected by the PWCs and sorted at MRFs. Such facilities are generally small scale with processing capacity less than 50 tonnes per day. Their operations are manpower intensive and incurring a high operating cost. In addition, odour and hygiene issues are also of concern. In summary, the waste sorting and segregation processes consist of the following: • Obtaining commingled recyclables from PWCs under the NRP; • Occur at mostly small scale MRFs; and • Require manual sorting of recyclables.\nThe challenges identified with the current situation include: • High labour intensity and low efficiency; • High land uptake by MRFs; • Cannot take in wet recyclables or recyclables contaminated with organic waste; and • Exposure of workers to odour, grime and potential health risks associated with handling of wastes. Potential solutions include: • Increased automation of MRFs with higher productivity and recovery yield; • Utilising MBT to sort and/or treat MSW; and • Building multiple-tiered sorting facilities to minimise land footprint.\n6 1.3 Waste Recycling Based on statistics in 2015, paper/cardboard, plastic, and food waste made up about 67% of the total waste disposed of (Figure 2). To achieve the national recycling target of 70% by 2030, better recycling and upcycling methods of these three dominant waste streams could be pursued through technology innovations.\nFigure 2: Waste Recycled and Disposed in 2015 (based on Singapore Waste Statistics 2015) Other than commercial and demolition waste and ferrous metals, paper is among the most commonly recycled stream with approximately 51% out of the 1.19 million tonnes generated being recycled. Paper is sorted, baled, and exported overseas for recycling.\nOnly 7% of plastic waste was recycled out of the 0.82 million tonnes generated. Plastic waste is usually mechanically processed via sorting, shredding and washing as secondary raw material for making products with equivalent or similar properties. However, technological advancements could allow their upcycling into higher-value products such as depolymerisation of waste plastics into chemical constituents or conversion into fuel.\nOnly 13% of the food waste out of 0.79 million tonnes generated was recycled. The high costs involved in separate collection of food waste for recycling pose great challenges to increase their recycling rate. Although a small amount of food waste is processed into animal feed, there is also a low demand for turning it into compost due to scarcity of agricultural land. To encourage food waste recycling, the effective source segregation of organics from inorganic waste will need to be carried out.\nThe challenges identified with the current situation include: • Lack of public participation in recycling; • Low value of and / or lack of market demand of recovered materials; and • Promote recycling of specific waste streams (e.g. plastics, food waste). Existing potential solutions include: • Food waste segregation and onsite/offsite treatment; and • Upcycling waste to new materials or products with higher values. 7 1.4 Waste Treatment Singapore has adopted waste incineration as the treatment method due to land scarcity, among other factors. Incineration reduces waste volume by 90%. The mass burn WTE technology remains the dominant method to treat MSW as it allows the recovery of energy. Singapore has four WTE or Incineration Plants that treated 2.88 million tonnes of waste and generated 2 – 3% of total electricity in 2015 (Figure 3). A new WTE plant is planned to start operation in 2019. The electrical efficiency of a WTE plant is largely dependent on the net calorific value of the waste, size and design of the plant. The efficiency of existing WTE plants range from 15% to 20%. The efficiency of new generation mass burn WTE plants could achieve 23% and higher. Figure 3: Current WTE IPs in Singapore Singapore faces the following challenges on waste treatment: • Building new WTE plants with bigger capacities to cater to the projected increase in waste generation; • Limited land available for the construction of new WTE plants; and • Lowering the carbon and other gaseous emissions from WTE plants. With the current situation, the following opportunities are identified: • Adopting cost effective treatment technologies with higher resource and energy recovery; • Developing alternative thermal treatment technologies to produce high value products; and • Incorporating advanced flue gas cleaning system to minimise environmental impacts. 1.5 Waste Disposal Singapore’s only landfill is located at Pulau Semakau, an island to the south of the main island. The status quo of waste disposal at this landfill is as follows: • 0.19 million tonnes of waste was landfilled in 20151 (2% of total waste generated); • Only incineration ash and non-incinerable waste are landfilled; and • Based on the current rate of waste landfilled per year, the Semakau Landfill space is expected to be fully filled up by 2035.\nThe major challenge is to minimise residual waste sent to the landfill and thereby prolong the lifespan of Semakau Landfill. An identified opportunity lies in the use of Incineration Bottom Ash (IBA), after recovering of metals present in IBA. A facility to recover both ferrous and non-ferrous metals from IBA has started operation in mid-2015.\n1 Waste Statistics and Recycling Rate for 2015 8 2.0 2030 VISION OF A SUSTAINABLE SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM Singapore aims to achieve a 70% overall recycling rate by 2030 set out in the Singapore Sustainability Blueprint 2015. Singapore has implemented numerous waste recycling programmes and achieved an overall recycling rate of 61% in 2015. In order to achieve the 70% recycling target, emerging technologies will have to be adopted and developed to further convert residual waste streams into resources. In addition, advanced technologies embedded in the municipal waste management infrastructures will make a difference to people’s lives in terms of raising the productivity and efficiency, in line with the principles of the Smart Nation Programme.\nThe following challenges have been identified towards pursuing the 2030 vision of a more sustainable waste management system: • Increasing the manpower productivity in waste collection and sorting activities; • Increasing the yield of materials recovery via highly automated MRF; • Increasing the recycling rates of the top three disposed waste streams, i.e. paper, plastic and food; • Facing land constraint for waste management activities including building of WTE plants and landfill; • Ensuring the cost effectiveness and affordability of new and emerging technologies; and • Maintaining high standards of public health and minimising environmental concerns arising from waste management activities. 2.1 Vision The vision is to establish Singapore’s global leadership in utilising leading-edge technologies in solid waste management while addressing our inherent challenges and achieving the following: • Maintaining a high level of public health; • Minimising land footprint and environmental impacts; • Maximising manpower productivity; • Maximising energy recovery through improving existing and alternative WTE technology options; • Maximising resource recovery to achieve the 70% overall recycling target; and • Keeping the cost of waste disposal affordable.\n9 3.0 APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY The approach and methodology utilised in this Project is premised on the concepts of sustainability. The first priority is to identify technologies with the potential to realise the envisaged goals and targets befitting the 2030 vision. The identified technologies are then evaluated using a multi-criteria analysis framework (GoldSET©) that allows the systematic comparison of options. The multiple evaluation criteria are grouped into environmental, social, economic and technical dimensions, which provide the relative strengths and weaknesses of each option and inform on the RDD&D strategy. The four steps in the assessment approach are outlined in Figure 4.\nStep 1: Exploring Waste Management Technology Options This step includes listing and defining the possible waste management technology options that may be relevant to Singapore. The options have been developed into four categories: • Waste collection; • Waste sorting and separation; • Waste recycling; and • Waste treatment.\nThis list created was based on literature review and Golder’s global network of professional experience in waste management project executions. Step 2: Priority Assessment The options were put through a priority assessment that is designed to shortlist options that can significantly contribute to the 2030 vision. Table 2: Focus of Study – Screening Criteria for Priority Assessment Waste Collection • Enhance manpower productivity • Facilitate dry and wet waste separation • Encourage recycling by individual • Suitability for Singapore’s predominantly high-rise residential buildings Waste Sorting and Separation • Enhance land productivity • Enhance manpower productivity • Improve resource recovery Waste Recycling • Sustain recycling business • Ensure market demands of by-products • Create high value products Waste Treatment • Improve energy and resource recovery • Minimise residues send to landfill • Minimise environmental impacts Upon completion of the priority assessment, technologies that meet these conditions were subjected to the multi-criteria analysis under Step 3. 10 Step 3: Sustainability Evaluation - GoldSET© The options that are identified through the initial priority assessment were further evaluated using Golder’s sustainability framework tool GoldSET©. This tool evaluates each option on the basis of environmental, social, economic and technical criteria. GoldSET© further prioritise the options based on the Roadmap objectives including; maintaining high levels of public health, minimising emissions and land footprint maximising recycling, and maximising resource and energy recovery. The options are ranked based on a scoring system and graphical output that shows how the score of each option relative to the others. Step 4: Research, Development, Demonstration & Deployment (RDD&D) Strategy The fourth step is to formulate the RDD&D strategy that forms the basis of the technology roadmapping exercise. Technology opportunities and barriers were summarised and the potential research and development activities were recommended. These recommendations take into consideration the potential policy changes and other control measures in proposing the technology roadmap with timeline extending to 2030. ERROR!

Figure 4: Technology Roadmap Evaluation Approach 11 4.0 SHORTLISTED TECHNOLOGIES AND THEIR RELEVANCE FOR RDD&D OPPORTUNITIES IN SINGAPORE 4.1 Waste Collection 4.1.1 PWCS The PWCS is an automated waste collection system which uses vacuum to convey waste via a network of underground pipes to a container in a centralised bin centre. The container when filled will be transported by truck for disposal. The entire waste collection process is automated, thereby reducing manpower requirements and increasing productivity. The PWCS also serves to mitigate the environmental and hygiene issues associated with open collection methods.\n4.1.2 Single-Chute Based Separation System A dual-chute system is installed in newer HDB blocks and private condominiums to boost recycling by households through deposition of recyclables at the designated chute. However for existing single-chute system in older high rise buildings make it difficult to separate dry recyclables and mixed waste at source. Technology has been developed to modify the single chute for segregation of different waste streams, and such system could be a convenient and yet a cost-effective option to implement source segregation. This modification of existing chute system avoids the costly construction of additional chute for the dry recyclables.\nDirect separation through control panels and multiple containers A single-chute based separation system consists of a control panel with buttons for selected waste types at the chute door and provision of multiple waste containers at the refuse room of the building. The chute hopper will open when a waste selection button is pressed. The PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) controlled separator head at the discharge point will direct the waste to the desired bin position.\nIndirect separation through colour bags and optical sorting In South Korea, waste disposal service fee is charged through the sale of colour-coded bags designated for collection of different type of waste. The users are required to separate their waste into the right colour coded bags which allow the waste collectors to easily identify and reject bags filled with the wrong type of waste. The bags are priced according to their colours (i.e. waste type) and sizes (volume). Fines are imposed on those caught not segregating their waste properly and/or not using the correct coloured bags.\n12 4.1.3 PAYT (Pay-As-You-Throw) / SAYR (Save-As-You-Reduce) Scheme by Use of RFID Tracking System PAYT is a usage-pricing model in which users are charged based on how much waste they throw away. This gives incentives to individual household to reduce the amount of waste to be disposed. Faced with a direct form of unit pricing for the waste they produced, households are motivated to recycle as much of their waste so that less waste need to be disposed through conventional disposal route. In this way, waste disposal resembles more closely to other utilities, where the customer pays the amount for the services provided.\nThree key components need to be in place for effective implementation of a PAYT / SAYR scheme are: 1) user identification system; 2) measuring the volume of waste generated; and 3) provision of a publicly acceptable charging scheme.\nAdvertised under the technical synonym ‘waste lock’ or ‘lockhopper’ by their producers, chamber waste storage systems require users to pass their waste through a special feeding chamber. Access to this chamber is allowed by means of a smart card or electronic key and the amount of waste deposited is recorded. The responsible authority can either bill the user or the system deducts a corresponding amount from prepaid credits. Devices on the market range from simple to fully automated mechanised or even solar-powered electro-mechanical systems.\n4.1.4 Bin-fill Wireless Sensor Technology Waste collection has been traditionally done using fixed routes and regular schedules regardless of whether the bins are filled to its capacity. The bin-fill sensor system uses smart wireless sensors to gather fill-level data from waste containers and use data analytics to generate the schedules and optimise the waste collection routes while taking into account an extensive set of parameters (future fill-level projections, truck availability, traffic information, road restrictions etc.). 4.1.5 Improved waste collection truck fleet – clean energy Clean fuels for refuse trucks include Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), electric hybrid, and biodiesel.\nHybrid (Hydraulic / Electric) – Hydraulic hybrid system captures about 70% of the kinetic energy that would otherwise be lost during braking. This energy drives a pump, which transfers hydraulic fluid from a low-pressure reservoir to a high-pressure accumulator. When the vehicle accelerates, the fluid in the high-pressure accumulator drives a motor, which provides the extra torque.\nElectric hybrid systems also capture energy from braking of the vehicle and store it in a battery pack. The batteries are largely used to drive a motor to provide additional power during acceleration. This reduces the amount of fuel used and produces less emission.\nBiodiesel – Biodiesel refers to vegetable oil or animal fat-based diesel fuel consisting of long-chain alkyl esters. It can be used alone or blended with diesel.\n4.1.6 Automated Collection Trucks (Unmanned) As of 2013, four US states have enacted laws addressing autonomous vehicles. In 2011, driverless haul trucks were reportedly used by Rio Tinto for haulage of ore material and waste at its mining operations in Western Australia. Experts at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers have estimated that up to 75% of all vehicles will be autonomous by 2040.\nWaste collection trucks with automated functions are able to transfer waste from bins at roadside into the truck’s hopper without the need for driver and collection crew. 13 4.1.7 Collection route optimisation software Geographic Information System (GIS)-based modelling software is able to provide optimised collection routes for high density residential areas; point-to-point commercial premises; and collecting special waste. It can balance route times; service days; optimises travel paths; and reduces the time and cost associated with planning and updating the routes. 4.2 Waste Sorting & Separation –MRF A review of advanced MRFs was conducted on their overall performance especially for facilities that incorporated advanced auto-sorting technologies. While local sorting facilities are heavily dependent on manual separation efforts, modern MRFs in Europe and North America have shown to have higher land productivity, material recovery yield and manpower productivity. In the US, MRFs are designed either for processing single stream or mixed MSW. The former refers to commingled dry recyclables including paper, plastic, metal and glass while the latter is for mixed municipal waste including recyclables and non-recyclables with the presence of organic compounds. Depending on the purpose of the MRF, whether it is to process single-stream recycling or mixed MSW, an advanced MRF usually combines a series of disc screens, air classifiers, optical sorters, glass sorters, metal separators (ferrous and non-ferrous) in various orders. In addition, it would likely to have pre-sorting and QA/QC work being performed manually by workers prior to packaging and baling of sorted recyclables for further processing. Biological treatment can be added to an advanced MRF to treat organic compounds as required, which is discussed in the section below.\n4.3 Waste Sorting & Separation –MBT MBT technologies present an alternative treatment solution for reducing the amount of MSW send to the WTE plants or landfill. MBT comprises a series of separation and sorting technologies to separate the organic fractions and recover recyclables and the processes are integrated with biological treatment of the organic fractions.\nThe possible MBT options are in production of: 1) biogas and other resources; 2) compost; and 3) Solid Recovered Fuel (SRF). With regard to Singapore’s context, composting may not be a viable option due to its need for large land footprint as well as the limited demands for compost. 4.4 Waste Upcycling – Food Only 13% of food waste out of 0.79 million tonnes generated was recycled in 2015. The costs of food waste recycling pose great challenges and there is lack of demands for compost, which minimises the recycling options. However, food waste upcycling may be viable for Singapore if segregation of organic materials can be effectively carried out. The different food waste upcycling technology options were reviewed and compared against the incineration of food waste. Three broad types of technological options are: Option A - co-digestion of food waste and used water sludge, Option B - hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC) of food waste to hydro-char, and Option C - enzymatic conversion of food waste to produce succinic acid and bioethanol.\n14 4.4.1 Option A – Anaerobic Co-Digestion of Food Waste and Wastewater Sludge Anaerobic co-digestion of food waste and used water sludge may offer a viable solution to converting these waste streams to fertilisers (which may be exported if there is a lack of demand in Singapore) and biogas to produce electricity. Evidence has shown that the AD of food waste alone may be unstable due to a lack of trace elements essential for methanogenesis. A lab-scale study on food waste and used water sludge co-digestion by the Nanyang Environment and Water Research Institute (NEWRI) in the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) was initiated to determine the technical feasibility and the optimal operational conditions for the co-digestion process. 4.4.2 Option B – HTC of Food Waste to Hydro-Char This lab-scale technology uses HTC to convert MSW (including food waste) into sterilised value-added hydro-char. During HTC, the feedstock is heated to subcritical water temperature (from 180 – 350°C) at autogenous pressures. As a result, the feedstock is decomposed via simultaneous reactions including hydrolysis, dehydration, decarboxylation, aromatisation, and recondensation in which hydro-char and wastewater are generated as by-products. Possible uses of hydro-char include adsorbent for environmental remediation, solid fuel and soil augmentation. 4.4.3 Option C – Enzymatic Conversion of Food Waste Enzymatic conversion of food waste to value added products has been demonstrated in lab-scale studies. One approach is to use source-separated food waste for the production of bio-ethanol at high dry materials content (45% Dry Matter, DM) via microbial fermentation process. The final ethanol yield was about 108 g/kg dry material.\n4.5 Waste Upcycling – Plastic In 2015, only 7% of plastic waste of the 0.82 million tonnes generated was recycled. Plastic waste is usually recycled through mechanical processes including sorting, shredding, and washing. Generally, waste plastic can be processed or converted into products with equivalent or similar properties. Three different types of plastic waste upcycling technologies were reviewed and compared against the incineration of plastic waste. These options are: Option A - Plastic to Carbon Nanotubes (CNT), Option B – Plastic to Fuel, and Option C – Plastic to Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA). 4.5.1 Option A – Plastic Waste to CNT This lab-scale technology utilises a nanotechnological approach to convert non-degradable grocery plastic bags into carbon nanotube membranes with tuneable molecular transport properties. In this process, plastic bags are the carbon source and the CNTs are produced by a catalyst/solvent-free Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) which take place at temperature of 850ºC for 30 minutes. CNTs are grown inside nanoporous anodic alumina membranes (NAAMs), which enable control over the nanotubes’ organisation and geometry. Possible applications of CNT include filtration, sensing, energy storage and a range of biomedical innovations.\n15 4.5.2 Option B – Plastic Waste to Fuel This technology converts batches of shredded and densified different types of plastic to synthetic crude oil under heat. The plastic feedstock is placed in an airtight processing vessel which is heated to temperatures ranging from 300°C to 600°C. The plastic depolymerise as it transforms from a solid to liquid and to a gaseous phase. Through a combination of temperature and vacuum, the gases are cooled in a condensing system into synthetic crude oil. Feedstock impurities are separated out into char and the synthetic crude oil is transferred to an exterior tank ready for transport to a refinery to be refined into valuable products.\n4.5.3 Option C – Plastic Waste to PHA This lab-scale technology comprises a two-step process. In the first step, plastic wastes are subjected to high temperature ranging from 400 to 900°C under anaerobic conditions using a pyrolysis system. The polymer is broken into gaseous hydrocarbon products and condensed into a hydrocarbon-rich oil mixture. In the second step, the oil mixture is fed to a fermenter with microorganisms that utilise the oil mixture to produce PHAs. PHA can then be extracted from the accumulating microorganism for the production of biodegradable PHA polymers which can be used to produce plastic films for bags, containers and paper coatings, in disposable articles (personal care products, surgery clothes), upholstery, packages, medical implants, sutures, etc. 4.6 Waste Recycling – Paper Paper is one of the most common waste streams recycled in Singapore. Approximately 51% of paper waste was recycled out of 1.19 million tonnes generated in 2015. Most of the paper waste is sorted, baled, and exported overseas for recycling.\nThe different paper waste recycling technology options were reviewed and compared against incineration of paper waste. Three types of technological options are: Option A – Paper waste to cellulose aerogels, Option B – Paper waste to butanol, and Option C – Paper waste to pro-fibre.\n4.6.1 Option A – Paper Waste to Cellulose Aerogels The National University of Singapore (NUS) has developed technology to recycle cellulose fibers from paper waste as raw materials to produce cellulose aerogels. The aerogels were prepared using a sodium hydroxide/urea treatment method (includes sonication) followed by freeze-drying the aerogels without destroying their structure and preventing the porous structure from collapsing. This technology has been successfully demonstrated at lab-scale in producing cellulose aerogel with high water and oil absorption capacities. The aerogels possess the flexibility and potential to be further processed for use in thermal and acoustic insulation, as well as absorbent media, opening the possibilities of manufacturing a broad spectrum of high value-added products. 4.6.2 Option B – Paper Waste to Butanol For this lab-scale study, recycled cellulose from newspaper is utilised as feedstock for microbial production of butanol in the presence of oxygen. While other bacteria have been found to produce butanol in the past, they have all required an oxygen-free environment, which increases production costs.\n16 4.6.3 Option C – Paper Waste to Pro-fibre The technology transforms non-recyclable fibers (e.g. paper and cardboard) into pulp product named ‘Pro-Fibre’ that can be used in insulation material, packaging products, and construction materials such as plaster boards. The technology uses a five-step process involving identifying and capturing the non-recyclable fiber fragments, pulping, cleaning, screening and mechanical pressing. 4.7 Thermal Treatment 4.7.1 Thermal A – Pyrolysis + Gasification Pyrolysis is a thermochemical process that converts the organic fraction of waste into biofuel, char and gaseous compounds in the absence of air or oxygen. It is considered an attractive alternative to mass burn for MSW as pyrolysis has the potential to provide resource recovery in addition to energy.\nPyrolysis for MSW can be utilised alone or in combination with other thermal technologies. A review of existing systems shows that most pyrolysis facilities are coupled with gasification or a combustion stage. The output products from most commercial systems are mainly in the form of power or heat, reformed syngas and/or char. Pre-treatment which include the separation of undesirable materials, size reduction, drying to reduce moisture content, etc. is necessary for MSW pyrolysis technology. Additional processing or treatment is required if the products are intended for immediate utilisation (e.g. gas scrubbing prior to feed in a combustion chamber or a gas engine) or char quenching to ensure quality of such products for industrial uses.\nThe features of the Pyrolysis process are described in outline below.\n1) Low emission of dioxins and generation of fly ash – generated gas is held at 1200°C for 2 seconds or longer, followed by quenching to approximately 70°C in an oxygen-free condition to suppress the generation of dioxins, and is recovered as syngas.\n2) High levels of recycling of wastes is possible – waste input is converted into purified syngas or recovered in the form of granulated slag, metals, metal hydroxides, sulphur, mixed salts, and other substances which can be used effectively as resources, resulting in minimised landfill disposal.\n3) Syngas can be recovered by gas reforming – since the main components of the recovered syngas are H2 and CO, the gas can be used as a fuel for power generation and also as a chemical feedstock. The fuel gas is applicable to a wide range of power generation methods including gas engine, fuel cell, gas-fired boiler, and gas turbine combined-cycle power generation. This broad use profile allows selection of an optimum generation method from the viewpoints of equipment scale and site variables.\n4) The process offers suitable economic performance – the process utilises the energy contained in waste to perform melting and eliminates the need for separate treatment processes for dioxins and fly ash with high heavy metal contents. As a result, the cost is advantageous compared to conventional “incinerator ash melting”. The process minimises the need for landfill disposal.\nFigure 5 below presents a Pyrolysis cum Gasification process configuration. In the process, waste is compacted, dried and then pyrolysed by indirect heating in a degassing channel. The pyrolysed waste product is then charged into the high temperature reactor, where it is gasified and the ash is melted at high temperature by reaction with oxygen. This gas passes through the quenching and purifying process as clean syngas.\n17 Figure 5: Pyrolysis + Gasification Process 4.7.2 Thermal B – Slagging Gasification / Shaft Type In order to prolong the lifespan of the Semakau Landfill, it is necessary to look at waste treatment technologies with the potential to reduce residues generation that need to be landfilled. Slagging gasification was developed in Japan can significantly reduce the volume of waste residues that needs to be landfilled. The technology was also driven by the regulations for dioxin emission control and detoxifying ash. The Japanese experience has demonstrated that slags from the process can be safely used as aggregates and the metals recovered are recycled. The volatile metals and fly ash captured through the flue gas treatment will still require treatment prior to its safe disposal at landfills.\nAs indicated in Figure 6 below, the shaft type system has a gasification and melting furnace where combustible organics in waste will be gasified and the syngas is fed into the combustion chambers, while non-combustible metals and minerals will be melted in the high temperature molten slagging layer at the bottom of the furnace. The molten layer that flows out of the furnace is quenched in water or air to form granulated slag and metals.\nFigure 6: Slagging Gasification - Shaft Type 18 4.7.3 Thermal C – Gasification + Plasma Plasma gasification uses electrical energy to create high temperature (>2,000ºC) plasma arc for waste gasification. The plasma arc effectively breaks down the waste material into elemental molecules and produces syngas and inert vitreous slag as outputs. The plasma gasification process has the potential to recirculate some hazardous fly ash back into gasifier for vitrification into a non-hazardous glassy slag. For example, slag generated from the Mihama-Mikata plasma gasification plant in Japan is used as aggregate for concrete products. This slag has the potential for use as rock wool, landfill cover, reclamation purposes, base material for construction, landscaping blocks, asphalt road and pavement aggregate among other possible applications. However, the downside of plasma systems is the high capital cost and operational expenses of the technology. Plasma gasification process is extremely energy intensive and the wear on the plasma chamber is high, subsequently requiring high quality materials, frequent maintenance and replacement.\nFigure 7: Gasification + Plasma Process 4.7.4 Thermal D – Slagging Gasification / Fluidised Bed Gasification The fluidised bed gasification and melting process consists of partial combustion of debagged and shredded MSW in a fluidised bed reactor at temperatures between 500 - 600°C followed by a second furnace where flue gas and carbonaceous particles, both produced in the fluidised bed reactor, are combusted at temperatures between 1350-1450°C by the addition of secondary air. The ash overflow from the fluidised bed is separated from the sand used in the reactor for fluidisation. Separation is by means of an inclined vibrating screen with 3-4 mm openings. The sand passes through the screen while glass and metal particles are trapped at the screen and vitrified as they proceed through the furnace. The molten slag is quenched in a water bath to form granulate that can be potentially utilised for construction purposes. The gasifier and ash melting furnace operate at atmospheric conditions without consumption of added fossil fuels (except for start-up) and oxygen.\nThis technology is able to process mixed MSW, SRF, automobile shredder residue (ASR), waste plastics, sewage sludge and medical wastes. It combines energy and material recovery as well as destruction of organic contaminants. Removal of large items and shredding of MSW are required to ensure homogeneity of the waste feed.\n19 One such facility using this technology is located in Kawaguchi city, Japan. The gasification/ ash melting system at the Kawaguchi City, Asahi Clean Centre is able to process 420 tonnes/ day MSW (3 x 140 tonnes/day modules operating 24 hours). The plant produces 12MW of energy from a steam boiler and power cycle process. The net energy efficiency is reported to be approximately 15%. Slag is sold for USD 2 per tonne as construction aggregate while recovered iron and aluminium are sold into the commercial commodities market. The facility operates with a tipping fee of USD 150 per tonne of MSW. Figure 8: Slagging Gasification / Fluidised Bed Gasification Process 4.7.5 Base Case – Mass Burn Mass burn technology refers to incineration of MSW as received while generating energy (power and heat). Waste is tipped into a holding area (1) where it is picked up by a hoist and dropped into a hopper (2). The waste is pushed gradually into the incinerator (3) which runs at a temperature of approximately 750 °C (or over). Heat from burning waste is used in a boiler (4) and steam from this is piped to a turbine generator to create electricity. The heaviest ash falls into a collection point (5) and is typically passed over with an electromagnet to extract metal content for recycling. Flue gas containing fine ash then passes through a scrubber reactor (6) to treat acid pollutants such as SO2 and to treat dioxins. The exhaust gases then pass through a fine particulate removal system (7) and are released through the chimney stack (8).\nFigure 9: Mass burn process 20 Mass burn is a mature technology which has been around for more than 70 years. Though technological developments have taken place in terms of advanced pollution control equipment and better energy recovery efficiency, much of their adoption will depend on the policy and legislation specific to each country. For example, modern pollution control technologies have reduced air emissions from waste incinerators to very low levels . Continuous process development is on-going to lower operating costs, improving process and environmental performances. The challenge for this technology is the generation of IBA and IFA which will require further processing and treatment for utilisation in applications or to be disposed of at landfill.\nGiven these on-going improvements, there are still a number of areas that can be considered for improvements including energy efficiency in mass burn WTE facilities. A WTE plant built by the Afval Energie Bedrijf (AEB) in the Netherlands is an example of how incinerators can attain both high energy and materials recovery. The plant processes 530,000 tonnes of waste per year and the net electrical efficiency is reported to be more than 30%, which is one of the world’s highest . With an average caloric value of 10 GJ/tonne of MSW, the plant with a set steam turbine generator can generate a total of 57 MW electricity. The high energy efficiency is accomplished by a number of design features including; reheating steam cycle, low excess air ratio with flue gas recirculation, high steam temperature (440ºC) with inconel cladding, and pre-heating of boiler feed water. Another approach to boost the electricity efficiency from waste combustion is to employ external superheating. This could involve combining natural gas fired power plant operating on Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) where hot exhaust gases are used to further increased the “superheated” steam from the boiler of WTE plant to boost the steam turbine power cycle. For the Mainz WTE plant in Germany, steam from waste-fired boilers is piped to the water-steam circuit of a neighbouring 400 MW combined cycle power plant where the steam is further superheated to 550°C to be fed into the steam turbine. Similarly, the Zabalgarbi WTE plant in Bilbao, Spain, where the steam at 100 bar pressure from the waste-fired boiler is superheated to 540°C that operate as an integrated combined cycle power plant, results in overall net electrical efficiency exceeding 40%.\n5.0 IMPACT OF POTENTIAL TECHNOLOGY AND RDD&D STRATEGY ON VISION GoldSET© provides a systematic evaluation technology alternatives through the application of qualitative and quantitative indicators covering environmental, social, economic and technical dimensions. The proposed indicators and the scoring scheme are established through Golder’s past experiences and have gone through a series of internal consensus, reviews and revisions based on comments from stakeholders.\nThe evaluation is to assess individual technology options under each area of the study (i.e. collection, sorting, recycling and treatment). The GoldSET evaluation is not to present a conclusion for the best solution, but to explore and analyse the potential benefits and constraints from adopting the individual solution.\n21 5.1 Waste Collection The two key targets for waste collection technologies are to: 1) improve manpower efficiency; and 2) facilitate separation of dry recyclables and mixed waste. 5.1.1 Transportation ERROR! UNKNOWN DOCUMENT PROPERTY NAME. Error! Unknown document property name. No. 20 5.1.1 Transportation PWCS gives better overall performance compared to the other collection and transportation technologies. In the areas of energy requirement, technology potential, manpower efficiency, odour and pest nuisances, each of the option provides RDD&D opportunities in the Singapore context. Overall Score: 63 Overall Score: 56 Overall Score: 46 Overall Score: 39 PWCS gives better overall performance compared to the other collection and transportation technologies. In the areas of energy requirement, technology potential, manpower efficiency, odour and pest nuisances, each of the option provides RDD&D opportunities in the Singapore context.\n22 5.1.2 Chute-based Separation System • • Moderate to highly beneficial environmental outcomes, associated with the low energy requirement and reduction in air emissions/odours as it is likely to be contained within building. Source segregation of recyclables will result in high recovery yield from the subsequent sorting facilities. • • Moderately beneficial social outcomes, associated with moderate public acceptance to behavioural change to separate the waste. • • Moderately beneficial technical outcomes, associated with high technological development potential and moderate flexibility of waste types due to the limited space of the bin room of the block. • • Moderately beneficial economic outcomes, associated with moderate CAPEX and OPEX and high resource recovery potential. The system presents a low level for manpower efficiency as the amount of waste collected per trip will likely be reduced due to waste segregation space inefficiencies requiring additional trips to empty bins of segregated wastes.\n5.1.3 Bin System 23 • • Neutral environmental outcomes, with moderate reductions in air emissions due to reduction in collection truck trips. • • Moderately beneficial social outcomes, associated with little effect on the public compared to the current system. The system presents moderate score results considering level of odour and other pest nuisances as the bins will only be removed once the pre-determined threshold levels are exceeded. • • Moderate to highly beneficial technical outcomes, associated with high flexibility in expansion and in waste types and high technological potential. Minimum service disruption is expected as only maintenance of the sensor accuracy and internet connectivity will be required.\n• • Neutral economic outcomes, with moderate capital costs for retrofitting the current conventional bins. The OPEX is low for the bins and fuel/labour is expected to be reduced as fewer collection trips will be needed. 5.1.4 Pricing Scheme – PAYT / SAYR • • Moderately beneficial environmental outcomes, associated with high waste diversion from incineration plants. Fuel consumption of waste hauling vehicles is reduced as fewer vehicles will be needed. • • Moderate to highly beneficial social outcomes, associated with high behavioural change driven by the system in making the public more aware and responsible for managing their own waste. • • Moderate to highly beneficial technical outcomes, associated with high technological potential, and high flexibility in expansion and waste types. • • Neutral economic outcomes, with high capital costs for chute retrofitting, supporting IT facilities and RFID equipment to all households. 24 5.1.5 Recommendations PWCS PWCS has already been installed in some existing and new residential high rise buildings in Singapore. It helps to minimise odour, traffic congestion, hygiene concerns and other social impacts. The initial feedback of concern in using this system had been that the pipes can occasionally get blocked and there were some difficulties rectifying them. Research and planning are required for its implementation over a large area as transfer of waste over longer distances requires higher suction pressure. Distances may be a technical constraint as the maximum suction distance reported by technology provider Envac, is limited to 2 kilometres from the furthest inlet to the collection terminal. Through technology revolution for longer term, PWCS may be aimed as a potential solution for fully automated waste collection and transportation system that can transfer waste from source, i.e. the households all the way to disposal facilities.\nRoute optimisation software This technology can be integrated with other collection technologies to improve waste collection. This system would be optimal to work along with automated driverless trucks, and bin-fill wireless sensor technologies. Co-ordination among the waste collection companies (e.g. PWCs) would be needed so as to ensure a common platform exists among different waste collectors via the use of unified route optimisation software. Modelling simulation on traffic conditions and emissions can be done and factored into the route optimisation.\nA data centre would be required to house all the data in a centralised location. The data centre can be managed by either the authorities or a third party company, as observed in the overseas experience. Automated collection truck (Unmanned) Driverless vehicles are something to look forward to in the near future. Numerous automobile companies have developed working prototype of autonomous vehicles. Members of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers have estimated that up to 75% of all vehicles will be autonomous by 2040.\nR&D in automation for waste collection function using autonomous vehicles can be pursued.\nSingle-chute based separation system Segregation at the source is not implemented in Singapore, although voluntary based recycling programmes are available. Communications and public education on the benefits and importance of source segregation of recyclables may help to reduce pre-processing requirements.\nAs a number of technologies are available to facilitate waste segregation in single chute-based system in buildings, it is recommended to initiate a pilot project to test the performance. Public education and promotion on the proper use of such separation system need to be conducted prior to and during the implementation of the pilot. Upon successful implementation of the pilot projects and proof of performance of selected technologies, authorities may consider formulating policies and legislative standards to support source segregation. 25 Bin-fill wireless sensor technology This technology would integrate well with the route optimisation software system where the trucks can be assigned to collect waste from bins that are near filled in an efficient planned route. This avoids unnecessary waste collections when it is not required. However, the threshold for collection should be set in consideration of the potential odour or pest issues arising from the waste not being collected.\nTraining for the workers and technical support team would be needed if such a system is to be implemented. PAYT/SAYR scheme by use of RFID tracking system Motivation for waste reduction and recycling can be further strengthened through such a scheme. RFID system is able to provide a platform to support the PAYT/SAYR scheme. 5.2 Waste Sorting & Separation 5.2.1 MRF Based on the review of case studies, advanced MRFs are reportedly able to achieve a sorting efficiency of as high as 95% for recycling of single stream and 75% for MSW. The processing capacity for some facilities can be as high as 120 tonne per hour. High land efficiency is achievable through options to stack up conveying lines and sorting facilities. Manpower productivity can be significantly increased using highly automated sorted equipment and advanced control system.\nAdvanced automated MRFs: MRF A – mixed material recycling and MRF B – single-stream recycling were reviewed and compared against the base case of a conventional manual sorting facility. Both MRF A and MRF B show significantly better performance than the base case of conventional manual sorting facility. MRF B has similar results as MRF A with moderate to high beneficial environmental, technical and economic outcomes. Singapore is currently adopting the commingled recycling system and generally manual sorting of commingled dry recyclables including paper, plastic, glass and metal is done at the MRFs. An advanced single-stream MRF would have been the most suitable configuration for adoption for commingled recyclables.\nMRF B showed similar analysis results as MRF A as compared to the base case.\n26 5.2.2 MBT The MBT technologies are desired to maximise resource and energy recovery and to minimise residual waste being sent to the WTE plants or disposed of at landfill. MBT technologies can vary depending on the preferred processes or products in the local context. The different combined mechanical and biological processes that are able to deal with the organic fraction of the waste streams have been reviewed and compared against the base case of a conventional manual sorting facility with residual waste being incinerated at a mass burn plant. !\nERROR!!UNKNOWN!DOCUMENT!PROPERTY!NAME.!\n!\n!\nThe!MBT!options!are!ranked!well!as!compared!to!the!base!case!of!mass!burn!incineration.!In!the!areas!of!\nwaste! diversion! and! expansion! diversity,! each! of! the!

The MBT options are ranked well as compared to the base case of mass burn incineration. In the areas of waste diversion and expansion diversity, each of the MBT option provides RDD&D opportunities in the Singapore context. 5.3 Recommendations MRF A customised design would have to be made for each MRF based on targeted recycling of waste streams for best overall performance. Workers are generally required to hand pick bulky items or incompatible items from the conveyor belt, and workers are also needed for QA/QC purpose. With an advanced SCADA system, the entire MRF system or individual components can be controlled at the main control panel in which the manpower for site supervision and operational control can be greatly reduced. It is recommended that a detailed waste characterisation study is warranted in order to facilitate in the design and configuration of advanced MRF to increase sorting efficiency, recycling rate and manpower efficiency in the future. R&D can be on developing technologies to facilitate additional automation through use of robotic picking arms and sorters to further increase manpower efficiency.\nMBT The technology development focus should be on producing a modular, scalable and compact design of the MBT facility in order to minimise land footprint. MBT A – Mechanical Separation with Production of SRF Detailed waste composition studies are required so that SRF facility operators are able to plan processes and equipment required based on the waste composition. Establishment of SRF quality standards or specifications/guidelines (by ISO) may potentially help to ascertain SRF product quality. 27 MBT B – Waste to Biogas and Fertiliser via AD Market survey may be conducted to establish the demand. Research on mesophilic systems may be conducted as a wider diversity of bacteria thrives at mesophilic temperatures. These bacteria are generally more robust and adaptable to changing environmental conditions. MBT C – Waste to Biofuel and Renewable Energy via Gasification and Fermentation Research could be carried out on more efficient and cost effective means of converting low-grade syngas to value added chemicals. For example, research on more efficient biocatalysts, lower cost catalysts or other means of conversion in order to reduce OPEX can be conducted. In addition, development of an alternative pre-processing method which is less energy intensive than the current method (i.e. drying) will be beneficial. 5.3 Waste Recycling – Food Each of the alternative food waste treatments is ranked better than the base case of mass burn incineration. In the areas of technology potential and CO2 emissions, each of the treatments provides RDD&D opportunities in the Singapore context. Option A demonstrates the highest potential for RDD&D due to its favourable scores in the environmental, technical and economic dimensions. 28 5.3.1 Recommendations The technology development focus could be on producing more modular, scalable design of the facility and constructing the plant vertically or underground in order to minimise land footprint.\nOption A - Co-Digestion of Food Waste and Sewage Sludge R&D focus can be on optimising conditions in the digester. In addition, public education on the benefits and importance of source segregation of food waste would facilitate the successful implementation of this technology. Option B - HTC of Food Waste to Hydro-Char R&D is required to reduce the high energy requirement and costs associated. After which, efforts on upscaling and commercialising the technology can then be explored. Option C - Enzymatic conversion of food wastes R&D efforts could focus on optimising operating conditions for optimal enzymatic reactions and improving the robustness and flexibility of the enzymes to maximise the process performance and yield. A detailed food waste characterisation study could be carried out to identify certain chemical species (e.g. aromatic compounds, oil and grease) or microbes which may inhibit or destroy the catalytic activities of enzymes. 5.4 Waste Recycling – Plastic 29 Each of the proposed treatments is ranked similar or better than the base case of mass burn incineration. In the areas of recovery of value-added products, technology potential and CO2 emissions, each treatment provides RDD&D opportunities in the Singapore context. Option A demonstrates the highest potential for RDD&D due to its favourable scores in the environmental, technical and economic dimensions. 5.4.1 Recommendations Option A - Plastic waste to CNT One of the major challenges in upcycling plastic waste to CNT is a lack of consistent quality supply of carbon feedstock. Feedstock from recycling streams is typically mixed plastic types. Research and studies on emerging technologies such as (tribo) electrostatics, laser-induced plasma spectroscopy, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence, infrared (IR) and Raman methods, density media, and artificial neural networks (for spectral data analysis) in separating and sorting plastic to ensure its consistency and quality.\nResearch could focus on producing single-walled CNT instead of multi-walled CNT as they are of higher value and demand. In addition, single-walled CNT is generally more challenging to synthesise from plastic waste as compared to multi-walled CNT. Option B - Plastic waste to fuel Preliminary consultation with technology providers may help to understand the BAT and the feasibility of utilising this technology in Singapore’s context. Research could be carried out on more efficient and cost effective means of converting waste plastics to transportation fuel and other chemicals (e.g. lubricants) by optimising the pyrolysis process (e.g. temperature) in order to reduce the high energy requirement and costs. Option C - Plastic waste to PHA The yield and speed of PHA production will determine the commercial viability of this technology. This is dependent on the microorganisms which may require more in depth studies such as genetic engineering and synthetic biology. Research could be on optimising operating conditions for optimal microbial fermentation process and improving on the robustness and flexibility of the process to achieve control over process performance and yield.\nAs literature has shown that short-chained PHAs can be synthesised from plastic waste, research could focus on producing mid-chained PHAs that have more uses as compared to the short-chained PHAs.\n30 5.5 Waste Recycling – Paper The proposed technologies are ranked well than the base case of mass burn incineration. In the areas of technology potential and CO2 emissions, each option provides RDD&D opportunities in the Singapore context. Option A demonstrates the highest potential for RDD&D due to its favourable scores in the environmental, technical and economic dimensions.\n5.5.1 Recommendations For the implementation of all these options, communication and education of the public on the benefits and importance of source segregation of paper waste is essential to help in the downstream conversion process. Option A - Paper waste to cellulose aerogels R&D efforts could focus on reducing the energy requirements from freezing and freeze-drying. In addition, reducing the processing time for the conversion and use of chemicals would be beneficial for the commercial scale application of this technology.\n31 Option B - Paper waste to butanol R&D efforts could focus on optimising the microbial fermentation process (acetone–butanol– ethanol (ABE) fermentation) and improving the robustness and flexibility of the process to achieve process performance and yield. The commercial viability of this technology is dependent on the microorganism, which requires more in depth studies in genetic engineering and synthetic biology.\nAs this technology has been demonstrated to convert newspapers thus far, R&D efforts could focus on ensuring that the technology is effective towards complex, mixed or contaminated paper waste streams.\nOption C - Paper waste to Pro-fibre Technological developmental efforts are required in optimising the process flow to reduce the CAPEX and OPEX during its operational phase. 5.6 Thermal Treatment Each of the alternative thermal treatments is ranked similar or better than the base case of mass burn incineration. In the areas of MSW volume reduction, energy recovery, technology potential and CO2 emissions, each of the alternative thermal options provides RDD&D opportunities in the Singapore context. Thermal B demonstrates the highest potential for RDD&D due to its favourable scores in the environmental, technical and economic dimensions.\n32 5.6.1 Recommendations Thermal A – Pyrolysis + Gasification Combined pyrolysis and gasification technology can be a treatment option for MSW if the identified constraints and challenges can be overcome via R&D in the future. The technology is still at lab scale research and more R&D is required before a demonstration scale project on combined pyrolysis and gasification can be embarked on.\nThermal B & D – Slagging Gasification The capacities of slagging gasification facilities are of small scale as it is difficult to maintain the temperature at the centre of the gasifier. The largest module is 150 tonnes/day/furnace. Compared to mass burn WTE plants which are able to process 500 or more tonne/day for each line, a slagging gasification could be an option to supplement existing WTE plants. The technology providers are carrying out R&D to double the treatment capacity of the gasifier. In addition, R&D efforts on the use of alternative substitutes for coke that will not result in an increase in CO2 emission over mass burn incineration. Based on Golder’s literature review, most slagging gasification processes recover energy from the heat of the combustion of syngas using a steam cycle. But the challenge is in cleaning up the syngas for use in a gas engine or gas turbine which could reap higher thermal efficiency. Thermal C – Gasification + Plasma To keep tabs on the market assessment for development trends in plasma gasification as it could have potential for producing various types of fuels and chemical feedstock. Plasma gasification facilities if proven to be feasible can be co-located with or located near industrial facilities that require the end products. Infrastructure to handle the products such as pipelines, road transportation or electric interconnection distance needs to be considered for the location of the plant.\nAdvanced Mass Burn High energy efficiency is desired for WTE plants to reap its economic benefits. However, there is a need to balance the benefits of additional energy generated against the higher costs incurred in the operation and maintenance of the plant. For example, corrosion protection is of key concern for plant operating on high steam temperature and pressure to increase its energy efficiency. The expense of installing infrastructure for sustaining heat/high pressure steam needs to be justified against the desired capital cost as well as operating and maintenance costs. 33 6.0 SUPPORTING POLICY AND NON-POLICY MEASURES TO REALISE THE WASTE TECH ROADMAP More integration of the value chain may help to provide greater resilience within Singapore’s economy that is heavily dependent on imports. The OECD programme on sustainable materials management cautions that the successful introduction of policies requires support that cut across several policy fields. 2 Government departments such as environment, energy, climate, innovation and economics need to work together on inculcating resource efficiency. 6.1 Public Education and Policy on Separation of Dry Recyclables and Mixed Waste at Source The NRP is a voluntary-based programme for collection of dry commingled recyclables. The NRP needs to be strengthened with public education and promotion activities to improve the recycling rate. Proper source segregation is the most effective means to resolve feedstock contamination problem and reduce pre-processing steps (e.g. drying and sorting) regardless of them being send to MRF, MBT, or for upcycling. This also reduces energy and labour (operational) costs. Communication and public education on the benefits and importance of source segregation of food waste also need to be encouraged. 6.2 Detailed Waste Composition Study It is recommended that a detailed waste composition study be conducted as a starting point for the design of a customised advanced MRF that suits Singapore context. This includes the potentials for recovering different types of recyclables such as PET, PE, PP, PVC, newspaper, cardboard, glass, organics, residue etc. This can be done either via waste collection contracts awarded to the PWCs or consulting firms with relevant experience. Such a study can be conducted every five years to capture changes in the waste streams and modifications to the MRF processes may be required to accommodate the changes. 6.3 Consultation with Technology Providers and Baseline Studies For alternative technologies, preliminary consultation with technology providers that are based overseas is recommended to understand the feasibility and their applicability in Singapore context. Baseline studies can be carried out for new technologies which are still in pilot scale stage to identify their advantages over existing technologies. The studies also facilitate the identification of tailor-made technological solutions for Singapore to meet its desired goals. 2OECD: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. 2012. Sustainable Materials Management. Green Growth Policy Brief. Brussels: OECD Environment Directorate. Available online at http://www.oecd.org/env/waste/SMM%20synthesis%20-%20policy%20brief_final%20GG.pdf 34 6.4 Regulations and Standards for Implementation of Advanced Technologies Relevant regulations and standards have to be formulated to facilitate and regulate the implementation of technologies such as the use of autonomous waste collection trucks on roads, utilisation of IBA and slag. Pilot scale and demonstration scale projects shall be carried out before the adoption of new technologies.\n6.4.1 Standards for gasification slag There are no local regulations on the use of slag from slagging gasification process. Hence, the study on the unknown long-term effects and product quality will be required to support the offtake of slag from the MSW slagging gasification plants if they are to be built. 6.4.2 Regulation on autonomous vehicles The regulations for the post-testing deployment of autonomous vehicles are under development in the US. The manufacturers must meet these regulations and certify that their autonomous vehicle has been successfully tested to meet safety requirements, and is operationally ready to run on public roads. Further to this, it is also important to engage and consult the public in setting the regulations for autonomous vehicles from the viewpoint of public safety. 35 7.0 WASTE MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY ROADMAP FOR SINGAPORE The Waste Management Technology Roadmap establishes the RDD&D pathways to achieve the 2030 vision. The roadmap address the technology options for collection, sorting, recycling and treatment and recommends solutions to meet the desired goals. It is recommended that the roadmap is to be reviewed and adjusted to technology advancement, changes in policies, waste conditions and public expectations. ERROR! UNKNOWN DOCUMENT PROPERTY NAME.

No. 35 Figure 10: Proposed Technology Roadmap on Waste Management Figure 10: Proposed Technology Roadmap on Waste Management 36 APPENDIX A – VARIOUS MBT CONFIGURATIONS MBT A – Mechanical separation with production of SRF This process requires a mechanical sorting facility. After the waste has undergone size reduction, screening, magnetic separation, and density separation at the mechanical sorting facility, the waste is further processed through aerobic drying, crushing and pelletising into SRF. In order to reduce the water content, the refuse is dried to approximately a 10% moisture level in a dryer. Coarse incombustibles are rejected in the air separator, crushed again and then formed into a pellet by pelletising machine. A typical process flow diagram is presented as below: Figure 11: Typical MBT A Process Flow Diagram The SRF produced from this process is suitable for a wide range of applications, including substituting fossil fuel for power generation and cement production where SRF can offsite a portion of other fuels such as coal, oil or natural gas. Based on the waste composition study carried out by Golder for a client, the gross calorific value or Higher Heating Value (HHV) of SRF materials such as mixed paper, plastics, textiles, wood, food waste and other organics on a ground and dried basis can range from 4,145 kcal/kg to 6,548 kcal/kg. MBT B – Waste to biogas and fertiliser via AD In this process, organic materials such as food scraps and yard debris are tipped into an enclosed receiving area. Operators then use front loaders to mix and stack the waste materials into tunnels called hydrolysis percolators. Inside the hydrolysis percolators, the doors are shut tight to create a gas-tight anaerobic environment. This is the first stage of the AD process. Liquid is then percolated through the materials, biochemically degrading the carbohydrates, fats and proteins into hydrolysate. The hydrolysate is then pumped into methane digesters where biogas is produced through naturally occurring methanogenic bacteria consuming the organic content of the hydrolysate. After two weeks in the hydrolysis percolators, the digestate is removed and composted. Below is a process flow diagram: 37 Figure 12: MBT B Process Flow Diagram This process also recovers biogas which can be used to fuel generators to produce electricity, or upgraded to CNG for injection into a natural gas pipeline, or used to fuel vehicles.\nMBT C – Waste to biofuel and renewable energy via gasification and fermentation This process employs gasification to convert biomass to syngas followed by fermentation to bioethanol. Bioethanol is a renewable fuel and it has less GHG emissions compared to petrol. During the gasification stage, the prepared organic carbon material is gasified using a controlled amount of oxygen to produce syngas, a mixture of principally carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The hot syngas is then quenched and cleaned and the heat is recovered to generate power for use in the process. The cleaned cooled syngas is passed into a fermentation process, where it is converted into ethanol by naturally occurring anaerobic bacteria (the biocatalyst). The fermentation environment, containing the right quantity and type of nutrients, is maintained at controlled conditions. The off-gas from the fermenter can be used to generate additional power and heat. The ethanol solution is then purified and refined to make anhydrous bioethanol (>99.7% ethanol). This can be blended into gasoline as required for the local road transport fuel market.\nThe process flow diagram is presented below.\nFigure 13: MBT C Process Flow Diagram 38 Disclaimer, Limitation of Liability This report represents the personal opinions of the contributor.

Singapore is a small island city-state with a large population, warm climate and high humidity. Over the past two to three decades, rapid industrialization and economic development have caused a tremendous increase in solid waste generation. The yearly disposed solid waste increased from 0.74 million tonnes in 1972 to 2.80 million tonnes in 2000. Solid waste management in Singapore has traditionally been undertaken by the Ministry of Environment (ENV), with the participation of some private sectors in recent years. The hierarchy of solid waste management in Singapore is waste minimization (reduce, reuse and recycle or so-called 3 Rs), followed by incineration and landfill. As land is extremely scarce and only one newly constructed offshore landfill site is available, solid waste incineration has been identified as the most preferred disposal method. Waste minimization, the utilization of incineration ashes, industrial waste management are regarded to be the major challenges in the future.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nSimilar articles\n\n\nA comparison of municipal solid waste management in Berlin and Singapore.\nZhang D, Keat TS, Gersberg RM.

The relevance of WCRP is rising due to its increased waste generation\nand all the challenges involved in its efficient disposal. This resear ch provides a mini -review of the latest approaches and\nits application in the collection and routing of waste. Several metaheuristic algorithms are reviewed, such as ant colony\noptimization, simulated annealing, genetic algorithm, large neighborhood search , greedy randomized adaptive search\nprocedures, and others. Some other approaches to solve WCRP like GIS is also introduced. Finally, a performance\ncomparison of a real -world benchmark is presented as well as future research opportunities in WCRP field.\nKeywords :Waste collection routing problem, metaheuristic, optimization, vehicle routing problem, solid waste,\ngeographic informa tion system\nCorresponding author:\n\nYun -Chia Liang ycliang@saturn.yzu.edu.tw .\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe waste collection and management \npractices vary from one country to another but were \nbroadly categorized as a fixed station or house -to -\nhouse collection by Shekdar (2009). China uses \nfixed station waste collection, with each resident \ndisposing of their waste at specific dump sites, \nfrom where the waste will be trucked to treatment \nfacilities, after which the treated waste is \ntransporte d to disposal sites (Mian et al., 2017). In \ncontrast, in Taiwan fleets of garbage trucks ply \ndaily (and nightly) fixed routes for curbside pickup \nat scheduled stops (Houng et al., 2014). Similarly \nto Taiwan, India conducts house -to -house \ncollection on fixe d sched ules, with trucks \nsummoning residents out to drop off points by \nplaying distinctive music (Joseph, 2014). \nWaste management not only focuses on waste \ncollection or waste routing, but it also includes a \nprocess of generation, col lection, transportat ion, \ntreatment, value recovery, and subse quent disposal \nof waste (Sulemana et al., 2018). Improper waste \nmanagement, such as inefficient transportation or \nrout ing processes, will result in higher costs. \nGrowing global pop ulations and increased \nhousehold waste have increased the government \nand researcher interest in the waste collection and \nrouting problem and multiple models have been \nproposed to optimize the problem. These models, \nnamely waste collection routing problems \n(WCRPs), are an extension of veh icle rout ing \nproblems (VRP). The WCRP can be defined as a \nrouting vehicles to collect waste from a certain \ngroup of nodes and to unload such materials at \ndetermined disposal areas. Just like VRP, in WCRP \nvehicles have fixed capacities and are some times \nsubject to maximum tour durations. Furthermore, \nWCRP considers the same objectives as VRP, \nnamely minimizing total traveling distance or \ntraveling time, minimizing the num ber of vehicles \nrequired, minimizing the waste container fill rate, \netc. The differ ence resides in the fact that, in \nWCRP, multiple visits to disposal sites are allowed \nfor all vehicles and, before returning to the depot, \nvehicles must dispose of all collected waste \n(Buhrkal et al., 2012). \nSimilarly to VRP, WCRP has different \nvariations based on the type of waste to be \ncollected, for example, residential waste (usu ally \nproduced in suburban areas), commercial waste \n(usually generated by restaurants, shopping malls, \nand other commercial establishments), and \nindustrial waste (produced by co nstruction sites, \nlarge shopping malls, or downtown areas; Golden \net al., 2001). There are also variations in WCRP \nbased on the type of 2 Waste Management & Research 00(0) \nconstraints considered, such as WCRP with time windows (Campos and Arroyo, 2017; Sackmann et  al., 2017), time-dependent WCRP (Mat et  al., 2018b), WCRP with lunch-break and driver rest period constraint (Kim et  al., 2006), WCRP with different fleet types (Hauge et  al., 2014), and WCRP with a fixed dumpsite or with multiple dumpsites (Sackmann et  al., 2017), in which, after giving service, the vehicle is not required to return to the depot from where it departed. Another variation is time-dependent WCRP (Mat et  al., 2018b), in which real-world time constraints may imply different traveling speeds due to time-dependent traffic conditions. When time win-dows constraints are taken into consideration, nodes (customers) can only be visited in a certain period or interval, defined by spe-cific opening and closing hours. Another variant proposed by Kim et  al. (2006) considers driver lunch breaks and rest periods. A previous survey paper by Beliën et  al. (2012) summarized and categorized existing publications in the solid waste collec-tion into several categories based on the type of waste, solution method (mathematical programing, heuristics, branch and bound, simulation, and others), type of constraints considered, and research objective. A more recent study by Han and Ponce-Cueto (2015) reviewed different approaches and techniques (classical heuristic and metaheuristic approaches) to solve the solid waste collection problem from 1974 to 2014. Sulemana et  al. (2018) surveyed the application of mathematical pro-graming and geographic information systems (GIS) on solid waste collection. This paper differs from the previously published studies by: (a)  Presenting a survey on studies published between January 2014 and January 2020 that used either heuris-tics or a combination of heuristics with GIS to solve WCRP cases. (b)  Categorization of the recent studies based on their objec-tive function, vehicle type, type of constraint, and the heu-ristic algorithm used to solve their respective problems. (c)  Introduction of future research ideas that can be used to solve WCRP problems. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section “Methodology” explains the research process, while section “Literature Review and WCRP Model Classification” presents a literature review and discusses the WCRP model classification. Conclusions and future research ideas are provided in Section “Conclusions and Future Research.” \nMethodology\nThis section provides a detailed explanation of the methodology used in this research, including an explanation of how papers were extracted, classified, and summarized. As we can observe from Figure 1, there is an increasing num-ber of papers applying heuristic optimization algorithms and heu-ristic  + ArcGIS to solve WCRP due to its difficulty (i.e. an NP-hard problem) and importance of handling waste in growing cities around the world. This paper reviewed a total of 35 journal articles on WCRP published from January 2014 to January 2020 (29 of which applied heuristic approaches, 3 utilized a combination of GIS and heuristic algorithms, and the remaining 3 applied GIS; see Figure 1). Our main concern focuses on those studies that are available in search-able databases, such as Springer, Wiley, Scopus, Emerald, and Web of Science. The articles were extracted using a list of specific key-words together with an additional search criterion (see Table 1). The reviewed articles were retrieved from 27 journals. Multiple papers were found in 3 of 27 journals including Expert Systems with Applications, Waste Management, and Waste Management & Research. The journal with the largest number of publications in this topic is Waste Management & Research. The journal resources are detailed (in alphabetic order) in Table 2. The citation distribution shown in Figure 2 indicates the five most-cited WCRP articles are as follows: \n•• Beltrami and Bodin (1974) were the first researchers who applied VRP to find the efficient routing of the waste collec-tion problem in New York with the main objective to mini-mize the total number of vehicles required. \n•• Lacomme et  al.

As previously mentioned, WCRP is an extension of VRP, where there is a single depot, a set of homogeneous or heterogeneous vehicles, a defined service time, multiple dump sites, and a set of customers that are represented by nodes with known locations. The main constraints are vehicle capacity and route capacity. Once the total waste collected by a vehicle reaches its maximum capacity, it must immediately travel to the disposal site. Route capacity determines the total amount of waste that can be col-lected by a given route or the maximum number of trips a driver can make before returning to the depot after disposing of the waste collected. These constraints indicate that two or more vehi-cles may be required to provide service to a single customer. The main objectives of classical WCRP are: \n•• Minimizing the total number of vehicles or routes. \n•• Minimizing the total cost (i.e. total travel distance or total travel time). In general, the waste collection problem is formulated in two different ways based on the type of urban environment, namely an “arc-problem” and a “node-problem” (Gómez et  al., 2015). When formulated as an arc-problem, waste is accumulated along the street (urban network) and the vehicle must visit the street to per-form the collection, for example, capacitated arc routing problem (CARP) and its variants. When formulated as a node-problem, the waste is accumulated at neighborhood dump sites, usually in rural areas and the vehicle performs collection in such designated loca-tions, for example, capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP). Table 3 provides a summary of each research contribution espe-cially in their proposed approaches to real-world as well as the documented improvement. The waste collection solutions with heuristic optimization approaches are summarized in Table 3 and categorized based on additional constraints, objective function, algorithm, and vehicle type. The heuristic optimization approaches for the waste collection problem and its variations are summarized in Table 4. Table 5 summarizes the performance results of applying multiple heuristic algorithms to solve the WCRP with time win-dows using the benchmark developed by Kim et  al. (2006). 4 Waste Management & Research 00(0) \nThe description of the contents of Tables 3 to 5 is detailed in sub-sections “Waste Collection Routing Problem” through “Waste Collection Arc Routing Problem.” Table 6 shows that Campos and Arroyo (2017) obtained the best results in both objectives (minimizing both the total distance and number of vehicles) with an average total distance of 790.79  miles and an average of 9.4 vehicles. The second best methods were those proposed by Buhrkal et  al. (2012) and Gruler et  al. (2018), both of which obtained a better result either in total distance objective or number of vehicles. \nWaste collection routing problem\nWhile WCRP model has been used to solve the waste collection problem by Hauge et  al. (2014), Rabanni et  al. (2016), Son (2014), Xue and Cao (2016), and the extension Waste collection vehicle routing problem (WCVRP) has been widely implemented to solve real-case studies on the same field. Hauge et  al. (2014) applied Tabu Search (TS) based on the column generation heuristic (Hybrid CG heuristic) to solve roll-on-roll-off routing (ROROR) for industrial waste collection. In ROROR, a homogeneous vehicle fleet will collect waste using different types of containers (vehicle sizes are the same yet the size of the containers varies). Each vehicle can carry up to eight containers at the same time. In ROROR, each vehicle will depart from the depot to collect the waste (container) from a subset of customers when the container level reaches a certain level for delivery to dumpsites, while other vehicles deliver an empty replacement container to each customer. To validate the proposed method, the proposed method was tested on nine datasets, four of which are taken from real-world data and the results are com-pared to the result obtained from a commercial solver (i.e. one built purely by applying heuristics). The results obtained showed that Hybrid CG Heuristic outperformed the results obtained from the commercial solver by reducing the objective function between 8% and 22% with a time limit of 1  hour. Besides, this method outperformed the commercial solver by reducing the objective function between 11% and 27% with a time limit of 5  minutes. Son (2014) proposed solving WCRP through a combination of Chaotic Particle Swarm Optimization (CPSO)—a combination of extended PSO and Arc-GIS. The author starts by obtaining the shortest route (only focusing on minimizing distance, without considering other constraints) using Arc-GIS software. Subsequently, CPSO is used to determine the optimal solution,  \n\nFigure 2. Citation distribution.\n\nLiang et al.  5\nTable 3.  Implementation of heuristic algorithms to real-world WCRP.

The proposed method was applied to maximize the total collected municipal solid waste from a real dataset in Danang, Vietnam and the obtained result showed an improvement in total collected waste (10,933,537  kg) when com-pared to the current practice (10,166,382  kg) but required longer travel distance and higher operational time: 3436  km and 7.5  hours against 2958  km and 6.3  hours. This trade-off between objectives must be further justified since the improvement in total collected waste is only 7.5%; however, there is an increment in both trave-ling distance (16.15%) and traveling time (19.04%). Rabanni et  al. (2016) proposed a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) to solve WCRP developing a new mathematical model that considers different vehicle capacities with multiple separated compartments, deterministic traveling times, and customer demands to minimize the total cost while serving all customers. Two different approaches were developed: HGA1 and HGA2. While HGA1 uses randomized heuristic, HGA2 uses nearest neighborhood heuristic for scheduling customers. The results obtained showed that HGA1 outperforms HGA2 while both HGA1 and HGA2 outperform the solution obtained from apply-ing GA despite having shorter computational (all were tested using identical hardware and software specifications, and coded in MATLAB). In terms of the objective function, both HSA1 and HSA2 outperform GA. HSA1 outperforms GA by 7%–16% while HSA2 outperforms GA by 17%–24%. On the other hand, comparing two algorithms based on its computational time is unfair since HGA1 and HGA2 are improvements of GA which has lower algorithm complexity. Xue and Cao (2016) used the concept of Pareto Front optimality to propose an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to solve a real-world solid waste collection problem in Singapore with multi-ple objectives including minimizing total travel time, accident rates, and population exposure. Total travel time was obtained by calcu-lating the travel time between nodes. The accident rate is defined after determining whether the route includes roads with high acci-dent risk. Finally, population exposure is based on the matrix of pixels that represents the residential and commercial areas with the objective function of minimizing the number of pixels. \nWaste collection vehicle routing problem\nWCVRP is an application of VRP to the waste collection and rout-ing problem.

On the other hand, the similarity between these two variations is that a vehicle must trans-port the waste to the disposal sites before returning to the depot. WCVRP has been successfully applied to solve real-world problems. This section provides a brief review of VRP applications to solve waste collection problem. TS was applied by Gómez et  al. (2015) to solve a bi-objective waste collection problem which not only minimizes the transportation cost but also maximizes the ser-vice level. Four local search operators were used in the improve-ment process, namely Or-exchange, Generalized Or-exchange for inter-route neighborhood improvement, CROSS, and Insertion operators for intra-route neighborhood improvement. The pro-posed method was tested in 4 real-world instances, 20 artificial instances (generated using the same parameters as the real instances), and 4 combination instances. The results show that the proposed TS method using the Multiobjective Adaptive Memory Programing (MOAMP) framework outperforms the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) in both real and artificial instances as well as the current route proposed by the local authorities. Both algorithms were executed under identical computer specifications. From the results, it was observed that MOAMP outperformed NSGA-II in both objective functions by 13.96% and 43.61% (on average from four problem sizes). Farrokhi-Asl et  al. (2017) proposed the NSGA-II and multiple objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) to solve the waste collection problem. The performance of the proposed algo-rithms was compared using the quantity of non-dominated solu-tions generated by each algorithm, while the spacing matrix was used to evaluate whether the solutions were uniformly distributed or not. The performance was evaluated using 10 different test types. The results show that, in terms of quantity of non-domi-nated solutions and diversification matrix, NSGA-II outperforms MOPSO by 54.08% and 12.03%, respectively. Spacing matrix one indicates that NSGA-II is more uniformly distributed in terms of non-dominated solutions. Furthermore, it can be con-cluded that NSGA-II outperforms MOPSO in all three perfor-mance measurements. Assaf and Saleh (2017) applied a genetic algorithm (GA) to solve the waste collection problem, seeking to minimize the total distance traveled by all vehicles in Southern Nablus, Palestine. The nearest neighbor algorithm was applied to build initial solu-tions. The final results show a large reduction in total traveling distance when compared to current practice. The travel distance of truck one was reduced from 182  km (average traveling dis-tance in current practice) to 45.6  km, while truck two reduced from 131–59.14  km, producing an average reduction of 66.42% by applying GA. Hannan et  al. (2017) suggested applying Particle Swarm Optimization to solve Capacitated WCVRP to minimize total costs. The authors assumpt that all vehicles and bins are homoge-neous. The solution quality is improved by applying a 2-opt local search operator for both inter-route and intra-route improvement. In order to validate its performance, the proposed algorithm was compared to the results obtained by previous studies that solved the same problem, such as Wang et  al. (2004) who proposed applying GA, Chen et  al. (2006) who applied a combination of Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization and Simulated Annealing (SA), Kuo et  al. (2012) who used hybrid PSO and GA, and Akhtar et  al. (2017) who applied the backtracking search algo-rithm (BSA) in the same benchmark instances. The proposed method obtained optimal results in four out of six datasets (small problem dataset), while Wang et  al. (2004) obtained one, Chen et  al. (2006) obtained three, and Akhtar et  al. (2017) obtained two. In general, the proposed algorithm outperforms other approaches in small instances, while in large instances there are gaps of 1.25% and 1.46% compared to Chen et  al. (2006) whose solution is still the best. An iterated local search (ILS) algorithm was proposed by Campos and Arroyo (2017) to solve WCVRP with time windows (WCVRPTW). The initial solution was constructed using a greedy algorithm by assigning a vehicle to the closest customer with the least waiting time. The solution is then improved by applying the variable neighborhood descent (VND) algorithm. WCVPR bench-mark instances from Kim et  al. (2006) were chosen to test the per-formance of the proposed method. The solutions were compared to those obtained after applying Variable Neighborhood Tabu Search (VNTS) and it showed that ILS-VND outperformed VNTS in terms of average total cost by 5.97% and average CPU time by 99.97%. On the other hand, when tested on the small instances, ILS-VND obtained average CPU time of 0.01  seconds and the average total cost of 73.33, while in CPLEX the average CPU time is 1472  seconds and the average total cost is 66.41. It can be con-cluded that the proposed ILS-VND algorithm is competitive even though the total cost gap to the CPLEX solver is 10.42% but the improvement in computational time is tremendous. A variant of waste collection, namely WCVRPTW with mul-tiple dumping sites was solved by Sackmann et  al. (2017) by applying the cluster first route second heuristic approach that consists of a K-means algorithm and an extended saving heuris-tic. The K-means algorithm was applied to the clustering process and extended savings was used for the routing process. Saving heuristic including waiting time (algorithm 1) and saving heuris-tic without waiting time (algorithm 2) were applied to a real-world dataset. In terms of vehicle numbers, algorithm 1 obtained 15 vehicles (total average of 5  days) and algorithm 2 obtained 16.2 vehicles while current practice required 13 vehicles on average. In terms of total time (secondary objective), algorithm 1 obtained 347.82  units of time (total for 5  days) and algorithm 2 obtained 347.39 unit of time (total for 5  days). Generally, by tak-ing total time as a secondary objective, both algorithms perform the same. However, while taking total vehicles as the primary objective, algorithm 1 outperforms algorithm 2. Therefore, it can be concluded that algorithm 1 that considers both waiting time and time windows outperforms algorithm 2, but fails to improve the current practice. Modified BSA was applied by Akhtar et  al. (2017) to solve CVRP for the waste collection problem to minimize total col-lected route waste. The only difference between the original BSA proposed by Civicioglu (2013) and this modified version is that both mutation and crossover were applied in each iteration Liang et al.  9\nto produce the trial population. In the improvement stage, four local search operators (two intra-route improvements and two inter-route improvements) were applied. A total of six bench-mark instances were used and the performances between the proposed BSA and the original BSA were compared. The results showed that the proposed algorithm outperformed the original BSA in five out of the six benchmark instances. The collection efficiency was improved by 36.78% and the total distance was reduced by 36.80%. Elgarej et  al. (2017) proposed a multi-agent ant colony sys-tem (ACS) algorithm to minimize total travel distance in the waste collection problem while taking into consideration dif-ferent vehicle capacities (heterogeneous fleet). The proposed ACS method was compared to GA. Both algorithms were tested using benchmark instances which range from 14 to 34 nodes, with identical computer specifications and programing language. The results showed that ACS outperformed GA in four out of five instances in terms of average objective func-tion. Furthermore, the proposed method outperformed GA by 5.23% with no significant difference in processing times between both algorithms. Despite obtaining better results by implementing ACS, it is difficult to determine if such proposed method produces any improvement since there are no compari-sons of such proposed method against the best-known solution so far from the benchmark instances. Mat et  al. (2018a) applied nearest greedy (NG), further from depot (FFD), different initial customer (DIC), Saving Approach, Sweep Algorithm, and DIC based on the Sweep Algorithm to solve a case study in Malaysia. The results showed that travel distance was reduced by 12% by applying DIC when compared to current practice. A study from Mat et  al. (2018b) applied current initial solution (CIS) and DIC to solve WCVRP. The proposed algorithms were applied to solve the benchmark instances from Kim et  al. (2006) with the objective to minimize total travel distance. The study was conducted using both static and dynamic speeds for both DIC and CIS approaches. DIC with dynamic speed outperformed DIC with static speeds and CIS with static or dynamic speeds. This approach reduced the number of vehicles by 2, total travel distance by 7.85%, and total travel time by 19.1%. Randomized saved based heuristic was proposed by Gruler et  al. (2018) to solve WCVRP in a homogeneous fleet, which means that the collection route is served by a single-vehicle. The benchmark instances used to test the algorithm performance were introduced by Kim et  al. (2006). The solution obtained was com-pared to previous studies from Benjamin and Beasley (2010) and Buhrkal et  al. (2012), since it not only considers the same bench-mark instances but also the same objective functions. The pro-posed algorithm obtained better results in four out of ten problems with a gap range from −9.1% to 11.3%. On average, the gap of the proposed method to the best solution was −1.2% which is considered comparable. An efficient SA algorithm was developed by Tirkolaee et  al. (2019a) to build the initial solution in WCVRP. The algorithm initialized a route by choosing a random vehicle from the depot. Subsequently, a node with both least distance from the depot and shortest waiting time is assigned to the route. The next node is assigned as long as none of the vehicle constraints is exceeded; oth-erwise, the vehicle is sent to the disposal site. This methodology is repeated until all of the nodes are assigned to the routes. Time and total cost of routes for all of the heterogenous vehicles are assumed to be the same and multiple trips for each vehicle are also consid-ered. The proposed algorithm was tested and compared to the results obtained by CPLEX and the best historical solution. The proposed algorithm was able to reduce the total cost by 13.3% when compared to current practice and anywhere from 0.38% to 2.08% when compared to the results obtained by the CPLEX solver. Moreover, the proposed algorithm showed much shorter computa-tional time compared to the time obtained by the CPLEX solver. A bi-objective solution in the waste collection was proposed by Delgado-Antequera et  al. (2019) with path relinking and Pareto Front to evaluate the performance in each iteration. Two greedy insertions were developed in the construction phase, while in the optimization phase multiple local search operators were applied to improve the solution by minimizing travel cost and balancing the routes. Six different parameter settings for Path Relinking (named D1PR-D6PR) were proposed and was tested in benchmark instances from real-world conditions in rural south-ern Spain. Both the D5-PR and D6-PR approaches outperformed the alternatives. The authors claim that the proposed method improved both travel distances and longest travel route, but the authors fail to cite travel distance and longest travel route based on current practice and a straight comparison is difficult due to changes to the collection procedure. Aliahmadi et  al. (2020) applied fuzzy optimization and GA using a one-point crossover and swap mutation operator to obtain an initial solution for solid waste collection in Tehran, Iran, seek-ing to minimize fixed costs (vehicles) and variable costs (travel distance), in waste collection with multiple depots and multiple intermediate facilities. The efficiency of the proposed method was evaluated by applying it to real-world conditions in Tehran. Results show that the proposed method decreases total cost from 1,054,884.37 IRR (Iranian rial) to 956,733.125 IRR, despite each vehicle serving an area 9.3% smaller than current practice. Delgado-Antequera et  al. (2020) proposed an Iterated Greedy algorithm combined with variable neighborhood search (VNS) to minimize total travel distance, number of routes, and route bal-ancing. The proposed method was shown to outperform both non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) and Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 (SPEA2). When implemented to solve real-world problems, the proposed method improved the objective function by 115.02% in terms of travel distance f1 and by 375.45% in terms of the number of routes or f2.Finally, f3 indicated that the route balance was improved from 26,004.06 to 352.54. \nBenchmark instances in WCVRP.  Other studies have tested model performance using benchmarks before applying WCVRP 10  Waste Management & Research 00(0) \nto solve real-world cases. Sahoo et  al. (2005) used the benchmark instances proposed by Solomon (1987), despite them being designed as VRPTW benchmark instances since no other instances were available at that time to test the WCVRP algo-rithm. The dataset is composed of six different problem types— R1, R2, C1, C2, RC1, and RC2—with 100 customers each. In problems R1 and R2, customers are randomly generated, while customers are clustered in problems C1 and C2. RC1 and RC2 generate customers randomly or in clusters. R1, C1, and RC1 have smaller vehicle capacities (=200) than R2 (capacity of 1000), C2 (capacity of 700), and RC2 (capacity of 1000). The 56 instances are unevenly distributed over 6 problem types includ-ing 12 instances for R1, 11 instances for R2, 9 instances for C1, and 8 instances each for RC1, RC2, and C2 (Solomon, 2005). \nWCVRP with time windows and lunch break time.  WCVRPTW constraint is among the most applicable to real-world problems models. The addition of the time windows constraint signifies that the opening and closing times to provide service to a node or a customer have to be taken into consideration. A vehicle can start providing service to a customer at any moment between their opening and closing times. Furthermore, if a vehicle arrives before a node has opened, a waiting time has to be added to the total traveling time. If a vehicle arrives after a node’s closing time, a different vehicle needs to be assigned to serve the node. Lunch breaks are usually determined to be 1-hour intervals between 11:00  a.m. and 12:00  p.m. or 12:00  p.m. to 1:00  p.m. with a service time of 60  minutes. After the lunch period, the travel dis-tance remains unchanged but travel time now includes the lunch break. WCVRPTW with lunch break period is presented as a net-work G = (V, A), a subset of nodes represented by node 1 to node N,disposal sites represented by node N + 1 to N + M and the lunch break period denoted by N + M + 1. Finally, the depot is repre-sented by 0 in the vertex set of V = {0, 1, 2,.  . ., N, N + 1,.  . .\nN + M + 1} and A represents the set of arcs. [ E, L ] represents the depot time windows for the earliest possible visit time and latest possible visit time. The set of vehicles is represented by K, Nk is the actual number of disposal trips for vehicle k and C is the vehicle capacity. Xijk is the decision variable, equal to 1 if vehicle k visits arc (i, j ) for ( i, j ) ∈ A and k ∈ K, otherwise 0. Time variable wik is the start time at node i if it serviced by vehicle k. Finally, Dik is the cumulative demand for vehicle k at node i. The mathematical model of WCVRPTW with lunch break also known as Waste-VRPTW with a lunch break, adapted from Sahoo et  al. (2005) as follows: Objective Function Minimize  k K i j Ai j i j k t x \n\n∈\n\n( )∈ ∑ ∑ ,, , , \nSubject to   \n\nkK i j Ai j k\n\nx i N \n\n∈\n\n( )∈ ∑ ∑ = ∀ ∈ …  \n\n,,,\n\n, , ,1 1 2  (1) \n\njNj k\n\nx k K\n\n=\n\n∑ = ∀ ∈\n\n10\n\n1, , , (2) \nD C k K i N N Mi k , , , , , , ,≤ ∀ ∈ ∈ … + +1 2 1 (3) \nD k K m N N N Mm k , , , , , , ,= ∀ ∈ ∈ + + … +0 0 1 2 (4) \nD d D x Big M k Ki N M ji k j j k i j k , , , , ,, , , , , , , , ,\n\n− ≤ −( ) ∀ ∈∈ … + + ∈ …\n\n10 1 2 1 0 1 2 NN N M, ,+ +1\n(5)   \n\njNjiNMi j k k\n\nd x C N k K  \n\n==++\n\n∑ ∑ ≤ ∀ ∈\n\n111,,*\n\n, (6)       \n\niN N MmNNMi m k k\n\nx N k K    \n\n∈ … ++=++\n\n∑ ∑ = ∀ ∈\n\n111,,,,,\n\n, (7)       \n\nmNNMiNNMm j k k\n\nx N k K   \n\n=++∈ … ++\n\n∑ ∑ = − ∀ ∈\n\n111\n\n1, , ,, , , , (8)    \n\nmNNMmk\n\nx k K \n\n=++\n\n∑ = ∀ ∈\n\n10\n\n1, , , (9)    \n\niNMi N Mk\n\nx k K \n\n=+++\n\n∑ = ∀ ∈\n\n11\n\n1, , , (10)    \n\njNMNMj k\n\nx k K \n\n=+++\n\n∑ = ∀ ∈\n\n01\n\n1, , , (11)   \n\niNMi j k iNMj i k\n\nx x k K j N M  \n\n=++=++\n\n∑ ∑= ∀ ∈ ∈ … + +\n\n0101\n\n0 1 1, , , , , , , , , (12) \nw s t w x Big M k K i j Ai k i i j j k i j k , , , , , , , ,+ + − ≤ −( ) ∀ ∈ ( )∈ 1 (13) \nw s s t wx x Big M ki k i N M i j j k i N M k N M j k       \n\n,,,,,,,\n\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n−≤ − −( ) ∀ ∈+ ++ + + + \n\n\n\n\n\n\n111\n\n2 KK i j A, , ,( )∈  (14) \na x w bx k K i N MijN Mi j k i k ijN Mi j k   \n\n=++=++\n\n∑∑≤ ≤= ∀ ∈ ∈ … + +\n\n1111\n\n0 1 , , ,, , , , , , 11, \n(15) Liang et al.  11 \nE w L k K i N Mi k ≤ ≤ ∀ ∈ ∈ … + +, , , , , ,0 1 1 (16) \nx k K i j Ai j k , , , , , , ,∈{ } ∀ ∈ ( )∈ 0 1  (17) \nN k Kk ≥ ∀ ∈0, ,Integer  (18) \nD k K i N Mi k , , , , , , ,≥ ∀ ∈ ∈ … + +0 0 1 1 (19) Equation (1) ensures that each node is served by exactly one vehicle, while equation (2) determines that the route will start at the depot. The amount of waste collected should be less than total vehicle capacities is expressed in equation (3) while equation (4) resets the vehicle volume to zero after the vehicle visits the dis-posal site. Equation (5) ensures that the total waste collected increases with the number of served nodes. The number of times a vehicle visits a disposal site is calculated in equation (6). Equation (7) ensures the total number of disposal trips must equal the number of trips made from a regular node to the disposal sites, while the total number of trips made from a disposal site to a regular node must equal the total number of disposal trips minus one, as shown in equation (8). Equation (9) ensures the route ends in the depot, while the lunch break period constraint within a route is verified by equations (10) and (11). Equation (12) guarantees that after visiting a node, a vehicle must travel to the next node. Equations (13), (15), and (16) ensure that both the vehicle and route time constraints are not exceeded. Equation (14) imposes the lunch break time consideration into total travel time. Equation (17) is a binary condition while equations (18) and (19) are integrality constraints. Kim et  al. (2006) proposed widely used open-source bench-mark instances for WCVRPTW. The dataset contains ten differ-ent instances with varying numbers of nodes, disposal sites (also known as landfills), vehicle capacities, time windows (opening and closing times), and service times. The total number of nodes in each instance ranges from 102 to 2100 nodes while the total number of landfills varies from 1 to 19. The maximum number of nodes visited per day is 500 and the number of depots is one. Furthermore, the distance from one node to another can be calcu-lated using Manhattan distance with the location coordinates information provided. A summary of this dataset’s parameters can be found in Table 7. \nSplit-delivery vehicle routing problem (SDVRP).  In SDVRP, after the route has been determined, a vehicle will depart from the depot to pick up the waste from several collection sites and deliver it to the disposal sites before returning to the depot. In this problem, a node can be visited multiple times to receive service, unlike in CVRP where each node must be visited exactly once. Huang and Lin (2015) proposed SDVRP to solve the residential waste collection problem in Taiwan, where the “Trash Doesn’t Touch the Ground” policy requires residents to meet garbage trucks at designated curbside points on a fixed schedule. The time constraint was considered as a time interval in which each node can be served. The objective is to minimize total travel distance and the number of vehicles assigned. The mathematical model for SDVRP with pickup and delivery vari-ables defined as K as the set of collection vehicle, N as the set of collection points, { o, d} be the origin and destination point, \nxi \n\n*\n\nas the optimal collection point i, q if is the amount of waste to be collected for the fth collection of the point i, i  ∈ ∈N f, C,\nZ if kt represent the decision variable whether the fth collection of the point i is assigned to truck k on its tth trip,  yijff kt  \n\n'\n\nis the deci-sion variable, equal to 1 if there is a flow from collection point \ni to j from vehicle k on its tth trip for the fth collection at the point i and f' th collection at point j; otherwise, it will be set to 0.

The main dif-ference between ACVRP and other VRP models is that it consid-ers an asymmetrical distance matrix. For example, the distance from node A to node B is not the same as the distance from node B to node A, just like the travel distance in a city between two locations depends on the street and restrictions. ACVRP can be formulated as a graph G = (V, A) with sets of vertices ( V) and arcs ( A). Vertex 1 can be interpreted as the depot and its demand is fictitious d1 = 0 with identical vehicle k to a served subset of arcs without violating the vehicle capacity Dmax .The remaining vertex j = 2, . . ., n represents a set of customers j.Each arc ( i, j ) ∈ A and i ≠≠  j is associated with negative cost cij \n(cij  = 0 for each i = 1,.  . ., n). In ACVRP, each customer is visited exactly once by a single-vehicle which departs from the depot and cannot exceed the maximum accumulated vehicle capacity constraint Dmax .The combination of greedy randomized adaptive search pro-cedure (GRASP) and VND was applied by López-Sánchez et  al. (2018) to solve the multiobjective waste collection problem in southern Spain to achieve route balancing and to minimize travel distance as well as the total number of vehicles. This approach was applied to solve the benchmark instances introduced by Maniezzo and Roffilli (2008), adapted to reflect authentic condi-tions in Spain. The mathematical model for ACVRP proposed by Mancera-Galván et  al. (2017) can be observed in equations (33) to (40) below. In ACVRP, a graph G = (V, A) consists of a set of nodes \nV = {1,2,.  . ., n} and A = {i,j | i, j ∈ V} represents a set of arcs. Each vehicle K will depart from and return to the depot repre-sented by D = {0} without violating capacity constraint Q. Each node has demand represented by qik for collection by vehicle k.The total q ik cannot exceed Q while c ij is the total travel distance from node i to node j and uik is a sub tour. Lastly, xij and yij are binary decision variables. Equation (33) establishes that the objective function is to min-imize total travel distance: \nMinimize    \n\ni V j V ij kKij k\n\nc x   \n\n∈∈∈\n\n∑∑∑  (33) Each node must be visited exactly once by vehicle k presented in equation (34):\nTable 7.

Marković et  al. (2019) applied the vehicle routing problem with stochastic demand to solve the problem of solid waste collection. Initial solutions were created by applying the Clarke–Wright Saving algorithm and improved using both 2-opt local search as well as the Improved Harmony Search algorithm. The formulated model is different from that proposed by Kim et  al. (2006), which has been widely used for solving solid waste collec-tion and routing problem. The former allows for nodes to be visited exactly once and considers the amount of waste to be stochastic, while the latter allows for more than one visit to a node and consid-ers the amount of waste to be deterministic. The proposed method was compared to the performance of current routes used by the Public Utilities Company (PUC) Mediana-Nǐs and resulted in a 10% reduction in fuel costs and 24.42% reduction in average travel time. The results clearly show that the proposed model can opti-mize the current route considering that the objective function (min-imize traveling distance, represented by the reduction in terms of average traveling time) is satisfied.

Waste collection ARC has been widely adopted to solve the waste collection problem. Hill climbing and TS were proposed by Cortinhal et  al. (2016) to solve WCRP, while testing the algorithm performance on ran-domly generated instances from a residential area with a fixed number of vehicles. The initial solution is built in two stages— sectoring and routing—which is later improved by applying local search operators. Both algorithms were shown to yield an initial solution with an optimal number of connected components when tested with benchmark instances according to current practice. A hybrid adaptive search large neighborhood with whale opti-mization algorithm (ALNS-WOA) was proposed by Mofid-Nakhaee and Barzinpour (2019) to solve homogenous single compartment vehicle (SCV) and multi-compartment vehicle (MCV) with intermediate facilities in WCRP to minimize total cost. The performance of the proposed algorithm was compared to that of adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm (ALNS) and General Algebraic Modeling System software through test-ing with the benchmark instances adapted from Willemse and Joubert (2016). Results show that ALNS-WOA outperforms ALNS in terms of solution quality while the computational time of ALNS-WOA is higher than ALNS. The proposed model was also applied to solve real-case problems from eight districts in Tehran, Iran. Results showed that total cost reduction in both SCV and MCV is 6880 and 43,382, respectively, when compared to the current implementation. Tirkolaee et  al. (2019b) solved the WCRP and minimized total costs by implementing a Max-Min Ant System (MMAS) as well as Improved Max-Min Ant System (IMMAS). The initial solu-tion was built based on the GRASP method known as the Initial Solution Heuristic Algorithm (ISHA). The performance of the proposed method was tested on two groups of benchmark instances (small-medium and large) and compared to the CPLEX solutions. When tested on small-medium sized instances, the average gaps were 4.59%, 1.67%, and 1.11% for ISHA, MMAS, and IMMAS, respectively. On the other hand, the average gaps in large-sized instances were 9.47%, 2.71%, and 0% for ISHA, MMAS, and IMMAS, respectively. These results show that IMMAS outperformed both ISHA and MMAS in both bench-mark instances sizes. A novel invasive weed optimization algorithm was proposed by Tirkolaee et  al. (2019c) to solve a bi-objective multi-trip peri-odic CARP in the waste collection problem. This method mini-mizes the total cost as a first objective and then minimizes the longest tour of all vehicles as a secondary objective. To tackle demand uncertainty, an interval-based uncertainty is considered. The proposed multi-objective invasive weed algorithm (MOIWO) was tested on 10 randomly generated instances with computa-tional time as a termination criterion. The performance of this algorithm was compared against the Pareto front (obtained by applying a ε-constraint method). Results showed that MOIWO’s Means of Ideal Distance (MID) and Number of Solutions (NOS) are both higher than the ε-constraint method while CPU time is lower. Ideally, the smaller MID and the higher NOS will lead to a better solution. However, the ε-constraint method cannot handle large instances (e.g. instance 9 and instance 10). In terms of CPU time and NOS, MOIWO outperformed the ε-constraint method, but in MID the ε-constraint method performs better than MOIWO. Tirkolaee et  al. (2020) extended on their previous work (Tirkolaee et  al. 2019b) which implemented a hybrid aug-mented ant colony optimization (HA-ACO) and a MMAS on an initial solution generated using SA enhanced with Taguchi parameter design method to solve multi-trip WCRP under het-erogeneous fleet and demand uncertainty (fuzzy demand) while minimizing total cost. The proposed model was tested on the randomly generated benchmark instances (adapted from Tirkolaee et  al., 2019b) to validate its performance before implementing it to solve a real case in Tehran, Iran. Compared to CPLEX, HA-ACO and MMAS obtained shorter computa-tional time (CPU time) with average gaps to best fitness of 0.65% and 1.07% on small and medium-sized instances, respectively. When tested on large-sized instances, the average run times of CPLEX, HA-ACO, and IMMAS are 1084.27, 158.37, and 122.10  seconds, respectively. It can be concluded that both of the proposed approaches obtained shorter CPU time compared to CPLEX, with a slightly higher gap (less than 2%) in the objective function. GA was proposed by Nevrlý et  al. (2019) who applied it on two different real-world datasets. The first dataset is a case net-work in Jihlava, Czech Republic with 1467 vertices and 3529 edges while the second dataset consists of 8549 nodes. In the improvement stage, three different local search operators (namely swap, double insertion, and single insertion) were applied. The heuristic approach (66.7  km) reduced total travel distance by 7% when compared to the current practice (71.4  km).

PCARP is an extension of CARP in which the routes are determined for a period of time, differs from CARP or CVRP where the solutions are deter-mined for a single day. Tirkolaee et  al. (2018) proposed PCARP to solve waste collection problems by taking multiple trips, accounting for driver, and crew working time. A hybrid SA with efficient cool-ing equation was proposed to deal with heterogeneous fleets and asymmetric networks. The objective in this problem is to minimize both total traversed distance and usage cost, and the demand in each edge is assumed to fluctuate with a given uncertainty interval. Tirkolaee et  al. (2018) mathematically modeled PCARP as follows: The objective function is to minimize a vehicle’s total trans-versing and usage cost. 16  Waste Management & Research 00(0) \nh f s V S k K t T o Okto skto s\n\n≤ ∀ ⊆ { } ≠ ∀ ∈ ∀ ∈ ∀ ∈1 1, \\ ; ; , ,\n\nφ (78) Decision variables in this model can be observed in equations (79) to (81). \nh f s VS k K t T o Okto skto s\n∈{ } ∈{ } ∀ ⊆ { } ≠ ∀ ∈ ∀ ∈ ∀ ∈\n0 1 0 1 1, , , , \\ ;; , , ,\nφ\n(79) \nx y ui j E k K t T oijkt oijkt okt ∈{ } ∈{ } ∈{ }∀( )∈ ∀ ∈ ∀ ∈ ∀ ∈\n0 1 0 1 0 1 , , , , , ,, , , , OO,\n(80) \nE z r i j E k K t T o Oijkt okto ijkt o\n, , , , , , , .≥ ∀( )∈ ∀ ∈ ∀ ∈ ∀ ∈0 (81) \nMinimize λ        \n\ni j E k K o O t Tij ijkt kK t Tkkt\n\ndis x cv u \n\n,\n\n( )∈ ∈ ∈ ∈ ∈ ∈∑ ∑∑∑ ∑∑ +0 (67) The flow balance constraint enforced by equation (68). \nx x\ni V k K t T o Oijkt oi j E jikt oj i E, ,,, , , ,\n( )∈ ( )∈ ∑ ∑=∀ ∈ ∀ ∈ ∀ ∈ ∀ ∈ (68) Equation (69) establishes that each arc must be served exactly once. \n( ) , , , ,, ,\ny y i j or j i Et T o Oijkt ojikt ok K R+ = ∀( ) ( )∈ ∀ ∈ ∀ ∈∈∑ 1\n(69) Equations (70) to (72) are robustness constraints. \nd y z r Wk K t Tijt i j E ijkt okto kto ijkt oi j E kR R  \n\n,,\n\n,, ,\n( )∈ ( )∈ ∑ ∑+ + ≤∀ ∈ ∀ ∈ Γ∀∀ ∈o O\n(70) \nz r d E k K i j E t T o Okto ijkt o ijt ijkt oR+ ≥ ∀ ∈ ∀( )∈ ∀ ∈ ∀ ∈ , , , , , , (71) \n− ≤ ≤ ∀ ∈ ∀( )∈ ∀ ∈ ∀ ∈E y E k K i j E t T o Oijkt oijkt oijkt oR, , , , , (72) Equation (73) ensures that the transversed vehicle will serve the required edges. \ny x i j E k K t T o Oijkt ojikt o\n≤ ∀( )∈ ∀ ∈ ∀ ∈ ∀ ∈, , , , , (73) Equation (74) represents the constraint cost, the kth vehicle can be used if the usage costs are taken into consideration. \nx Mu k K t Tijkt oo Oi j E kt \n\n∈\n\n( )∈ ∑∑ ≤ ∀ ∈ ∀ ∈  \n\n,\n\n, , , (74) Transversing time is restricted in equation (75) (total trans-versing time should not exceed the budget). \ndis Vel xLw y Tij ijk o O i j E ijkt oijk o O i j E ijkt oma R\n\n∈\n\n( )∈ ∈( )∈ ∑∑∑∑+ ≤  \n\n,,xx\n\nk K t T, ,∀ ∈ ∀ ∈ \n(75) Equations (76) to (78) are the sub-tour elimination constraints. \nx nh s VS k K t T o Oijkt oi j S kto s \n\n,\n\n, \\ ;; , , ,\n\n∈\n\n∑ ≤ + ∀ ⊆ { } ≠ ∀ ∈ ∀ ∈ ∀ ∈\n1 1\nφ\n(76) \nx f s V Sk K t T o Oijkt oj Si S kto s \n\n≠∈\n\n∑∑ ≥ − ∀ ⊆ { } ≠∀ ∈ ∀ ∈ ∀ ∈\n1 1, \\ ; ;, , ,\nφ (77) \nNotation Description \nV Set of nodes \nK Set of vehicles \nE Set of all defined edges \nER Set of mandatory edges \nT Time period \nO Set of possible multiple trips \nS Optional edges defined in the network \ndis ij Traversing distance from edge ( i, j)\nVel ijk Average speed of vehicle k from edge ( i, j)\nLw ijk Waste loading time from vehicle k in edge ( i, j)\ndijt Uncertain demand for edge ( i, j) at time t\nd ijt \n Average uncertain demand for edge ( i, j) at time t\ncv k Usage cost of vehicle kW k Capacity of vehicle kTmax Maximum available time for a vehicle for a route \nα Distance conversion ratio to cost \nM Big number \nx ijkt o\n{0, 1} equal to 1 if edge ( i, j) is visited by vehicle k\non 0 th trip at time t, otherwise equal to 0. \ny ijkt o\n{0, 1} equal to 1 if edge ( i,j ) is serviced by vehicle \nk on 0 th trip at time t; otherwise, equal to 0. \nukt {0, 1} equal to 1 if vehicle k is used at time t,otherwise equal to 0. \nGIS for WCRP\nGIS are often used to address the WCRP aside from metaheuristic or heuristic approaches. GIS can extract customer location infor-mation, such as x, y, and z coordinates from the given address and combine it with authentic environmental information for the sur-rounding location. Planners use GIS to calculate travel distance and time in the waste collection problem since it can consider street-specific constraints, such as one-way streets or turn penalties, which can-not be calculated when using exact methods, including the Euclidean distance or the Manhattan distance formula. Arc-GIS is used to obtain the shortest route for a given time of the day between points on the network. This approach is com-monly used to build the initial solution before implementing Liang et al.  17 \nheuristic approaches. Then, when optimizing with heuristic, additional constraints (i.e. time windows, vehicle capacities, etc.) are taken into consideration. \nGIS  + heuristic algorithm\nA novel heuristic-based smart algorithm was proposed by Louati et  al. (2018a) to solve the waste collection problem using a case study in Sfax, Tunisia. The proposed algorithm mimics the idea of the Dijkstra algorithm to generate the optimal solution. The obtained results outperformed both current practice and ArcGIS with the Dijkstra algorithm. The spatial GIS based on the GA was proposed by Louati et  al. (2018b) to minimize total travel time. Routes were con-structed using ArcGIS to calculate distances and determine the location of nodes. Improvements were obtained by applying an improved Dijkstra method in GIS. GA was applied to determine the best solution in the evolutionary phase. After the best solution was obtained, the routes were plotted on a map using ArcGIS in a Python script. \nGIS application\nMalakahmad (2014) also applied GIS to the waste collection problem. GIS provides a geographical reference when creating, arranging, and analyzing routes. ArcGIS network analysis is an extension of GIS and it helps solve network problems by calcu-lating travel time and distance, locating facilities, and planning routes for the entire fleet (Son, 2014). Kinobe et  al. (2015) used GIS to optimize waste collection in Kampala, Uganda, seeking to maximize total waste collected while minimizing total vehicle numbers and total travel distance. The results increased waste collection per vehicle from 6 to 10  metrics ton, reduced travel distance by 34%, and reduced the number of trips from 82 to 48. Sanjeevi and Shahabudeen (2016) applied ArcGIS in Chennai, India to optimize solid waste collection route distance. Waste from thirteen nodes was transported to intermediate facilities (transfer stations) before being transported to the landfill. The applied method optimized routes while reducing total travel dis-tance by 9.93% and reduced total cost by 226.1 million when compared to current practice. Sulemana et  al. (2019) proposed an ArcGIS network analysis extension to yield optimal routes using data from three local authorities in Ghana. Such approach reduced weekly travel dis-tance by 81.27  km, total number of vehicles by 4.79%, travel time by 853.59  minutes and also provided a significant reduction in fuel consumption. \nConclusions and future research\nGenerally, waste collection and routing can be modeled as WCRP or WCVRP depending on its type of problem. If the collection is from door-to-door it usually will be modeled as WCARP. On the other hand, if the waste collection is from each disposal site then it usually will be modeled as WCVRP. This review paper reviews recent studies on the WCRP, particu-larly solutions using different heuristic algorithms. Several exten-sions and variants of WCRP are also reviewed, such as WCRP with time windows and WCRP with time dependencies constraint. Gruler et  al. (2018) considers driver lunch and break time constraints using the dataset developed by Kim et  al. (2006). Huang and Lin (2015) modeled their problem as a SDVRP in which the vehicle has to col-lect waste from different locations and deliver it to disposal sites. López-Sánchez et  al. (2018) modeled their problem as an ACVRP which considers an asymmetric distance matrix. Marković et  al. (2019) considered stochastic demand as an additional constraint for waste collection, modeling the problem as a CVRPSD. Rather than only performing node routing, the WCRP can also be modeled as an arc-routing problem. Cortinhal et  al. (2016) modeled WCRP as a WCARP. Finally, Tirkolaee et  al. (2018) extended WCARP into a PCARP in which the routes are determined for a period of time. Most WCRP applications seek to solve real case problems in different countries around the world and most papers concluded that such approaches obtained improvements over current prac-tices. The only publicly available dataset, from Kim et  al. (2006), was used in several articles, such as Benjamin and Beasley (2010) who proposed TS and VNS; Buhrkal et  al. (2012) who applied Adaptive LNS Algorithm; Benjamin and Beasley (2013) proposed TS, VNS, and VNTS; and Gruler et  al. (2018) who applied a randomized saved based heuristic. Another challenge in this problem is uncertain waste volumes and potentially inaccurate estimates of waste volumes may lead to routing and scheduling failures, when faced with actual demand spikes. To tackle this problem, Tirkolaee et  al. (2019c) considered interval-based uncertainty by applying a robust opti-mization adapted from previous research. Simplifying the problem requires some assumptions. The first assumption is that vehicles drop their collected waste at a single intermediate facility, when in practice multiple such facilities are normally used. Another assumption is that; we focus only on the process of customers dropping their waste in the intermediate facilities, rather than also analyzing the process of collecting waste from such facilities. Besides, benchmark instances typically assume fleet homogeneity, but in practice, fleets include different vehicles with different carrying capacities. Kim et  al. (2006) pro-posed a benchmark which is the only instance to include driver lunch and break time, thus better approximating actual conditions. \nFuture research\nNumerous articles have proposed extensions of WCRP by apply-ing heuristic algorithms, such as WCRP with time windows or time-dependent WCRP. However, none of the reviewed articles considered both constraints simultaneously while applying heu-ristic algorithms to solve WCRP. Future research should thus consider both constraints. This paper only reviewed solid waste in WCRP, but other types of waste have their particular 18  Waste Management & Research 00(0) \ncharacteristics, including contaminated and hazardous waste, cooking oil waste, household plastic waste, and medical waste. Future work should seek to optimize the collection and disposal of these various types of waste. \nDeclaration of conflicting interests \nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article. \nFunding \nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-ship, and/or publication of this article. \nORCID iD \nYun-Chia Liang  https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0375-0830 \nReferences \nAkhtar M, Hannan MA, Begum RA, et  al.

Singapore is a small island city-state with a large population, warm climate and high humidity. Over the past two to three decades, rapid industrialization and economic development have caused a tremendous increase in solid waste generation. The yearly disposed solid waste increased from 0.74 million tonnes in 1972 to 2.80 million tonnes in 2000. Solid waste management in Singapore has traditionally been undertaken by the Ministry of Environment (ENV), with the participation of some private sectors in recent years. The hierarchy of solid waste management in Singapore is waste minimization (reduce, reuse and recycle or so-called 3 Rs), followed by incineration and landfill. As land is extremely scarce and only one newly constructed offshore landfill site is available, solid waste incineration has been identified as the most preferred disposal method. Waste minimization, the utilization of incineration ashes, industrial waste management are regarded to be the major challenges in the future.\nIntroduction\nThe “Waste Management Hierarchy” (minimization, recovery and transformation, and land disposal) has been adopted by most industrialized nations as the menu for developing solid waste management strategies. The extent to which any one option is used within a given country however varies, largely depending on a number of factors, such as topography, population density, transportation infrastructure, socioeconomic and environmental regulations (Sakai et al., 1996).\nBeing a small and densely populated country with a hot and humid climate (land area of 659.9 km2; population of 3.89 million; average temperature of 24.7∼31.3 °C, daily average humidity at 84.4%, and annual average rainfall of 2134 mm) (Department of Statistics, 2000a), Singapore is potentially vulnerable to the outbreak of any infectious diseases. At the same time, rapid economic and population growth continues to contribute to the burden of solid waste disposal.\nSolid waste management in Singapore has traditionally been undertaken by the Ministry of Environment (ENV). The statute dealing with solid waste management in Singapore is the Environmental Pollution Control Act (EPCA) which came into force on the first of April 1999 and is a consolidation of existing legislations on the control of air, water and waste, including the Environmental Public Health Act (EPHA) and the regulations passed under EPHA, such as:\n\n\n•\nEnvironmental Public Health (Public Cleansing) Regulations;\n\n\n•\nEnvironmental Public Health (Toxic Industrial Waste) Regulations;\n\n\n•\nEnvironmental Public Health (General Waste Collection) Regulations;\n\n\n•\nEnvironmental Public Health (Corrective Work Order) Regulations.\n\n\nUnder the EPHA, “waste” is defined as “any substance or article which requires to be disposed of as being broken, worn out, contaminated or otherwise spoiled, and for the purpose of this Act anything which is discarded or otherwise dealt with as if it were waste shall be presumed to be waste unless the contrary is proved…” (Ooi, 1995).\nUnder the Public Cleansing and General Waste Collection Regulations, all generated solid waste has to be collected in Singapore. The Corrective Work Order also serves as a preventive measure for littering (under the Corrective Work Order, people who are caught littering may be fined and/or required to clean a public place, for example, picking up litter along public roads, in public parks or housing estates). Because of the very limited landfill capacity for waste disposal and the need to conserve this limited capacity for the future, landfilling of solid waste in Singapore has been opted as the least desirable disposal method. In order to achieve the maximum reduction of waste volume entering the landfill, solid waste incineration, although much more expensive, has been given top priority over all other waste transformation options. In addition, waste minimization at source in all sectors of the community has been promoted for years. This paper discusses the various practices and challenges of solid waste management in Singapore.\nSection snippets\nSolid waste generation and characteristics\nSolid waste in Singapore is broadly classified into three main categories (Low, 1990):\n\n\n•\nDomestic refuse (solid waste generated by households, markets, food centers and commercial premises such as hotels, restaurants, shops, etc.);\n\n\n•\nIndustrial refuse (not including toxic and hazardous waste that requires special handling, treatment and disposal);\n\n\n•\nInstitutional refuse (solid waste from various Government and Statutory Board installations, hospitals, schools, recreational facilities and public\n\n\nSolid waste collection system\nPrior to 1996, waste collection came under the ambit of the Environmental Health Department (EHD) of ENV and the private waste collectors. EHD provided daily collection services to domestic households, trade and institutional premises, while the private waste collectors served mainly industrial premises, commercial buildings, shopping centers, construction sites, etc.\nFaced with an ageing workforce and the difficulties in the recruitment of collection workers, ENV decided to corporatize the\nSolid waste incineration\nSolid waste incineration has been given a top priority over other waste disposal methods. The Engineering Services Department (ESD) of ENV is in charge of planning, developing, managing and operating the waste incineration facilities in Singapore. Four incineration plants are already in operation (Ulu Pandan, Tuas, Senoko and Tuas South). The fifth incineration plant will be built adjacent to the Tuas South Incineration Plant by a private sector on a Design, Build, Own and Operation (DBOO)\nSanitary landfill\nLandfilling has the lowest priority in the management of solid waste in Singapore, although it plays the most important role in many other countries (Eighmy and Kosson, 1996, Muttamara et al., 1996, Sawell et al., 1996). Because of the land constraint, landfill capacity in Singapore is principally reserved for waste that cannot be treated otherwise.\nQuantity of solid waste disposed of by landfill since 1976 is also given in Table 4. As can be seen from the Table, landfilling once was the sole\nWaste minimization\nWaste minimization has been placed at the top of solid waste management hierarchy. Waste minimization consists of two basic operations: source reduction and recycling (Hopper et al., 1993). Source reduction is most desirable to avoid waste generation, while recycling is useful to conserve resources and to prevent materials from entering the waste stream.\nIn the early stages of Singapore's economic development (during the 1960s and 1970s), waste was separated to recover the recyclable and\nFuture challenges\nWaste minimization will remain to be one of the major challenges and needs to be implemented more strictly. Currently, there is no limitation on the amount of solid waste that may be generated. While industrial and institutional solid waste may be more easily controlled, minimization of residential solid waste will continue to be difficult. Residential solid waste is currently charged at a fixed rate of fee per household for the generation/collection, and has no limitation/control in the actual\nConclusion\nRapid industrialization and economic development has caused tremendous increase of solid waste generation in Singapore. The output of industrial solid waste has exceeded domestic solid waste and becomes the major solid waste stream. Because of the very limited landfill capacity for waste disposal and the need to conserve this limited capacity for future, landfilling of solid waste in Singapore has been opted as the least desirable disposal method.

To maximize resource utilization of MSW and its elimination, numerous efforts have been devoted worldwide to develop a systematic MSW management coupled with technologies in treatment and resource utilization (TTRU). This paper mainly focuses on MSW in eight eastern coastal regions in China on the aspects of background information (MSW generation, population, gross domestic product (GDP)/gross regional product (GRP)), related laws (acts, regulations), MSW characteristics (composition, separation, collection, transport) and TTRU. Besides, emerging technologies in MSW resource utilization for waste-to-energy (WtE) and waste-to-material (WtM) are reviewed for the first time. Finally, a comparison based on above information is conducted between China and selected developed regions, namely Berlin, Tokyo, and Singapore. The findings for China are summarized as follows: (1) MSW generation keeps a strong increasing trend especially in Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shandong, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces, while MSW generation shows spatiotemporal variation in eastern coastal cities, provinces, and special zones; (2) MSW composition characteristics is complicated with a >50% moisture content and is dominated by 52.8–65.3% kitchen waste, 3.5–11.9% paper, and 9.9–19.1% rubber & plastics; (3) MSW management system needs to be optimized in China; (4) The MSW is treated by 52% landfill, 45% incineration and 3% composting technologies and utilization efficiency in China is much lower than that of developed countries; (5) Advanced and emerging technologies for MSW resource utilization are required and several potential WtE and WtM technologies are listed. Eventually, (6) Recommendations for developing an optimal system integrating MSW management with enhanced TTRU are presented, and technology transfer potentials from Berlin, Tokyo, and Singapore are noted.\n\n\nRecent advances in municipal landfill leachate: A review focusing on its characteristics, treatment, and toxicity assessment\n2020, Science of the Total Environment\nShow abstract\nNowadays, sanitary landfilling is the most common approach to eliminate municipal solid waste, but a major drawback is the generation of heavily polluted leachates. These leachates must be appropriately treated before being discharged into the environment. Generally, the leachate characteristics such as COD, BOD/COD ratio, and landfill age are necessary determinants for selection of suitable treatment technologies. Rapid, sensitive and cost-effective bioassays are required to evaluate the toxicity of leachate before and after the treatment. This review summarizes extensive studies on leachate treatment methods and leachate toxicity assessment. It is found that individual biological or physical-chemical treatment is unable to meet strict effluent guidelines, whereas a combination of biological and physical-chemical treatments can achieve satisfactory removal efficiencies of both COD and ammonia nitrogen. In order to assess the toxic effects of leachate on different trophic organisms, we need to develop an appropriate matrix of bioassays based on their sensitivity to various toxicants and a multispecies approach using organisms representing different trophic levels. In this regard, a reduction in toxicity of the treated leachate will contribute to assessing the effectiveness of a specific remediation strategy.\n\n\nReview of leaching behavior of municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) ash\n2019, Science of the Total Environment\nShow abstract\nIncineration is widely adopted in modern waste management because it provides an effective way to minimize municipal solid waste that needs to be disposed of in landfills. The ash residue is often disposed by landfilling. Alternatively, the incineration ash may be recycled and reused for various applications. The crucial issues, however, are the leaching of harmful elements during the use and the end-of-life phases. This review summarizes extensive studies on leaching behavior of municipal solid waste incineration ash. Specifically, pollutants generated through leaching, factors governing leaching, methodologies to study leaching, leaching mechanisms, and treatments to reduce leaching. Many types of pollutants are generated through leaching from municipal solid waste incineration ash, in which heavy metals and organic contaminants are the most toxic and concerned. Ash properties, pH and liquid to solid ratio are the main factors governing municipal solid waste incineration ash leaching. Leaching behavior of municipal solid waste incineration ash is complicated and existing methods to evaluate leaching may not be able to represent the field conditions. Solubility and sorption are the two major leaching mechanisms. Many treatment methods have been proposed. However, not all methods are effective and some approaches are associated with high energy and high cost, which makes them less economically feasible and attractive.\n\n\nMunicipal solid waste management in China: Status, problems and challenges\n2010, Journal of Environmental Management\nShow abstract\nThis paper presents an examination of MSW generation and composition in China, providing an overview of the current state of MSW management, an analysis of existing problems in MSW collection, separation, recycling and disposal, and some suggestions for improving MSW systems in the future. In China, along with urbanization, population growth and industrialization, the quantity of municipal solid waste (MSW) generation has been increasing rapidly. The total MSW amount increased from 31.3 million tonnes in 1980 to 212 million tonnes in 2006, and the waste generation rate increased from 0.50 kg/capita/day in 1980 to 0.98 kg/capita/year in 2006. Currently, waste composition in China is dominated by a high organic and moisture content, since the concentration of kitchen waste in urban solid waste makes up the highest proportion (at approximately 60%) of the waste stream. The total amount of MSW collected and transported was 148 million tonnes in 2006, of which 91.4% was landfilled, 6.4% was incinerated and 2.2% was composted. The overall MSW treatment rate in China was approximately 62% in 2007. In 2007, there were 460 facilities, including 366 landfill sites, 17 composing plants, and 66 incineration plants. This paper also considers the challenges faced and opportunities for MSW management in China, and a number of recommendations are made aimed at improving the MSW management system.\n\n\nAnalysing global food waste problem: Pinpointing the facts and estimating the energy content\n2013, Central European Journal of Engineering\n\n\nMunicipal solid waste generation, composition, and management: The world scenario\n2012, Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology\n\n\nView all citing articles on Scopus\nView full text\nCopyright © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

      "raw_content": "Smart Waste Management: How iZeeM is helping environmental service providers in Singapore (Part 2)\n\nThe Need For Smart Waste Management\n\nIn Part 1 of this 3 series article, we established that Singapore generates around 8,559 tonnes of waste daily (recorded in 2018) and discussed the current challenges of waste management. Therefore, it is important for Singapore to adopt advanced technologies to streamline processes, cut costs and create a better system for handling waste.\n\nHow is waste usually managed?\n\nIn Singapore, public waste collectors (PWCs) are appointed by the National Environment Agency (NEA). Typically, the collection service will travel a fixed route with a routine schedule and empty trash regardless of whether it has reached its maximum capacity. This manual method of collection is inefficient and lacks the visibility required for effective waste management. By implementing IoT and advanced technologies, waste management practices can be made more efficient and reduce costs.\n\n\n\nHere are 3 reasons why you should adopt smart waste management.\n\n1. Tracking waste bins and compactors\n\nImplementing sensors to track location, capacity (real time weight or fill level), operating incidents and collection status enable predictive analysis and allows for rescheduling and optimizing routes for better efficient use of resources. This will improve customer experience and enhance overall public hygiene and health level.\n\n2. Optimise fleet resources\n\nWith accurate GPS tracking, you get real time information on driver routes and vehicle records. Tapping on this information allows you to optimize driver routes, resulting in better fuel efficiency and reduced costs. The database of information can also generate easy to read reports so that you can make quick decisions during crucial moments.\n\n3. Improve driver management\n\nBy monitoring driver behaviour and understanding driver behaviour patterns, unsafe driver habits can be identified early on and road accidents can be prevented. Furthermore, greater transparency of driver activities is likely to make drivers more accountable for their road driving behaviour. This makes managing your employees easier and reduces the rate of accidents in the long run, thus resulting in reduced costs and higher productivity.\n\nThis is Part 2 of a 3 series blog on smart waste management, follow this space for more!\n\nEunice Goh\n\n\n\nRecent Comments\n\nCategories\n\nPrevious PostSmart Waste Management: How iZeeM is helping environmental service providers in Singapore (Part 3)\n\nNext PostSmart Waste Management: How iZeeM is helping environmental service providers in Singapore (Part 1)\n\nRelated Posts\n\nSmart Waste Management: How iZeeM is helping environmental service providers in Singapore (Part 3)\n\nSmart Waste Management: How iZeeM is helping environmental service providers in Singapore (Part 1)\n\n5 things to look for in a fleet management solution provider\n\nCompany\n\nAbout Us\n\nSolutions\n\niZeeFLEET – Fleet Management System\niZeeDRIVE – Smart Surveillance & Security System \niZeeTRACE – Asset Management System\niZeeTRAX – Transport Management System\niZeeSYNC – IoT Device Management Platform\n\nResources\n\nArticles\nCase Studies\nNews & Media\nTestimonials\n Certifications and Awards\n\nSupport\n\nSupport Portal\nKnowledge Base\n\nContact\n\nFrontier\n52 Ubi Ave 3, #05-38\nSingapore 408867\n\nOffice: +65 6589 8839\nE-Mail: askme@izeem.com\n\n© 2025 iZeeM. \n\t\t\t\t\t   All Rights Reserved, iZeeM Pte Ltd\n\n"
