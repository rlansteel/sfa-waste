However, landfilling remains the dominant treatment method at over 55%. Key challenges include reducing landfill reliance, improving separate collection systems, incentivizing proper sorting, diversifying treatment methods, and expanding recycling/composting infrastructure to meet EU targets. Spain has a comprehensive regulatory framework through laws like the Law 7/2022 promoting circular economy principles and mandating implementation of cost-reflective waste fees by 2025.",

      "scale_and_rate": "Spain generated around 22.4 million tons of municipal solid waste in the latest available data, with a per capita generation rate of around 475 kg/person/year. Some reports suggest total waste generation has followed a decreasing trend in recent years, while waste generation excluding major mineral waste has increased overall, roughly following trends in economic growth.",
      "contributing_factors_trends": "Spain's waste generation is influenced by factors such as tourism (which can contribute to increased waste, especially in coastal areas), industrial and commercial activities, and population growth. According to national plans, the service sector and consumption patterns are major drivers of municipal waste generation. However, specific quantitative trends for these contributing factors were not found in the provided sources."

Expanding collection coverage to unserved areas may also be a challenge, though the extent is unclear from available information."

Some reports suggest efforts to increase recycling and composting rates, while reducing landfilling. However, landfilling remains the most prevalent method.",

The national waste management plan aims to improve separate collection systems and sorting infrastructure.",

It mandates the implementation of a specific waste fee by April 2025 to reflect the real costs of waste services. According to some reports, Spain also has a National Waste Management Framework Plan (PEMAR) that provides guidance for regional waste plans. The Ministry for Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge oversees waste policies and regulations.",
