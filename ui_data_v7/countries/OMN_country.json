Working within this framework, assigned operating companies has undertaken several key initiatives to enhance waste management in Oman: 1. Infrastructure Development: Recognizing the importance of proper waste disposal, focusing on establishing the necessary infrastructure. This has involved the closure of all open dumpsites and the establishment of Engineered Landfills. 2. Restructuring Municipal Waste Collection Services: To optimize waste collection processes, Oman has implemented a comprehensive restructuring of municipal waste collection services. This has resulted in improved efficiency and effectiveness in waste collection and transportation to designated facilities. 3. Public Awareness Improvement: Oman has placed great emphasis on raising public awareness about waste management. Through targeted campaigns and educational initiatives, they aim to enhance public understanding and participation in waste reduction, proper segregation, and recycling practices. 4. Expansion into Industrial and Healthcare Waste Management: Starting in 2018, Oman expanded its scope to include the management of industrial and healthcare waste. This expansion ensures the safe and responsible handling, transportation, and disposal of these specialized waste streams."
